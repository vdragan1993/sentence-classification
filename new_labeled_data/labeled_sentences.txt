MISC	the minimum description length principle for online sequence estimation/prediction in a proper learning setup is studied
MISC	if the underlying model class is discrete, then the total expected square loss is a particularly interesting performance measure: (a) this quantity is finitely bounded, implying convergence with probability one, and (b) it additionally specifies the convergence speed
MISC	for mdl, in general one can only have loss bounds which are finite but exponentially larger than those for bayes mixtures
AIMX	we show that this is even the case if the model class contains only bernoulli distributions
OWNX	we derive a new upper bound on the prediction error for countable bernoulli classes
OWNX	this implies a small bound (comparable to the one for bayes mixtures) for certain important model classes
OWNX	we discuss the application to machine learning tasks such as classification and hypothesis testing, and generalization to countable classes of iid models
MISC	``bayes mixture", ``solomonoff induction", ``marginalization", all these terms refer to a central induction principle: obtain a predictive distribution by integrating the product of prior and evidence over the model class
CONT	in many cases however, the bayes mixture is computationally infeasible, and even a sophisticated approximation is expensive
MISC	the mdl or map (maximum a posteriori) estimator is both a common approximation for the bayes mixture and interesting for its own sake: use the model with the largest product of prior and evidence
MISC	in practice, the mdl estimator is usually being approximated too, since only a local maximum is determined
MISC	how good are the predictions by bayes mixtures and mdl
MISC	this question has attracted much attention
MISC	in many cases, an important quality measure is the  total  or cumulative  expected loss  of a predictor
MISC	in particular the square loss is often considered
MISC	assume that the outcome space is finite, and the model class is continuously parameterized
MISC	then for bayes mixture prediction, the cumulative expected square loss is usually small but unbounded, growing with  symbol , where  symbol  is the sample size  citation
MISC	this corresponds to an  instantaneous  loss bound of  symbol
MISC	for the mdl predictor, the losses behave similarly  citation  under appropriate conditions, in particular with a specific prior
MISC	note that in order to do mdl for continuous model classes, one needs to  discretize  the parameter space, see also  citation
MISC	on the other hand, if the model class is discrete, then solomonoff's theorem  citation  bounds the cumulative expected square loss for the bayes mixture predictions finitely, namely by  symbol , where  symbol  is the prior weight of the ``true" model  symbol
MISC	the only necessary assumption is that the true distribution  symbol  is contained in the model class, ie that we are dealing with  proper learning
MISC	it has been demonstrated  citation , that for both bayes mixture and mdl, the proper learning assumption can be essential: if it is violated, then learning may fail very badly
MISC	for mdl predictions in the proper learning case, it has been shown  citation  that a bound of  symbol  holds
MISC	this bound is exponentially larger than the solomonoff bound, and it is sharp in general
MISC	a finite bound on the total expected square loss is particularly interesting:   it implies convergence of the predictive to the true probabilities with probability one
MISC	in contrast, an instantaneous loss bound of  symbol  implies only convergence in probability
MISC	additionally, it gives a  convergence speed , in the sense that errors of a certain magnitude cannot occur too often
MISC	so for both, bayes mixtures and mdl, convergence with probability one holds, while the convergence speed is exponentially worse for mdl compared to the bayes mixture
MISC	we avoid the term ``convergence rate" here, since the order of convergence is identical in both cases
MISC	it is eg  symbol  if we additionally assume that the error is monotonically decreasing, which is not necessarily true in general)
MISC	it is therefore natural to ask if there are model classes where the cumulative loss of mdl is comparable to that of bayes mixture predictions
AIMX	in the present work, we concentrate on the simplest possible stochastic case, namely discrete bernoulli classes
OWNX	note that then the mdl ``predictor" just becomes an estimator, in that it estimates the true parameter and directly uses that for prediction
OWNX	nevertheless, for consistency of terminology, we keep the term predictor
MISC	it might be surprising to discover that in general the cumulative loss is still exponential
OWNX	on the other hand, we will give mild conditions on the prior guaranteeing a small bound
MISC	moreover, it is well-known that the instantaneous square loss of the maximum likelihood estimator decays as  symbol  in the bernoulli case
MISC	the same holds for mdl, as we will see
MISC	if convergence speed is measured in terms of instantaneous losses, then much more general statements are possible  citation , this is briefly discussed in section
MISC	a particular motivation to consider discrete model classes arises in algorithmic information theory
MISC	from a computational point of view, the largest relevant model class is the class of all computable models on some fixed universal turing machine, precisely prefix machine  citation
MISC	thus each model corresponds to a program, and there are countably many programs
MISC	moreover, the models are stochastic, precisely they are  semimeasures  on strings (programs need not halt, otherwise the models were even measures)
MISC	each model has a natural description length, namely the length of the corresponding program
MISC	if we agree that programs are binary strings, then a prior is defined by two to the negative description length
MISC	by the kraft inequality, the priors sum up to at most one
MISC	also the bernoulli case can be studied in the view of algorithmic information theory
MISC	we call this the  universal setup : given a universal turing machine, the related class of bernoulli distributions is isomorphic to the countable set of computable reals in  symbol
MISC	the description length  symbol  of a parameter  symbol  is then given by the length of its shortest program
MISC	a prior weight may then be defined by  symbol
MISC	if a string  symbol  is generated by a bernoulli distribution with computable parameter  symbol , then with high probability the two-part complexity of  symbol  with respect to the bernoulli class does not exceed its algorithmic complexity by more than a constant, as shown by vovk  citation
MISC	that is, the two-part complexity with respect to the bernoulli class  is  the shortest description, save for an additive constant
MISC	many machine learning tasks are or can be reduced to sequence prediction tasks
MISC	an important example is classification
MISC	the task of classifying a new instance  symbol  after having seen (instance,class) pairs  symbol  can be phrased as to predict the continuation of the sequence  symbol
MISC	typically the (instance,class) pairs are iid
MISC	cumulative loss bounds for prediction usually generalize to prediction  conditionalized  to some inputs  citation

MISC	these quantities are parameterizations of the   cavity distributions     i e   the  distribution over neighbor variables of a central variable which has been removed from the graph
MISC	the bethe approximation and bp are recovered when this  cavity distribution is assumed to factorize  whereas the first order correction to the local update equations is obtained when one takes into account the pair cumulants  citation
MISC	estimation of these pair cumulants is possible with extra runs of bp  allowing for new polynomial time algorithms  reducing errors to order    when applying algorithms of which running time scales with an extra factor  of    citation
MISC	although this scaling seems heavy  the large benefit of the approach is that it does not require selection of basic clusters or underlying  tree structures  since it takes into account the effect of all loops that contribute to nontrivial correlations in the cavity distribution at once
MISC	the above   loop correction    strategy is applicable in the class of models where a perturbative expansion around the bethe approximation makes sense  i e   in models with large loops and relatively weak interactions
MISC	the principal requirement  is that the magnitude of pair variable cumulants of cavity distributions is an order smaller than the  single variable cumulants  and third order cumulants are even smaller  etc

MISC	these quantities are parameterizations of the ``cavity distributions'',  i e , the  distribution over neighbor variables of a central variable which has been removed from the graph
MISC	the bethe approximation and bp are recovered when this  cavity distribution is assumed to factorize, whereas the first order correction to the local update equations is obtained when one takes into account the pair cumulants  citation
MISC	estimation of these pair cumulants is possible with extra runs of bp, allowing for new polynomial time algorithms, reducing errors to order  symbol   when applying algorithms of which running time scales with an extra factor  of  symbol   citation
MISC	although this scaling seems heavy, the large benefit of the approach is that it does not require selection of basic clusters or underlying  tree-structures, since it takes into account the effect of all loops that contribute to nontrivial correlations in the cavity distribution at once
MISC	the above ``loop correction''  strategy is applicable in the class of models where a perturbative expansion around the bethe approximation makes sense, i e , in models with large loops and relatively weak interactions
MISC	the principal requirement  is that the magnitude of pair variable cumulants of cavity distributions is an order smaller than the  single variable cumulants, and third order cumulants are even smaller, etc
MISC	however, heuristics based on the strategy allow for other good algorithms  performing well outside these parameter regimes  citation
MISC	so far the approach has been developed for discrete variable models on a more abstract  citation  versus practical level  citation

OWNX	we derive the loop corrected belief propagation equations  for simple tractable gaussian models,  yielding a message passing scheme that, besides the correct average marginals, also yields the correct variances

OWNX	a by-product of our loop corrected belief propagation equations is an algorithm that calculates exact covariance matrices for gaussian models like the one discussed in  citation , but without explicitly using linear response

OWNX	we define the loss rank of   as the number of other  fictitious  data   that are fitted better by   than   is fitted by
OWNX	we suggest selecting the model complexity   that has minimal loss rank  lorp 
MISC	unlike most penalized maximum likelihood variants  aic bic mdl   lorp only depends on the regression functions and the loss function
MISC	it works without a stochastic noise model  and is directly applicable to any non parametric regressor  like knn
AIMX	in this paper we formalize  discuss  and motivate lorp  study it for specific regression problems  in particular linear ones  and compare it to other model selection schemes
OWNX	consider a regression or classification problem in which we want to determine the functional relationship   from data    i e   we seek a function   such that   is close to the unknown   for all

OWNX	this prior explains the fact that pathways are fundamentally related  some are involved in transcription  some in signaling  some in synthesis

MISC	here  symbol  denotes the loss on instance  symbol  using the current model  symbol  and  symbol , the empirical risk, is the average loss on the training set
MISC	the regularizer  symbol  acts as a penalty on the complexity of the classifier and prevents overfitting

BASE	using a very old result of nesterov  citation  we obtain an algorithm for svms which only requires  symbol  iterations to converge to an  symbol  accurate solution; each iteration of the algorithm requires  symbol  work
OWNX	although we primarily focus on the regularized risk minimization with the binary hinge loss, our algorithm can also be used whenever the empirical risk is piecewise linear and contains a small number of pieces

MISC	regularized risk minimization with the binary hinge loss and its variants lies at the heart of many machine learning problems
MISC	bundle methods for regularized risk minimization (bmrm) and the closely related svmstruct are considered the best general purpose solvers to tackle this problem
MISC	it was recently shown that bmrm requires  symbol  iterations to converge to an  symbol  accurate solution
AIMX	in the first part of the paper we use the hadamard matrix to construct a regularized risk minimization problem and show that these rates cannot be improved
AIMX	we then show how one can exploit the structure of the objective function to devise an algorithm for the binary hinge loss which converges to an  symbol  accurate solution in  symbol  iterations
MISC	let  symbol  denote samples and  symbol  be the corresponding labels
MISC	given a training set of  symbol  sample label pairs  symbol , drawn iid from a joint probability distribution on  symbol , many machine learning algorithms solve the following regularized risk minimization problem:     
MISC	here  symbol  denotes the loss on instance  symbol  using the current model  symbol  and  symbol , the empirical risk, is the average loss on the training set
MISC	the regularizer  symbol  acts as a penalty on the complexity of the classifier and prevents overfitting
MISC	usually the loss is convex in  symbol  but can be nonsmooth while the regularizer is usually a smooth strongly convex function
MISC	binary support vector machines (svms) are a prototypical example of such regularized risk minimization problems where  symbol  and the loss considered is the binary hinge loss:    
MISC	recently, a number of solvers have been proposed for the regularized risk minimization problem
MISC	the first and perhaps the best known solver is svmstruct  citation , which was shown to converge in  symbol  iterations to an  symbol  accurate solution
MISC	the convergence analysis of svmstruct was improved to  symbol  iterations by  citation
MISC	in fact,  citation  showed that their convergence analysis holds for a more general solver than svmstruct namely bmrm (bundle method for regularized risk minimization)
MISC	at every iteration bmrm replaces  symbol  by a piecewise linear lower bound  symbol  and optimizes    to obtain the next iterate  symbol
MISC	here  symbol  denotes an arbitrary subgradient of  symbol  at  symbol  (see section ) and  symbol
MISC	the piecewise linear lower bound is successively tightened until the gap     falls below a predefined tolerance  symbol
MISC	even though bmrm solves an expensive optimization problem at every iteration, the convergence analysis only uses a simple one-dimensional line search to bound the decrease in  symbol
MISC	furthermore, the empirical convergence behavior of bmrm is much better than the theoretically predicted rates on a number of real life problems
MISC	it was therefore conjectured that the rates of convergence of bmrm could be improved
AIMX	in this paper we answer this question in the negative by explicitly constructing a regularized risk minimization problem for which bmrm takes at least  symbol  iterations

MISC	in females  however  spatial cognition would have been primarily shaped by the natural selection of a strong concern for survival both of self and of offspring

MISC	in the field of intertemporal choice, the discounted-utility du theory proposed by paul samuelson in 1937 was presented not only as a valid normative standard but also as a descriptive theory of actual intertemporal choice behavior  citation
MISC	in its general form, the du theory proposes that the value of an option, x; t, is the product of its present utility, ux, and an exponential temporal discounting function, ft, where t is the time at which x is acquired
MISC	the overall value of a mixed option, a = {x, t, x, t, }, denoted va, is simply the sum of these products
MISC	that is, va = sigma  ux ft
MISC	an option a will be preferred to an option b if and only if va  greater than  vb
MISC	however, a large body of empirical evidence demonstrates that people systematically violate this theory
MISC	this includes the common difference effect, the magnitude effect, the gain-loss asymmetry, the delay-speedup asymmetry, and so on  citation
MISC	this situation has led researchers to consider extensions and modifications of the du theory to reconcile it with the experimental data
MISC	the most prominent idea to account for these anomalies is the hyperbolic discounting model  citation
MISC	this model suggests that the discount rate is not dynamically consistent but that the rate is higher between the present and near future and lower between the near and far distant future
MISC	numerous theories have been developed by transforming the discount function to other forms, from one-parameter hyperbolic discounting  citation  to generalized hyperbolic discounting  citation , to proportional discounting  citation , and to quasi-hyperbolic discounting  citation
MISC	however, these models focus on intertemporal choice between pairs of single-dated outcomes represented as pure gains or losses
MISC	when these models are applied to intertemporal choice between pairs of multiple-dated outcomes in mixed contexts, there is general agreement on the additive assumption and the independence assumption
MISC	with an apt transformation of the discounting rate, the additive assumption means that preferences for outcome sequences are based on a simple aggregation of their individual components within intertemporal choice  citation
MISC	the independence assumption means that the value or utility of an outcome in one period is independent of outcomes in other periods  citation
MISC	because risk and delay might be psychologically equivalent, or at least analogous, and because similar psychological processes might underlie risk and intertemporal choice  citation , theoretical development in intertemporal choice has progressed steadily along a similar route as that of risky choice  citation

MISC	the well-known allais paradox  citation  contradicts the fundamental postulates of maximizing the expected utility of a risky option

MISC	since then, many new descriptive theories of risky choice have abandoned the maximization assumption  citation
MISC	most models of intertemporal choice have not yet abandoned the additive assumption and the independence assumption
MISC	these two assumptions would lead to the cancellation axiom, which indicates that a preference between two sequences with elements in common does not depend on the nature of the common elements
MISC	table 1 illustrates an example of the multiple-dated outcomes problem, which would be used to test the cancellation axiom
MISC	in problem i, the additive models predict that adding a common element x at time 2 to both option a and option b would not change the preference orderings

AIMX	 we test in the context of a dictator game the proposition that individuals may experience a self-control conflict between the temptation to act selfishly and the better judgment to act pro-socially
OWNX	 we manipulated the likelihood that individuals would identify self-control conflict, and we measured their trait ability to implement self-control strategies
OWNX	 our analysis reveals a positive and significant correlation between trait self-control and pro-social behavior in the treatment where we expected a relatively high likelihood of conflict identification-but not in the treatment where we expected a low likelihood
MISC	 the magnitude of the effect is of economic significance
OWNX	 we conclude that subtle cues might prove sufficient to alter individuals' perception of allocation opportunities, thereby prompting individuals to draw on their own cognitive resources to act pro-socially
MISC	 lured by temptation, individuals may find themselves acting against their better judgment
MISC	 self-control failure, famously termed akrasia in plato's protagoras  citation , persists throughout domains of daily life and represents a central issue of both philosophy and modern-day social sciences
MISC	 for example, the dieter faced with the opportunity to indulge in a delicious creamy cake may perceive a conflict between indulging and maintaining a good figure
MISC	 the student may feel conflicted between the desire to go to the cinema and her better judgment to stay home and study
MISC	 and, similarly, the fashionista might feel conflicted between the temptation to purchase new boots and her better judgment to maintain a responsible budget
MISC	 perhaps less intuitively, but no less importantly, the question of pro-social versus selfish behavior may be understood in similar terms
MISC	 this conceptualization may help reconcile conflicting notions in economics of selfish and pro-social motivations
MISC	 that individuals should care much about their own self-interest seems almost tautological and requires little further exposition, but that individuals also should care about the interest of others-at the expense of that of their own-has attracted considerable attention  citation
MISC	 for example, many individuals voluntarily contribute to charity or to public goods e g , recycling, and they pay their taxes despite low likelihood of punishment for failing to do so
MISC	 nonetheless, one could imagine that even individuals of generally pro-social inclination on occasion may feel tempted to act selfishly and hence underreport income to the authorities
MISC	 that is, pro-social preferences potentially fly in the face of basic urges for personal gain-or greed-and the individual may thus experience a self-control conflict between better judgment to act pro-socially and the temptation to act selfishly
MISC	 self-control-our capacity to overrule temptation-is no less complex than it is important
MISC	 a multitude of conceptualizations exist, many of which are complementary
MISC	 typically, and in line with classic ideas of the conflict between reason and passion, authors view self-control as a "cold" executive function that guides behavior in the face of "hot" impulses to act against better judgment  citation
MISC	 willpower, then, represents the combined resources that the executive function-or the planner, in the parlance of thaler and shefrin  citation -brings to bear in a deliberate struggle against temptation  citation
MISC	 such resources may include cognitive strategies to divert attention away from temptation  citation , strategies of pre-commitment  citation , or possibly the sheer strength of mind to hold back from the song of the sirens
OWNX	 our conceptualization of self-control mirrors these
MISC	 only recently has the psychological literature started to explore how the question of pro-social versus selfish behavior relates to that of self-control
MISC	 loewenstein  citation  suggests that selfish behavior may be motivated by visceral urges or drive-states, resembling cravings for relief from hunger, pain, and sexual deprivation
MISC	 o'donoghue and loewenstein  citation  argue that such selfish urges may conflict with the "colder", more abstract preferences for altruism, as visceral urges for sweets may conflict with more abstract preferences for a fine figure or good health
CONT	 at present, there is but indirect evidence for this idea
MISC	 for example, pronin et al citation  show that decisions about others resemble decisions about "future selves", both classes of which contrast to decisions about less abstract "present selves"
MISC	 albrecht et al citation  report consistent results; individuals who choose between immediate and delayed rewards for themselves exhibit less patience and more affective involvement activation in the dopaminergic reward system than do individuals who make such choices for others-or for themselves in the future
MISC	 moreover, curry et al citation  find in a standard public goods game that individuals' discount rates are negatively associated with their contributions to the public good
MISC	 that is, more "impatient" individuals contributed less to the public good than did "patient" ones
MISC	 arriving at similar results, fehr and leibbrandt  citation  report that patient vs impatient fishermen, whose time preferences were elicited in the lab, exhibited more cooperative behavior in a common resource problem and were in the field less likely to over-exploit the common pool resource
MISC	 furthermore, burks et al citation  find that "short-term" patience-the  beta   in the  beta  -&#x3b4;  model-is positively associated with cooperative behavior in a sequential prisoner's dilemma
MISC	 however, duffy and smith  citation  report no effect of cognitive load-a manipulation intended to deplete cognitive resources and thereby impair self-control-on outcomes across treatments in a repeated multi-player prisoner's dilemma
MISC	 an emerging literature on the "default" response in games of trust and reciprocity lends further credence to the notion that altruistic responses require self-control
MISC	 achtziger et al citation  subjected players in an ultimatum game to cognitive resource depletion, and show that depleted proposers made lower offers-they became less altruistic
MISC	 moreover, depleted responders were more likely to reject offers that were unfair to themselves-they exhibited "altruistic punishment"
MISC	 halali et al citation  report the same for responders, but with a different depletion task
MISC	 crockett et al citation  subjected responders to acute tryptophan depletion-a procedure that temporarily reduces serotonin levels in the brain and thereby impairs self-control  citation ; reduced serotonin levels raised rejection rates and this reduction is positively correlated with impulsive choice in a delay-discounting task  citation
MISC	 using a trust game, knoch et al citation  subjected trustees' right lateral prefrontal cortex to transcranial magnetic stimulation, which reduces functioning in the targeted brain region
MISC	 trustees, though cognizant that returning a share of the investments was both strategic and norm-compliant, were unable to do so under impaired executive functioning; self-control seems necessary to act on the better judgment to resist the temptation to keep the received investment entirely for oneself
BASE	 closest to our domain of inquiry, piovesan and wengstrom  citation  measured response times of participants in a repeated dictator game, lasting 24 periods
MISC	 they find both across and within participants that lower response times are associated with more selfish choices
MISC	 one interpretation of their results is that the default behavior is to act selfishly and that pro-social behavior requires the successful resolution of a self-control conflict, which slows the response time
MISC	 such successful resolution of conflict would require cognitive resources, but hauge et al citation  report no effect of cognitive load on players in one-shot dictator games
AIMX	 in this paper we attempt a more direct test of the hypothesis that pro-social versus selfish behavior may represent a self-control problem
OWNX	 we employ a standard measure of pure pro-social behavior, the one-shot dictator game, which invokes neither concerns for strategy nor for reciprocity; and a well-grounded psychometric measure of self-control, the rosenbaum self-control schedule  citation
OWNX	 further, we explore the conditions under which we expect an association between self-control and pro-social behavior
OWNX	 in so doing, we rely on two conditions necessary for successfully exercising restraint in the face of temptation; myrseth and fishbach  citation  propose a two-stage model of self-control, which postulates that an individual in the face of temptation first identifies conflict or not between indulging and pursuing a higher-order goal and, second, that the individual next employs self-control strategies if and only if conflict was identified at the first stage see figure 1
MISC	 critically, self-control strategies are relevant to the decision to indulge only when the individual has identified self-control conflict
MISC	 therefore, one strategy for investigating whether the problem of pro-social versus selfish behavior resembles one of self-control is to test whether the tendency to apply self-control strategies is positively associated with pro-social behavior when individuals have identified self-control conflict, but less so or not at all when individuals have not
MISC	 determinants of conflict identification in the face of temptation have been explored only recently
MISC	 in some contexts, the question is almost trivial and identification of conflict virtually obvious
MISC	 for example, the diabetic dieter probably knows that having even a single, tempting chocolate may incur major costs
MISC	 however, the question of self-control conflict is more ambiguous for the non-diabetic dieter, who faces the same chocolate
MISC	 having this one chocolate alone will not incur major costs, but doing so regularly might
MISC	 similarly, the good citizen may find that a general failure to act generously would represent a major threat to his self-image, but being stingy on just a couple of occasions is a more ambiguous matter
MISC	 myrseth and fishbach  citation  use the term epsilon cost temptation to denote tempting opportunities that incur nothing but trivial costs when consumed in small amounts, but potentially serious costs when consumed extensively
MISC	 they argue that individuals identify self-control conflict in the face of epsilon cost temptation if and only if two conditions are met: a the focal consumption opportunity must be viewed in relation to multiple additional opportunities, and b the decision maker must assume that similar choices are made for each opportunity  citation
MISC	 that is, considering the question of whether or not to have a delicious creamy cake will evoke self-control conflict in the dieter if the dining opportunity is viewed in relation to future opportunities for dessert consumption, but not if the dining opportunity is viewed in isolation, as a singular episode
MISC	 similarly, the question of whether or not to be generous-to donate to a charitable organization-may elicit self-control conflict if the decision is viewed in relation to future decisions, but not if the decision is viewed in isolation
MISC	 if viewed in relation to future decisions, the question of how much to donate on a single occasion may have bearing on the decision maker's self-image; donating now-and in the future-indicates a generous character, whereas keeping the money for oneself does not
MISC	 however, if viewed in isolation, the question of how much to donate has little bearing on self-image; the present decision of how much to donate is considered only in light of immediate consequences, leaving self-image out of the equation
MISC	 because a consistent self-image represents an important motivator for pro-social behavior  citation , we expect that individuals are more likely to identify self-control conflict between selfish and pro-social behavior if the allocation decision is seen in relation to future opportunities than if it is seen in isolation
MISC	 myrseth and fishbach  citation  show that subtle framing manipulations are sufficient to influence identification of self-control conflict in the face of epsilon cost temptation
MISC	 they find that presenting a calendar displaying the current month, with a grid separating the dates, raised participants' subsequent consumption of potato chips relative to that of participants whom were presented a calendar without a grid
MISC	 they argue that the gridded calendar activated an isolated versus interrelated frame of the choice opportunity; it made participants more likely to isolate the date in question and thus less likely to see the decision task in relation to similar future opportunities
MISC	 consequently, the grid reduced the likelihood that participants would identify a conflict between the temptation to have chips and the better judgment to maintain a fine figure and good health
MISC	 indeed, participants who viewed the gridded calendar reported experiencing less conflict during their decision to have chips or not than did those who viewed the non-gridded calendar
MISC	 furthermore, participants' trait ability to implement self-control strategies, measured by rosenbaum's  citation  psychometric scale, was positively associated with chips consumption for those who viewed the calendar without the grid and who were more likely to identify conflict, but not for others who viewed the calendar with and who were less likely to identify conflict
MISC	 that is, participants who viewed the calendar without the grid, more likely than those who viewed the calendar with, identified self-control conflict and therefore leveraged their self-control strategies to resist the tempting chips
BASE	 to explore our hypothesis that the problem of pro-social versus selfish behavior may represent one of self-control, we have applied the empirical strategy from myrseth and fishbach  citation  in the dictator game-a participant is granted an endowment and asked to split it between herself and a recipient  citation , and in our case the red cross featured as recipient  citation
OWNX	 the game thus pits pro-social motivations against self-interest
OWNX	 if pro-social versus selfish behavior could represent a self-control conflict, we would expect participants' trait self-control, as measured by rosenbaum's  citation  scale, to correlate positively with pro-social behavior for participants who have just previously viewed a calendar without a grid, but less so or not at all for participants who have viewed a calendar with
OWNX	 the graph in figure 2 displays donation, as a function of level of self-control, for two different levels of identification likelihood
OWNX	 in the case of low likelihood, the slope is expected to be weakly positive
OWNX	 in the case of the higher likelihood, however, the slope is expected to be strictly greater than that in the case of low likelihood
OWNX	 this means that for a given level of self-control, one might observe substantially different donation behavior depending on whether conflict was identified or not
AIMX	we test in the context of a dictator game the proposition that individuals may experience a self-control conflict between the temptation to act selfishly and the better judgment to act pro-socially
OWNX	we manipulated the likelihood that individuals would identify self-control conflict, and we measured their trait ability to implement self-control strategies
OWNX	our analysis reveals a positive and significant correlation between trait self-control and pro-social behavior in the treatment where we expected a relatively high likelihood of conflict identification-but not in the treatment where we expected a low likelihood
OWNX	the magnitude of the effect is of economic significance
OWNX	we conclude that subtle cues might prove sufficient to alter individuals' perception of allocation opportunities, thereby prompting individuals to draw on their own cognitive resources to act pro-socially
MISC	lured by temptation, individuals may find themselves acting against their better judgment
MISC	self-control failure, famously termed akrasia in plato's protagoras  citation , persists throughout domains of daily life and represents a central issue of both philosophy and modern-day social sciences
MISC	for example, the dieter faced with the opportunity to indulge in a delicious creamy cake may perceive a conflict between indulging and maintaining a good figure
MISC	the student may feel conflicted between the desire to go to the cinema and her better judgment to stay home and study
MISC	and, similarly, the fashionista might feel conflicted between the temptation to purchase new boots and her better judgment to maintain a responsible budget
MISC	perhaps less intuitively, but no less importantly, the question of pro-social versus selfish behavior may be understood in similar terms
MISC	this conceptualization may help reconcile conflicting notions in economics of selfish and pro-social motivations
MISC	that individuals should care much about their own self-interest seems almost tautological and requires little further exposition, but that individuals also should care about the interest of others-at the expense of that of their own-has attracted considerable attention  citation
MISC	for example, many individuals voluntarily contribute to charity or to public goods e g , recycling, and they pay their taxes despite low likelihood of punishment for failing to do so
MISC	nonetheless, one could imagine that even individuals of generally pro-social inclination on occasion may feel tempted to act selfishly and hence underreport income to the authorities
MISC	that is, pro-social preferences potentially fly in the face of basic urges for personal gain-or greed-and the individual may thus experience a self-control conflict between better judgment to act pro-socially and the temptation to act selfishly
MISC	self-control-our capacity to overrule temptation-is no less complex than it is important
MISC	a multitude of conceptualizations exist, many of which are complementary
MISC	typically, and in line with classic ideas of the conflict between reason and passion, authors view self-control as a "cold" executive function that guides behavior in the face of "hot" impulses to act against better judgment  citation
MISC	willpower, then, represents the combined resources that the executive function-or the planner, in the parlance of thaler and shefrin  citation -brings to bear in a deliberate struggle against temptation  citation
MISC	such resources may include cognitive strategies to divert attention away from temptation  citation , strategies of pre-commitment  citation , or possibly the sheer strength of mind to hold back from the song of the sirens
OWNX	our conceptualization of self-control mirrors these
MISC	only recently has the psychological literature started to explore how the question of pro-social versus selfish behavior relates to that of self-control

MISC	previous tests of cumulative prospect theory cpt and of the priority heuristic ph found evidence contradicting these two models of risky decision making.
CONT	however, those tests were criticized because they had characteristics that might "trigger" use of other heuristics.
AIMX	this paper presents new tests that avoid those characteristics.
OWNX	expected values of the gambles are nearly equal in each choice.
OWNX	in addition, if a person followed expected value ev, expected utility eu, cpt, or ph in these tests, she would shift her preferences in the same direction as shifts in ev or eu
OWNX	in contrast, the transfer of attention exchange model tax and a similarity model predict that people will reverse preferences in the opposite direction
OWNX	results contradict the ph, even when ph is modified to include a preliminary similarity evaluation using the ph parameters
OWNX	new tests of probability-consequence interaction were also conducted
OWNX	strong interactions were observed, contrary to ph
OWNX	these results add to the growing bodies of evidence showing that neither cpt nor ph is an accurate description of risky decision making
AIMX	this paper compares three models that attempt to describe risky decision making
AIMX	these models are cumulative prospect theory cpt  citation , birnbaum's  citation  transfer of attention exchange model tax, and the priority heuristic ph of brandstatter, gigerenzer, and hertwig  citation
MISC	the ph model is based on the idea that people compare one attribute at a time, such as the minimum prizes
BASE	in addition, the similarity model of rubinstein  citation  as modified by leland  citation  is also relevant to these studies, although these studies were not designed to test that model
MISC	birnbaum  citation  reviewed a number of critical tests that refute any rank dependent utility rdu model  citation  including rank and sign-dependent utility  citation , cpt, and expected utility eu
MISC	birnbaum  citation  noted that many of the same tests that refute cpt also contradict the priority heuristic
MISC	for example, the priority heuristic predicted fewer than half of the modal choices analyzed by birnbaum  citation , by birnbaum  citation , and by birnbaum and navarrete  citation
MISC	some of these choices included cases where 90% or more of the participants satisfied stochastic dominance but the priority heuristic predicts indifference
MISC	in other choices, significantly more than half of the participants about 70% of undergraduates violated stochastic dominance, but the priority heuristic predicts that people should satisfy it
MISC	brandstatter, gigerenzer, and hertwig  citation  responded that properties of these choices may have induced people to use other heuristics drawn from a person's "adaptive toolbox
MISC	 presumably, decision makers first decide what rule to use, then they either apply that rule or choose to use another rule
CONT	the mechanism that decides what rule to use has not yet been specified; it is described instead with lists of "triggering conditions," which are estimated from data like parameters
MISC	brandstatter et al citation  concluded that the priority heuristic does not apply when there is a stochastic dominance relation in the choice
MISC	in addition, brandstatter et al citation  argued that certain choices reviewed by birnbaum  citation  used gambles that differed in expected value ev
CONT	brandstatter et al citation  presented a figure to show that the priority heuristic is not accurate when expected values evs differ, which led them to suppose that two strategies are at work, one for "easy" choices that differ in ev and one for "harder" choices where evs are nearly equal
MISC	from the data, brandstatter et al citation  estimated that, when the ratio of ev exceeds 2, people act as if they choose the gamble with the higher ev
MISC	brandstatter et al consider ev ratio as a proxy for the "difficulty" of a choice, but do not necessarily hold that people actually compute ratios of ev
MISC	they argued that the priority heuristic is accurate for "difficult" choices in which evs are nearly equal
CONT	however, birnbaum  citation  noted that ev ratios in birnbaum and navarrete  citation  had been inside the region where ph is supposed to apply; in that study, the priority heuristic failed to reproduce even half of the modal choices correctly
MISC	brandstatter et al citation  replicated part of that study and their results confirmed that the priority heuristic reproduced fewer than half of the modal choices that they chose for replication  citation
MISC	to account for the results, brandstatter et al noted that birnbaum and navarrete  citation  used many choices in which both gambles of a choice had the same probability distribution and in some choices two branches had the same probability
CONT	ph was not accurate for such choices, so brandstatter, et al citation  theorized that people use a "toting up" heuristic for choices in which two branches had the same probability
MISC	in some of the choices in birnbaum and navarrete  citation , there was a common probability-consequence branch in both choices, which was theorized to trigger editing rules and other heuristics that were called up to account for the failures of the priority heuristic
CONT	the arguments of brandstatter et al citation  might also provide excuses for previous failures of cpt as well
AIMX	this paper devises a new type of test that avoids the exceptions stated above
OWNX	in these tests, one alternative does not stochastically dominate the other, there are no common probability-consequence branches, probabilities of the consequences are not equal, and expected values are nearly equal
CONT	in addition, unlike previous tests, the new tests use shifts in expected value and expected utility to "help" predictions of ph and cpt
OWNX	that is, expected value and expected utility are both manipulated such that, if a person shifts his or her judgments in the same direction as the changes in eu or ev, his or her choices will appear consistent with ph and cpt

MISC	birnbaum  citation  reviewed a number of critical tests that refute any rank dependent utility rdu model  citation  including rank and sign-dependent utility  citation , cpt, and expected utility eu
MISC	birnbaum  citation  noted that many of the same tests that refute cpt also contradict the priority heuristic
MISC	for example, the priority heuristic predicted fewer than half of the modal choices analyzed by birnbaum  citation , by birnbaum  citation , and by birnbaum and navarrete  citation
MISC	some of these choices included cases where 90% or more of the participants satisfied stochastic dominance but the priority heuristic predicts indifference
MISC	in other choices, significantly more than half of the participants about 70% of undergraduates violated stochastic dominance, but the priority heuristic predicts that people should satisfy it
MISC	brandstatter, gigerenzer, and hertwig  citation  responded that properties of these choices may have induced people to use other heuristics drawn from a person's "adaptive toolbox

CONT	the mechanism that decides what rule to use has not yet been specified; it is described instead with lists of "triggering conditions," which are estimated from data like parameters
MISC	brandstatter et al citation  concluded that the priority heuristic does not apply when there is a stochastic dominance relation in the choice
MISC	in addition, brandstatter et al citation  argued that certain choices reviewed by birnbaum  citation  used gambles that differed in expected value ev
CONT	brandstatter et al citation  presented a figure to show that the priority heuristic is not accurate when expected values evs differ, which led them to suppose that two strategies are at work, one for "easy" choices that differ in ev and one for "harder" choices where evs are nearly equal
MISC	from the data, brandstatter et al citation  estimated that, when the ratio of ev exceeds 2, people act as if they choose the gamble with the higher ev
MISC	brandstatter et al consider ev ratio as a proxy for the "difficulty" of a choice, but do not necessarily hold that people actually compute ratios of ev
MISC	they argued that the priority heuristic is accurate for "difficult" choices in which evs are nearly equal

MISC	brandstatter et al citation  replicated part of that study and their results confirmed that the priority heuristic reproduced fewer than half of the modal choices that they chose for replication  citation
MISC	to account for the results, brandstatter et al noted that birnbaum and navarrete  citation  used many choices in which both gambles of a choice had the same probability distribution and in some choices two branches had the same probability
CONT	ph was not accurate for such choices, so brandstatter, et al citation  theorized that people use a "toting up" heuristic for choices in which two branches had the same probability

AIMX	this paper devises a new type of test that avoids the exceptions stated above
OWNX	in these tests, one alternative does not stochastically dominate the other, there are no common probability-consequence branches, probabilities of the consequences are not equal, and expected values are nearly equal

MISC	according to tversky and kahneman's  citation  availability heuristic  people sometimes judge the frequency of events in the world by the ease with which examples come to mind
MISC	this process has generally been demonstrated by asking participants to assess the relative likelihood of two categories in which instances of the first category are more difficult to recall than instances of the second category  despite the fact that instances of the first category are more common in the world
MISC	for instance  kahneman and tversky  citation  found that most people think the letter r more often appears in english words as the first letter than the third letter  presumably because the first letter provides a better cue for recalling instances of words than does the third letter
MISC	in fact  it turns out that r appears more often as the third than first letter in english words
MISC	schwarz et al citation  observed that the classic studies demonstrating the availability heuristic failed to distinguish an interpretation based on ease of retrieval from an alternative interpretation based on content of retrieval in which an event is judged more common when a larger number of examples come to mind
MISC	to tease apart these accounts  schwarz et al citation  asked participants in one   study to list either  number  or  number  examples of assertive or unassertive behavior that they have exhibited and then rate themselves on their overall degree of assertiveness
MISC	participants rated themselves as more assertive after they had listed  number  examples of assertive behavior a relatively easy task rather than  number  examples a relatively difficult task  similarly  they rated themselves as less assertive i e   more unassertive after they had listed  number  rather than  number  examples of unassertive behavior

MISC	when judging their likelihood of success in competitive tasks, people tend to be overoptimistic for easy tasks and overpessimistic for hard tasks the shared circumstance effect; sce
MISC	previous research has shown that feedback and experience from repeated-play competitions has a limited impact on sces
AIMX	however, in this paper, we suggest that competitive situations, in which the shared difficulty or easiness of the task is more transparent, will be more amenable to debiasing via repeated play
OWNX	pairs of participants competed in, made predictions about, and received feedback on, multiple rounds of a throwing task involving both easy- and hard-to-aim objects
OWNX	participants initially showed robust sces, but they also showed a significant reduction in bias after only one round of feedback
OWNX	these and other results support a more positive view than suggested from past research on the potential for sces to be debiased through outcome feedback
MISC	competition abounds in everyday life, where we contend with others for top grades, jobs, trophies, and mates
MISC	when resources are at a premium, it is optimal to enter into competitive environments in which we are certain to fare well and to avoid those in which we are doomed to fail
MISC	however, when people evaluate their likelihood of success in competitions, they are subject to a robust bias: a competitor should consider the strengths and weaknesses of the self and the other competitors  citation , but people often give too much weight to evidence related to their own strengths and weaknesses and too little weight to such evidence about the competitor  citation
MISC	this egocentrism results in overoptimism when the circumstances of the competition are favorable, such as when competitors in a trivia game learn that the questions will be from an easy category-even though they'll be easy for everyone  citation
MISC	egocentrism also results in overpessimism when the circumstances are unfavorable e g , a difficult trivia category
MISC	this phenomenon of being more optimistic when shared competitive circumstances are favorable than when they are not has been dubbed the shared-circumstance effect  citation , and it has been replicated across a variety of settings e g , general knowledge tasks, card games, athletic competitions
MISC	in most previous studies on the sce, participants were presented with novel, non-repeated competitive situations
MISC	these situations did not allow people to learn from past experiences or from feedback within the immediate competitive context
MISC	however, in everyday contexts there are often opportunities to learn how a shared circumstance tends to affect the self, others, and outcomes
MISC	for example, when a tennis tournament is played during a string of windy days, players can have several opportunities to observe how the weather affects themselves and their competitors
MISC	to examine whether egocentrism and sces persist in repeated-play contexts, rose and windschitl  citation  had pairs of participants compete against each other in multiple rounds of a trivia contest that involved easy and hard categories
MISC	in each round, participants estimated their likelihood of beating their competitor, answered trivia questions, and received feedback about who won
MISC	in initial rounds, there were robust sces; participants were much more optimistic about winning easy categories than hard ones
MISC	if they encountered the same hard and easy categories across rounds, the participants learned from feedback
MISC	that is, the sce shrank-but slowly-across six rounds with the same categories
MISC	the sce was never eliminated, even after six rounds
MISC	also, for a seventh round, participants were told there would be new categories
MISC	the sce for that round dramatically and fully rebounded; it was every bit as large as observed for round 1
MISC	these results provide a bleak view of how well people can learn from feedback and avoid sces
MISC	moreover, results from a study by moore and cain  citation , which also used repeated plays with feedback, suggest an even bleaker view
MISC	those researchers also used easy and difficult quizzes as shared-circumstance manipulations, but found virtually no reduction in sces after numerous rounds with feedback
MISC	citation are people's abilities to learn to avoid sces-based on feedback-really as bleak as this prior research might suggest
AIMX	we argue that some shared circumstances are more transparently shared than others, and this may affect how readily people learn to avoid the bias that creates sces-and how easily they can transfer this learning to a slightly new set of shared circumstances
OWNX	by transparently shared, we are referring to how obvious it is that a circumstance that is helpful or hindering to the self will affect others in largely the same way
OWNX	in the present study, we examined the influence of repeated feedback on sces
CONT	however, unlike past research, we used a competition in which the difficulty of the shared circumstance relative to competitions, for example, involving easy and hard trivia categories is more transparently shared
OWNX	in a multi-round paradigm, participants competed in object-tossing competitions
OWNX	in each round, two competitors each had 8 throws per object-attempting to land the object inside a target area
OWNX	there was always one easy-to-aim object e g , a beanbag and one hard-to-aim object e g , a paper plate, which constituted our shared-circumstance manipulation
OWNX	full feedback was given during and after each round, and predictions were solicited before each round and also before a final round with novel objects
OWNX	we suspected that a tossing competition, rather than a trivia competition, would produce less bleak results about the debiasing of sces through repeated play
MISC	in the case of trivia, watching one's competitor fail to answer trivia questions doesn't give any insight about why the category is difficult for that person
MISC	also, knowing that one's competitor struggled on a difficult category does not provide obvious information about why he or she might struggle on another difficult category
MISC	however, in the case of throwing, watching a competitor fail when tossing an object probably illuminates the relevance of specific shared, situational circumstances i e , the properties of the specific objects as well as a more general awareness of the relevance that object properties have on throwing success-for anyone
MISC	for example, seeing a paper plate fly unpredictably will likely give an observer a clear impression that the object will fly unpredictably regardless of who is throwing it
MISC	for participants, this enhances the appreciation that one's struggles are not primarily due to personal characteristics but to properties of the tossed objects; this would then be useful in mitigating egocentrism and sces, even when new objects are introduced
OWNX	consequently, we expected that, even though participants might reveal a robust sce at round 1 prior to any feedback or observations regarding their competitor, they would show a pronounced learning effect after the feedback and observations of round 1
OWNX	that is, they would show significantly reduced sces starting immediately after round 1
OWNX	we also expected that this learning would be generally transferable
MISC	when judging their likelihood of success in competitive tasks, people tend to be overoptimistic for easy tasks and overpessimistic for hard tasks the shared circumstance effect; sce
MISC	previous research has shown that feedback and experience from repeated-play competitions has a limited impact on sces
AIMX	however, in this paper, we suggest that competitive situations, in which the shared difficulty or easiness of the task is more transparent, will be more amenable to debiasing via repeated play
OWNX	pairs of participants competed in, made predictions about, and received feedback on, multiple rounds of a throwing task involving both easy- and hard-to-aim objects
OWNX	participants initially showed robust sces, but they also showed a significant reduction in bias after only one round of feedback
OWNX	these and other results support a more positive view than suggested from past research on the potential for sces to be debiased through outcome feedback
MISC	competition abounds in everyday life, where we contend with others for top grades, jobs, trophies, and mates
MISC	when resources are at a premium, it is optimal to enter into competitive environments in which we are certain to fare well and to avoid those in which we are doomed to fail
MISC	however, when people evaluate their likelihood of success in competitions, they are subject to a robust bias: a competitor should consider the strengths and weaknesses of the self and the other competitors  citation , but people often give too much weight to evidence related to their own strengths and weaknesses and too little weight to such evidence about the competitor  citation
MISC	this egocentrism results in overoptimism when the circumstances of the competition are favorable, such as when competitors in a trivia game learn that the questions will be from an easy category-even though they'll be easy for everyone  citation
MISC	egocentrism also results in overpessimism when the circumstances are unfavorable e g , a difficult trivia category
MISC	this phenomenon of being more optimistic when shared competitive circumstances are favorable than when they are not has been dubbed the shared-circumstance effect  citation , and it has been replicated across a variety of settings e g , general knowledge tasks, card games, athletic competitions
MISC	in most previous studies on the sce, participants were presented with novel, non-repeated competitive situations
MISC	these situations did not allow people to learn from past experiences or from feedback within the immediate competitive context
MISC	however, in everyday contexts there are often opportunities to learn how a shared circumstance tends to affect the self, others, and outcomes
MISC	for example, when a tennis tournament is played during a string of windy days, players can have several opportunities to observe how the weather affects themselves and their competitors
MISC	to examine whether egocentrism and sces persist in repeated-play contexts, rose and windschitl  citation  had pairs of participants compete against each other in multiple rounds of a trivia contest that involved easy and hard categories
MISC	in each round, participants estimated their likelihood of beating their competitor, answered trivia questions, and received feedback about who won
MISC	in initial rounds, there were robust sces; participants were much more optimistic about winning easy categories than hard ones
MISC	if they encountered the same hard and easy categories across rounds, the participants learned from feedback
MISC	that is, the sce shrank-but slowly-across six rounds with the same categories
MISC	the sce was never eliminated, even after six rounds
MISC	also, for a seventh round, participants were told there would be new categories
MISC	the sce for that round dramatically and fully rebounded; it was every bit as large as observed for round 1

AIMX	a new theoretical survey of proteins' resistance to constant speed stretching is performed for a set of 17 134 proteins as described by a structure-based model.
MISC	the proteins selected have no gaps in their structure determination and consist of no more than 250 amino acids.
MISC	our previous studies have dealt with 7510 proteins of no more than 150 amino acids.
MISC	the proteins are ranked according to the strength of the resistance.
MISC	most of the predicted top-strength proteins have not yet been studied experimentally.
MISC	architectures and folds which are likely to yield large forces are identified.
MISC	new types of potent force clamps are discovered.
MISC	they involve disulphide bridges and, in particular, cysteine slipknots.
MISC	an effective energy parameter of the model is estimated by comparing the theoretical data on characteristic forces to the corresponding experimental values combined with an extrapolation of the theoretical data to the experimental pulling speeds.
MISC	these studies provide guidance for future experiments on single molecule manipulation and should lead to selection of proteins for applications.
MISC	a new class of proteins, involving cystein slipknots, is identified as one that is expected to lead to the strongest force clamps known.
MISC	this class is characterized through molecular dynamics simulations.
MISC	atomic force microscopy, optical tweezers, and other tools of nanotechnology have enabled induction and monitoring of large conformational changes in biomolecules.
MISC	such studies are performed to assess structure of the biomolecules, their elastic properties, and ability to act as nanomachines in a cell.
MISC	stretching studies of proteins citation are of a particular current interest and they have been performed for under a hundred of systems.
MISC	interpretation of some of these experiments has been helped by all-atom simulations, such as reported in refs. citation, citation.
CONT	they are limited by of order 100 ns time scales and thus require using unrealistically large constant pulling speeds.
MISC	however, they often elucidate the nature of the force clamp the region responsible for the largest force of resistance to pulling, formula.
MISC	all of the experimental and all-atom simulational studies address merely a tiny fraction of proteins that are stored in the protein data bank citation.
MISC	thus it appears worthwhile to consider a large set of proteins and determine their formula within an approximate model that allows for fast and yet reasonably accurate calculations.
MISC	structure-based models of proteins, as pioneered by go and his collaborators citation and used in several implementations citation citation, seem to be suited to this task especially well since they are defined in terms of the native structures away from which stretching is imposed.
MISC	there are many ways, all phenomenological, to construct a structure-based model of a protein.
MISC	504 of possible variants are enumerated and 62 are studied in details in ref. citation.
MISC	the variants differ by the choice of effective potentials, nature of the local backbone stiffness, energy-related parameters, and of the coarse-grained degrees of freedom.
MISC	the most crucial choice relates to making a decision about which interactions between amino acids count as native contacts.
MISC	comparing formula to the corresponding experimental values in 36 available cases selects several optimal models citation.
MISC	among them, there is one which is very simple and which describes a protein in terms of its formula atoms, as labeled by the sequential index formula.
MISC	this model is denoted by formula which stands for, respectively, the lennard-jones native contact potentials, local backbone stiffness represented by harmonic terms that favor the native values of local chiralities, the contact map in which there are no formula contacts, and the amplitude of the lennard-jones potential, formula, is uniform.
MISC	the contact map is determined by assigning the van der waals spheres to the heavy atoms and by checking whether spheres belonging to different amino acids overlap in the native state citation, citation.
MISC	if they do, a contact is declared as native.
MISC	non-native contacts are considered repulsive.
MISC	application of this criterion frequently selects the formula contacts as native.
MISC	if the contact map includes these contacts the resulting model will be denoted here as formula.
MISC	on average, it performs worse than formula because the formula contacts usually correspond to the weak van der waals couplings as can be demonstrated in a sample of proteins by using a software citation which analyses atomic configurations from the chemical perspective on molecular bonds.
MISC	thus the formula couplings should better be removed from the contact map .
MISC	the survey to determine formula in 7510 model proteins with the number of amino acids, formula, not exceeding 150 and 239 longer proteins has been accomplished twice.
MISC	first within the formula model citation and soon afterwords within the formula model citation.
MISC	the first survey also comes with many details of the methodology whereas the second just presents the outcomes.
MISC	the two surveys are compared in more details in refs. citation, citation.
MISC	the results differ, particularly when it comes to ranking of the proteins according to the value of formula, but they mutually provide the error bars on the findings.
MISC	they both agree, however, on predicting that there are many proteins whose strength should be considerably larger than the frequently studied benchmark the sarcomere protein titin.
MISC	near the top of the list, there is the scaffoldin protein c7a which has been recently measured to have formula of about 480 pn citation.
MISC	other findings include establishing correlations with the cath hierarchical classification scheme citation, citation, such as that there are no strong formula proteins, and identification of several types of the force clamps.
MISC	the large forces most commonly originate in parallel formula that are sheared citation.
MISC	however, there are also clamps with antiparallel formula, unstructured strands, and other kinds.
MISC	the two surveys have been based on the structure download made on july 26, 2005 when the pdb comprised 29 385 entries.
MISC	many of them correspond to nucleic acids, complexes with nucleic acids and with other proteins, carbohydrates, or come with incomplete files and hence the much smaller number of proteins that could be used in the molecular dynamics studies.
MISC	here, we present results of still another survey which is based on a download of december 18, 2008 which contains 54 807 structure files and leads to 17 134 acceptable structures with formula not exceeding 250.
MISC	these structures are then analyzed through simulations based on the formula model.
MISC	the numerical code has been improved to allow for acceleration of calculations by a factor of 2.
MISC	the 190 structures with the top values of formula in units of formula are shown in table 1 and table s1 of the si, together with the values of titin and ubiquitin to provide a scale.
MISC	as argued in the materials and methods section section, the unit of force, formula, is now estimated to be of order 110 pn.
MISC	all of the corresponding proteins are predicted to be much stronger than titin and none but two of them have been studied experimentally yet.
OWNX	in addition to the types of force clamps identified before, we have discovered two new mechanisms of sturdiness.
OWNX	one of them involves a cysteine slipknot and is found to be operational in all of the 13 top strength proteins.
OWNX	in this motif, a slip-loop is pulled out of a cysteine knot-loop.
OWNX	another involves dragging of a single fragment of the main chain across a cysteine knot-loop.
OWNX	the two mechanisms are similar in spirit since both involve dragging of the backbone.
OWNX	however, in the csk case, two fragments of the backbone are participating.
AIMX	we make a more systematic identification of the cath-classified architectures that are linked to mechanical strength and then analyze correlations of the data to the scop-based grouping citation citation.
OWNX	the previous surveys did not relate to the scop scheme.
OWNX	we identify the cath-based architectures and scop-based folds that are associated with the occurrence of a strong resistance to pulling.
MISC	a general observation, however, is that each such group of structures may also include examples of proteins that unravel easily.
MISC	the dynamics of a protein are very sensitive to mechanical details that are largely captured by the contact map and not just by the appearance of a structure.
MISC	on the other hand, if one were to look for mechanically strong proteins then the architectures and folds identified by us should provide a good starting point.
OWNX	we also study the dependence of formula on the pulling velocity and characterize the dependence on formula through distributions of the forces.
MISC	the current third survey has been performed within the same formula model as the second survey citation.
BASE	however, we reuse and extend it here because the editors of biophysical journal retracted the second survey citation.
OWNX	all of the values of formula are deposited at the website link and can by accessed by through the pdb structure code.

MISC	structure-based models of proteins, as pioneered by go and his collaborators citation and used in several implementations citation citation, seem to be suited to this task especially well since they are defined in terms of the native structures away from which stretching is imposed.
MISC	there are many ways, all phenomenological, to construct a structure-based model of a protein.
MISC	504 of possible variants are enumerated and 62 are studied in details in ref. citation.
MISC	the variants differ by the choice of effective potentials, nature of the local backbone stiffness, energy-related parameters, and of the coarse-grained degrees of freedom.
MISC	the most crucial choice relates to making a decision about which interactions between amino acids count as native contacts.
MISC	comparing formula to the corresponding experimental values in 36 available cases selects several optimal models citation.
MISC	among them, there is one which is very simple and which describes a protein in terms of its formula atoms, as labeled by the sequential index formula.
MISC	this model is denoted by formula which stands for, respectively, the lennard-jones native contact potentials, local backbone stiffness represented by harmonic terms that favor the native values of local chiralities, the contact map in which there are no formula contacts, and the amplitude of the lennard-jones potential, formula, is uniform.
MISC	the contact map is determined by assigning the van der waals spheres to the heavy atoms and by checking whether spheres belonging to different amino acids overlap in the native state citation, citation.
MISC	if they do, a contact is declared as native.
MISC	non-native contacts are considered repulsive.
MISC	application of this criterion frequently selects the formula contacts as native.
MISC	if the contact map includes these contacts the resulting model will be denoted here as formula.
MISC	on average, it performs worse than formula because the formula contacts usually correspond to the weak van der waals couplings as can be demonstrated in a sample of proteins by using a software citation which analyses atomic configurations from the chemical perspective on molecular bonds.
MISC	thus the formula couplings should better be removed from the contact map .
MISC	the survey to determine formula in 7510 model proteins with the number of amino acids, formula, not exceeding 150 and 239 longer proteins has been accomplished twice.
MISC	first within the formula model citation and soon afterwords within the formula model citation.
MISC	the first survey also comes with many details of the methodology whereas the second just presents the outcomes.
MISC	the two surveys are compared in more details in refs. citation, citation.
MISC	the results differ, particularly when it comes to ranking of the proteins according to the value of formula, but they mutually provide the error bars on the findings.
MISC	they both agree, however, on predicting that there are many proteins whose strength should be considerably larger than the frequently studied benchmark the sarcomere protein titin.
MISC	near the top of the list, there is the scaffoldin protein c7a which has been recently measured to have formula of about 480 pn citation.
MISC	other findings include establishing correlations with the cath hierarchical classification scheme citation, citation, such as that there are no strong formula proteins, and identification of several types of the force clamps.
MISC	the large forces most commonly originate in parallel formula that are sheared citation.
MISC	however, there are also clamps with antiparallel formula, unstructured strands, and other kinds.
MISC	the two surveys have been based on the structure download made on july 26, 2005 when the pdb comprised 29 385 entries.
MISC	many of them correspond to nucleic acids, complexes with nucleic acids and with other proteins, carbohydrates, or come with incomplete files and hence the much smaller number of proteins that could be used in the molecular dynamics studies.
AIMX	here, we present results of still another survey which is based on a download of december 18, 2008 which contains 54 807 structure files and leads to 17 134 acceptable structures with formula not exceeding 250.
OWNX	these structures are then analyzed through simulations based on the formula model.
OWNX	the numerical code has been improved to allow for acceleration of calculations by a factor of 2.
OWNX	the 190 structures with the top values of formula in units of formula are shown in table 1 and table s1 of the si, together with the values of titin and ubiquitin to provide a scale.
OWNX	as argued in the materials and methods section section, the unit of force, formula, is now estimated to be of order 110 pn.
OWNX	all of the corresponding proteins are predicted to be much stronger than titin and none but two of them have been studied experimentally yet.
OWNX	in addition to the types of force clamps identified before, we have discovered two new mechanisms of sturdiness.
OWNX	one of them involves a cysteine slipknot and is found to be operational in all of the 13 top strength proteins.
OWNX	in this motif, a slip-loop is pulled out of a cysteine knot-loop.
OWNX	another involves dragging of a single fragment of the main chain across a cysteine knot-loop.
OWNX	the two mechanisms are similar in spirit since both involve dragging of the backbone.
OWNX	however, in the csk case, two fragments of the backbone are participating.
OWNX	we make a more systematic identification of the cath-classified architectures that are linked to mechanical strength and then analyze correlations of the data to the scop-based grouping citation citation.
CONT	the previous surveys did not relate to the scop scheme.
OWNX	we identify the cath-based architectures and scop-based folds that are associated with the occurrence of a strong resistance to pulling.
OWNX	a general observation, however, is that each such group of structures may also include examples of proteins that unravel easily.
OWNX	the dynamics of a protein are very sensitive to mechanical details that are largely captured by the contact map and not just by the appearance of a structure.
OWNX	on the other hand, if one were to look for mechanically strong proteins then the architectures and folds identified by us should provide a good starting point.
OWNX	we also study the dependence of formula on the pulling velocity and characterize the dependence on formula through distributions of the forces.
MISC	the current third survey has been performed within the same formula model as the second survey citation.
BASE	however, we reuse and extend it here because the editors of biophysical journal retracted the second survey citation.
OWNX	all of the values of formula are deposited at the website link and can by accessed by through the pdb structure code.
MISC	expansion of polyglutamine tracts in proteins results in protein aggregation and is associated with cell death in at least nine neurodegenerative diseases.
MISC	disease age of onset is correlated with the polyq insert length above a critical value of 35 40 glutamines.
MISC	the aggregation kinetics of isolated polyq peptides in vitro also shows a similar critical-length dependence.
CONT	while recent experimental work has provided considerable insights into polyq aggregation, the molecular mechanism of aggregation is not well understood.
AIMX	here, using computer simulations of isolated polyq peptides, we show that a mechanism of aggregation is the conformational transition in a single polyq peptide chain from random coil to a parallel -helix.
MISC	this transition occurs selectively in peptides longer than 37 glutamines.
OWNX	in the -helices observed in simulations, all residues adopt -strand backbone dihedral angles, and the polypeptide chain coils around a central helical axis with 18.5 2 residues per turn.
OWNX	we also find that mutant polyq peptides with proline-glycine inserts show formation of antiparallel -hairpins in their ground state, in agreement with experiments.
OWNX	the lower stability of mutant -helices explains their lower aggregation rates compared to wild type.
OWNX	our results provide a molecular mechanism for polyq-mediated aggregation.

MISC	aggregation and disease are observed if the number of glutamines in the expansion, n, exceeds a critical value, n c citation.
MISC	the nearly universal existence of this criticality in all polyq-related diseases suggests that when the polyq insert length exceeds a critical value, a pathological change, largely independent of the host protein, occurs in the polyq insert itself.
MISC	therefore, isolated polyq peptides have been used as model systems for studying polyq aggregation citation, citation, citation, and it is known that: the nuclear uptake of polyq peptide aggregates prepared in vitro is cytotoxic in cell cultures citation, isolated polyq peptides have in vitro aggregation properties similar to the corresponding full-length proteins containing the polyq insert citation, citation, peptide aggregation follows a nucleated mechanism showing characteristic lag and growth phases citation, citation, and the glutamine tract-length dependence of the lag-time interval correlates well with the age of onset of disease citation.

AIMX	the present article builds upon previously reported results for whitened amplitude spectra of face images citation : the whitened spectra reveal a spatial frequency maximum at 10 15 cycles per face, but only if external face features are suppressed.

MISC	despite of it all, the results presented in citation indicate that the maxima in the amplitude spectra are caused by the compound effect of horizontally oriented internal face features.
MISC	quantitatively, the maxima thus occur in units of cycles per face height, whereas most psychophysical studies instead measure their results in terms of cycles per face width.
MISC	furthermore, although a clear enhancement of horizontal amplitudes could be observed in the spectra, horizontal amplitudes showed a somewhat noisy dependence on spatial frequency.
MISC	both effects are a consequence of that face features were not considered individually, what causes a mixing of the spatial frequency content of individual face features in the spectra.
MISC	the mixing leads to averaging-out effects such that any possible enhancement of spectral amplitudes at other than the horizontal orientation goes unnoticed, but also may cause interference effects which lead to the mentioned noisy dependence of amplitudes on spatial frequency.
OWNX	the present study addresses the two issues by means of an extensive analysis of face images by means of gabor filters.

OWNX	this reconstruction is the first comprehensive database detailing the available information for these cellular functions and can thus be deemed a knowledge base.
OWNX	after conversion of the e-matrix reconstruction into condition-specific models corresponding to different doubling times, we were able to accurately predict the ribosome production reported in literature, without any parameterization.

AIMX	to discover broad relationships between regulation of alternative splicing and sequence conservation, we applied a systems approach, using oligonucleotide microarrays designed to capture splicing information across the mouse genome.
OWNX	in a set of 22 adult tissues, we observe differential expression of rna containing at least two alternative splice junctions for about 40 percent of the 6,216 alternative events we could detect.
OWNX	statistical comparisons identify 171 cassette exons whose inclusion or skipping is different in brain relative to other tissues and another 28 exons whose splicing is different in muscle.
OWNX	a subset of these exons is associated with unusual blocks of intron sequence whose conservation in vertebrates rivals that of protein-coding exons.
OWNX	by focusing on sets of exons with similar regulatory patterns, we have identified new sequence motifs implicated in brain and muscle splicing regulation.
OWNX	of note is a motif that is strikingly similar to the branchpoint consensus but is located downstream of the 5 splice site of exons included in muscle.
OWNX	analysis of three paralogous membrane-associated guanylate kinase genes reveals that each contains a paralogous tissue-regulated exon with a similar tissue inclusion pattern.
OWNX	while the intron sequences flanking these exons remain highly conserved among mammalian orthologs, the paralogous flanking intron sequences have diverged considerably, suggesting unusually complex evolution of the regulation of alternative splicing in multigene families.
MISC	splicing is an essential process that constructs protein coding messenger rna sequences using tiny segments of information buried in the much larger primary transcripts of the eukaryotic gene.
MISC	regulated alternative splicing can create different protein coding sequences under different biological circumstances, allowing the production of functionally related but distinct proteins.
MISC	in addition, alternative splicing can mediate the repression of gene expression by stimulating the formation of transcripts subject to nonsense-mediated decay citation citation.
MISC	splicing patterns seem distinct in the vertebrate nervous system compared to other tissues citation, citation, and it is tempting to hypothesize that neural alternative splicing contributed to the rapid evolution of the vertebrate brain without large increases in gene number citation .
MISC	biochemical analysis of alternative splicing has shown that numerous rna binding proteins influence the use of specific splice sites to stimulate splicing events that lead to particular mrna isoforms citation, citation.
MISC	these rna binding proteins may activate or repress the use of splice sites by binding to nearby sequences in the exon or in the intron.
MISC	in many cases, multiple rna binding proteins combine to create repressing and activating influences that produce patterns of splicing control citation, citation.
MISC	some proteins, such as sr proteins and the celf proteins, have mostly activating roles, whereas others, such as hnrnp a1, ptb, and nptb, have mostly repressing roles.
MISC	certain proteins can either activate or repress splicing in different contexts, depending on the position of their binding sites or the expression of other rna binding proteins citation, citation .
MISC	a complete catalog of the rna sequences corresponding to the enhancers and silencers bound by splicing regulatory proteins would greatly aid the understanding of splicing regulatory networks.
MISC	thus far, there are only a handful of splicing regulators whose corresponding rna binding motifs have been identified, whereas there may be many splicing regulators among the hundreds of rna binding proteins encoded by the mouse genome.
MISC	in addition, several related but distinct genes produce proteins that bind the same or overlapping sets of sequences; for example, fox-1 and rbm9 each bind ugcaug citation, citation, and the branchpoint binding protein sf1 and the protein quaking each bind uacuaac-like motifs citation citation.
MISC	adding to this complexity is the tendency for the mrnas of rna binding proteins to be alternatively spliced, leading to multiple rna binding protein isoforms with potentially different functions.
CONT	currently, the methods available for expanding the list of known regulators and their target sequences are limited, and the development of this catalog is in the early stage citation .
MISC	much of the available genomic information on alternative splicing is derived by the alignment of large numbers of expressed sequence tags and messenger rnas to genome sequences.
MISC	the analysis of exons that appear to be constitutive or alternative has led to the successful identification of many distinguishing features of alternatively spliced regions citation citation, even allowing their accurate prediction without cdna evidence citation, citation, citation.
CONT	although cdna libraries have been invaluable for discovering general features of alternatively spliced exons, it is difficult to connect specific regulatory sequences to specific biological conditions with confidence due to variable and sometimes missing information about the source materials and methods of cdna library construction.
CONT	the relatively low number of transcripts present from any one gene also makes it difficult to estimate differences in expression levels using library representation as a measure.
CONT	thus, more direct methods are needed to associate alternative splicing events with underlying biological conditions.
MISC	the recent application of microarray technology to questions of splicing and splicing regulation promises to reveal parallel connections between many splicing events and specific biological or experimental conditions citation citation.
CONT	analysis of experimental changes in splicing for many genes simultaneously should reveal biological conditions necessary for proper splicing regulation in a way that analysis of cdna libraries cannot, and with breadth that cannot be achieved by analysis of a reporter construct or a few endogenous target genes.
AIMX	to demonstrate this, we constructed a dna microarray designed to capture splicing information for about 6,200 alternative events in the mouse transcriptome, using a combination of splice junction and exon probes, and have hybridized rna from 22 adult mouse tissues.
AIMX	we examine splicing in these tissues by asking three questions.
OWNX	first we ask, which rna isoforms are present in a particular tissue sample?
OWNX	to answer this simple question, we used a new method based on comparing the intensity of the probes in a probe set to the distribution of intensities from all probes with similar g c level.
BASE	this is similar in spirit although different in approach to the present-absent calls from affymetrix mas 5.0 algorithms citation, as this microarray did not contain mismatch probes.
OWNX	using rt-pcr, we show that this method has a true-positive rate of 85 percent.
OWNX	second we ask, which rna isoforms are differentially expressed across the tissues examined?
OWNX	for each rna isoform, the intensities of the isoform-specific junction probes were examined across tissues using the kruskal-wallis statistical test.
OWNX	after correcting for multiple testing, about 40 percent of the 6,216 total alternative splicing events examined were found to have more than one rna form that was differentially expressed, indicating widespread tissue differences in splicing over the tissues.
OWNX	third we ask, which cassette exons are included differentially between brain and nonbrain tissues?
OWNX	to answer this, we used a regression-based bootstrapping method, which also allows an estimate of the relative change in skipping and inclusion in the two sample groups.
OWNX	we analyzed the intron sequences associated with exon skipping events that are differentially regulated in brain or muscle relative to other tissues and found unusual patterns of sequence conservation that provide new information about tissue regulation of alternative splicing and its evolution.
MISC	human immunodeficiency virus 1 uses for entry into host cells a receptor and one of two co-receptors.
MISC	recently, a new class of antiretroviral drugs has entered clinical practice that specifically bind to the co-receptor ccr5, and thus inhibit virus entry.
MISC	accurate prediction of the co-receptor used by the virus in the patient is important as it allows for personalized selection of effective drugs and prognosis of disease progression.
AIMX	we have investigated whether it is possible to predict co-receptor usage accurately by analyzing the amino acid sequence of the main determinant of co-receptor usage, i.e., the third variable loop v3 of the gp120 protein.
OWNX	we developed a two-level machine learning approach that in the first level considers two different properties important for protein-protein binding derived from structural models of v3 and v3 sequences.
OWNX	the second level combines the two predictions of the first level.
OWNX	the two-level method predicts usage of cxcr4 co-receptor for new v3 sequences within seconds, with an area under the roc curve of 0.937 0.004.
OWNX	moreover, it is relatively robust against insertions and deletions, which frequently occur in v3.
OWNX	the approach could help clinicians to find optimal personalized treatments, and it offers new insights into the molecular basis of co-receptor usage.
OWNX	for instance, it quantifies the importance for co-receptor usage of a pocket that probably is responsible for binding sulfated tyrosine.

MISC	hiv-1 enters human cells in a process that comprises several steps, including the binding of the viral gp120 protein to the cellular receptor protein cd4 and a co-receptor protein, usually one of the two chemokine receptors ccr5 and cxcr4 citation.
MISC	the type of co-receptor used by the virus, the so-called co-receptor tropism, has a prognostic value, since patients with a cxcr4-tropic virus progress faster to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome compared to patients with a ccr5-tropic virus citation.
MISC	in addition to the purely x4- and r5-tropic viruses, there are also dual-tropic strains, able to use both co-receptors.
MISC	recently, the first drug that binds to ccr5, and thus inhibits productive binding of gp120, has been approved by regulatory authorities in several countries.
MISC	this has made the determination of co-receptor tropism directly relevant to anti-retroviral treatment, as ccr5-inhibitors are of course inactive against x4 virus.
MISC	the standard way of determining co-receptor tropism is by cell-based assays citation, citation.
CONT	the main drawbacks of these assays are that they are currently only carried out by a handful of specialized laboratories worldwide, and that the overall procedure typically takes several weeks.
MISC	these impediments to the wide application of entry inhibitors could be overcome by an approach similar to genotypic drug resistance testing citation, where drug resistance of a viral strain is inferred from comparison of mutational patterns obtained from sequencing parts of the genome of that strain with patterns of validated resistance mutations.
MISC	this is a relatively fast and cheap standard procedure established in many clinics.
MISC	at first glance, genotypic testing for co-receptor tropism seems to be possible since the main molecular determinant of tropism is known to be the third variable loop of the viral glycoprotein gp120 citation, a peptide stretch of about 35 amino-acids with a disulfide bridge connecting the terminal cysteins.
CONT	unfortunately, as suggested by its name, v3 is notorious for its high sequence variability citation including also some variability in length, and this has made it difficult to use it as a basis for genotypic co-receptor tropism testing.
MISC	nevertheless, the relevance of the quest has prompted many groups to develop models that link properties of v3 to co-receptor tropism.
MISC	the importance of electrostatics for co-receptor tropism has been recognized early on, and the best-known model, the so-called 11/25-rule, refers to charges of v3-residues 11 and 25: if one of these is positive, then the virus is cxcr4-tropic citation, citation.
MISC	this rule has a specificity of more than 0.9, but only a low to moderate sensitivity of about 0.4 0.6, depending on the test data, which is not satisfactory for routine clinical application.
MISC	to improve predictions from sequence, several groups have applied machine learning methods, such as artificial neural networks citation, position specific scoring matrices citation, decision trees, or support vector machines citation.
CONT	still, prediction accuracies fall short of what seems reasonable for regular clinical use citation.
MISC	it is unclear whether the limited accuracies are the footprint of tropism-determinants outside v3, or the consequence of model imperfections.

MISC	this paved the way for the development of prediction methods that use, in addition to v3 sequence, structural information.
MISC	to our knowledge, the first of these methods has been that of sander et al. citation, which was mainly based on geometric distances of amino-acid pairs within the structure of v3.
BASE	although our method, detailed in the following, relies on the same experimental structure by huang et al. citation, it differs from that of sander et al. in several respects, e.g. it deals with indels, and, perhaps most crucially, it uses as descriptors properties that directly determine interaction of v3 with the co-receptors.
OWNX	by the latter we consider a seemingly trivial but fundamental fact that so far has not been thoroughly exploited: although v3 is highly variable, all x4-tropic v3 loops share one property, namely, they preferentially have a physical binding interaction with cxcr4, while r5-tropic v3 loops preferably interacts with ccr5.
OWNX	the accuracy of the method makes it attractive as clinical tool for patient tailored decisions on treatment with entry inhibitors, and it suggests that co-receptor tropism can be explained almost exclusively based on v3.

MISC	fitness functions based on test cases are very common in genetic programming (gp)
MISC	this process can be assimilated to a learning task, with the inference of models from a limited number of samples
MISC	gp is particularly suited for problems that can be assimilated to learning tasks, with the minimization of the error between the obtained and desired outputs for a limited number of test cases -- the training data, using a ml terminology
MISC	indeed, the classical gp examples of symbolic regression, boolean multiplexer and artificial ant  citation  are only simple instances of well-known learning problems (i e respectively regression, binary classification and reinforcement learning)
MISC	in the early years of gp, these problems were tackled using a single data set, reporting results on the same data set that was used to evaluate the fitnesses during the evolution
MISC	in the ml community, it is recognized that such methodology is flawed, given that the learning algorithm can overfit the data used during the training and perform poorly on unseen data of the same application domain  citation
MISC	hence, it is important to report results on a set of data that was not used during the learning stage
MISC	even though this methodology has been widely accepted and applied in the ml and pr communities for a long time, the ec community still lags behind by publishing papers that are reporting results on data sets that were used during the evolution (training) phase
MISC	this methodological problem has already been spotted (see  citation ) and should be less and less common in the future
MISC	the two data sets methodology prevents reporting flawed results of learning algorithms that overfit the training set
MISC	but this does not prevent by itself overfitting the training set
MISC	this validation set is useful to interrupt the learning algorithm when overfitting occurs and/or select a configuration of the learning machine that maximizes the generalization performances
MISC	this third data set is commonly used to train classifiers such as back-propagation neural networks and can be easily applied to ec-based learning
MISC	but this approach has an important drawback: it removes a significant amount of data from the training set, which can be harmful to the learning process
MISC	indeed, the richer the training set, the more representative it can be of the real data distribution, and the more the learning algorithm can be expected to converge toward robust solutions
MISC	another concern of the ml and pr communities is to develop learning algorithms that generate simple solutions
MISC	an argument behind this is the occam's razor principle, which states that between solutions of comparable quality, the simplest solutions must be preferred
MISC	another argument is the minimum description length principle  citation , which states that the ``best'' model is the one that minimizes the amount of information needed to encode the model and the data given the model
MISC	preference for simpler solutions and overfitting avoidance are closely related: it is more likely that a complex solution incorporates specific information from the training set, thus overfitting the training set, compared to a simpler solution
MISC	but, as mentioned in  citation , this argumentation should be taken with care as too much emphasis on minimizing complexity can prevent the discovery of more complex yet more accurate solutions
MISC	there is a strong link between the minimization of complexity in gp-based learning and the control of code bloat  citation , that is an exaggerated growth of program size in the course of gp runs
MISC	even though complexity and code bloat are not exactly the same phenomenon, as some kind of bloat is generated by neutral pieces of code that have no effect on the actual complexity of the solutions, most of the mechanisms proposed to control it  citation  can also be used to minimize the complexity of solutions obtained by gp-based learning
MISC	this approach is tested on six different data sets from the uci ml repository  citation
MISC	even if the proposed techniques are tested in a specific context, we argue that they can be extended to the frequent situations where gp is used as a learning algorithm
MISC	the task for an agent is to attain the  best possible asymptotic reward where the true generating environment is unknown but belongs to a known countable family of environments
OWNX	we analyze how tight these conditions are and how they relate to different probabilistic assumptions known in reinforcement learning and related fields, such as markov decision processes and mixing conditions
MISC	many real-world ``learning'' problems (like learning to drive a car or playing a game) can be modelled as an agent  symbol  that interacts with an environment  symbol  and is (occasionally) rewarded for its behavior
MISC	if  symbol  is known, it is a pure (non-learning) computational problem to determine the optimal agent  symbol
MISC	it is far less clear what an ``optimal'' agent means, if  symbol  is unknown
MISC	a reasonable objective is to have a single policy  symbol  with high value simultaneously in many environments
OWNX	we will formalize and call this criterion  self-optimizing  later
MISC	reinforcement learning, sequential decision theory,  adaptive control theory, and active expert advice, are theories dealing with this problem
MISC	they overlap but have different core focus: reinforcement learning algorithms  citation  are developed to learn  symbol  or directly its value
MISC	temporal difference learning is computationally very efficient, but has slow asymptotic guarantees (only) in (effectively) small observable mdps
MISC	others have faster guarantee in finite state mdps  citation
MISC	there are algorithms   citation   which are optimal for any finite connected pomdp, and this is apparently the largest class of environments considered
MISC	in sequential decision theory, a bayes-optimal agent  symbol  that maximizes  symbol  is considered, where  symbol  is a mixture of environments  symbol  and  symbol  is a class of environments that contains the true environment  symbol   citation
MISC	policy  symbol  is self-optimizing in an arbitrary class  symbol , provided  symbol  allows for self-optimizingness  citation
MISC	adaptive control theory  citation  considers very simple (from an ai perspective) or special systems (e g \ linear with quadratic loss function), which sometimes allow computationally and data efficient solutions
MISC	action with expert advice  citation  constructs an agent (called master) that performs nearly as well as the best agent (best expert in hindsight) from some class of experts, in  any  environment  symbol
MISC	the important special case of passive sequence prediction in arbitrary unknown environments, where the actions=predictions do not affect the environment is comparably easy  citation
MISC	the difficulty in active learning problems can be identified (at least, for countable classes) with  traps  in the environments
MISC	a well-studied such class are ergodic mdps which guarantee that, from any action history, every state can be (re)visited  citation
OWNX	the aim of this paper is to characterize as general as possible classes  symbol  in which self-optimizing behaviour is possible, more general than pomdps
MISC	further, in many real world problems there is no information available about the ``states'' of the environment (e g \ in pomdps) or the environment may exhibit long history dependencies
OWNX	rather than trying to model an environment (e g by mdp) we try to identify the conditions sufficient for learning
MISC	the performance criterion here is asymptotic average reward
MISC	moreover, the same property should hold after any finite sequence of actions has been taken (no traps)
OWNX	we also show that strong value-stability is in a certain sense necessary
OWNX	we also consider examples of environments which possess strong value-stability
MISC	in particular, any ergodic mdp can be easily shown to have this property
OWNX	finally, we provide a construction allowing to build  examples of  value-stable environments which are not isomorphic to a finite pomdp, thus demonstrating that the class of value-stable environments is quite general
OWNX	it is important in our argument that the class of environments for which we seek a self-optimizing policy is countable, although the class of all value-stable environments is uncountable
MISC	to find a set of  conditions necessary and sufficient for learning which do not rely on countability of the class is yet an open problem
MISC	however, from a computational perspective countable classes are sufficiently large (e g \ the class of all computable probability measures is countable)
OWNX	section~ introduces necessary notation of the agent framework
OWNX	section~ presents the theorem about self-optimizing policies for classes of value-stable environments, and illustrates the  applicability of the theorem by providing examples of strongly value-stable environments
OWNX	in section~ we discuss necessity of the conditions of the main theorem
OWNX	the formal proof of the main theorem is given in the appendix, while section~ contains only intuitive explanations
MISC	most kernel methods for learning on sets of points have not yet dealt with the specific geometrical invariances and practical constraints associated with point clouds in computer vision and graphics
MISC	in recent years, kernels for structured data have been designed in many domains, such as bioinformatics~ citation , speech processing~ citation , text processing~ citation  and computer vision~ citation
MISC	they provide an elegant way of including known  a priori  information, by using directly the natural topological structure of objects
MISC	using a priori knowledge through structured kernels have proved beneficial because it allows to reduce the number of training examples, and to re-use existing data representations that are already well developed by experts of those domains
MISC	the natural geometrical structure of point clouds is hard to represent in a few real-valued features~ citation , in particular because of (a)  the required local or global invariances by rotation, scaling, and/or translation, (b) the lack of pre-established registrations of the point clouds (i e , points from one cloud are not matched to points from another cloud), and (c) the noise and occlusion that impose that only portions of two point clouds ought to be compared
MISC	as shown in \mysec{graphkernels}, by choosing appropriate substructures and fully factorized local kernels, efficient dynamic programming implementations allow to sum over an exponential number of substructures in polynomial time
MISC	however, in the context of computer vision, substructures correspond to matched sets of points, and dealing with local invariances imposes to use a local kernel that cannot be readily expressed as a product of separate terms for each pair of points, and the usual dynamic programming approaches cannot then be applied
OWNX	with this novel local kernel, we derive new polynomial time dynamic programming recursions in \mysec{recursions}
OWNX	in \mysec{simulations}, we present simulations on handwritten character recognition
OWNX	furthermore, we introduce a free parameter  symbol  to regulate the contributions of objects to user-user correlations
MISC	the numerical results indicate that decreasing the influence of popular objects can further improve the algorithmic accuracy and personality
MISC	with the advent of the internet, the exponential growth of the world-wide-web and routers confront people with an information overload  citation
OWNX	we are facing too much data to be able to effectively filter out the pieces of information that are most appropriate for us
MISC	a promising way is to provide personal recommendations to filter out the information
MISC	recommendation systems use the opinions of users to help them more effectively identify content of interest from a potentially overwhelming set of choices  citation
MISC	motivated by the practical significance to the e-commerce and society, various kinds of algorithms have been proposed, such as correlation-based methods  citation , content-based methods  citation , the spectral analysis  citation , principle component analysis  citation , network-based methods  citation , and so on
MISC	for a review of current progress, see ref
MISC	citation  and the references therein
MISC	one of the most successful technologies for recommendation systems, called  collaborative filtering  (cf), has been developed and extensively investigated over the past decade  citation
MISC	when predicting the potential interests of a given user, such approach first identifies a set of similar users from the past records and then makes a prediction based on the weighted combination of those similar users' opinions
MISC	despite its wide applications, collaborative filtering suffers from several major limitations including system scalability and accuracy  citation
MISC	recently, some physical dynamics, including mass diffusion  citation , heat conduction  citation  and trust-based model  citation , have found their applications in personal recommendations
MISC	these physical approaches have been demonstrated to be of both high accuracy and low computational complexity  citation
MISC	for example, the algorithm presented in ref
MISC	citation  runs much faster than standard cf if the number of users is much larger than that of objects, while when the number of objects is huge, the advantage of this algorithm vanishes because its complexity is mainly determined by the number of objects (see ref
MISC	citation  for details)
OWNX	in order to increase the system scalability and accuracy of standard cf, we introduce a network-based recommendation algorithm with spreading activation, namely sa-cf
MISC	compared to the algorithm of  citation , this approach is more directly connected to the usual em algorithm and does not rely on integration with respect to the complete data distribution
MISC	the em (expectation-maximisation) algorithm  citation  is a popular tool for maximum-likelihood (or maximum a posteriori) estimation
MISC	the common strand to problems where this approach is applicable is a notion of  incomplete data , which includes the conventional sense of missing data but is much broader than that
MISC	problems where the em algorithm has proven to be useful include, among many others, mixture of densities  citation , censored data models  citation , etc
MISC	the em algorithm has several appealing properties
MISC	because it relies on complete data computations, it is generally simple to implement: at each iteration,  (i)  the so-called  e-step  only involves taking expectation over the conditional distribution of the latent data given the observations and  (ii)  the  m-step  is analogous to complete data weighted maximum-likelihood estimation
MISC	note that convergence to the maximum likelihood estimator cannot in general be guaranteed due to possible presence of multiple stationary points
OWNX	when processing large data sets or data streams  however, the em algorithm becomes impractical due to the requirement that the whole data be available at each iteration of the algorithm
MISC	for this reason, there has been a strong interest for online variants of the em which make it possible to estimate the parameters of a latent data model without storing the data
OWNX	in this work, we consider online algorithms for latent data models with independent observations
OWNX	the dominant approach (see also section~ below) to online em-like estimation follows the method proposed by  citation  which consists in using a  stochastic approximation algorithm, where the parameters are updated after each new observation using the gradient of the incomplete data likelihood weighted by the complete data fisher information matrix
MISC	this approach has been used, with some variations, in many different applications (see, \eg,  citation ); a proof of convergence was given by  citation
OWNX	in this contribution, we propose a new online em algorithm that sticks more closely to the principles of the original (batch-mode) em algorithm
MISC	in particular, each iteration of the proposed algorithm is decomposed into two steps, where the first one is a stochastic approximation version of the e-step aimed at incorporating the information brought by the newly available observation, and, the second step consists in the maximisation program that appears in the m-step of the traditional em algorithm
OWNX	as a consequence, and in contrast to previous work, we provide an analysis of the proposed algorithm also for the case where the observations are not assumed to follow the fitted statistical model
OWNX	the connections with other existing methods are discussed at the end of section~ and a simple example of application is described in section~
OWNX	convergence results are stated in section~, first in term of consistency (section~) and then of convergence rate (section~), with the corresponding proofs given in appendix~
OWNX	finally in section~, the performance of this approach is illustrated in the context of mixture of linear regressions
MISC	it is hard to exaggerate the role of economic aggregators --- functions that summarize numerous and / or heterogeneous data --- in economic models  since the early xx symbol  century
MISC	in many cases, as witnessed by the pioneering works of cobb and douglas, these functions were information quantities tailored to economic theories, ie they were built to fit economic phenomena
MISC	this toolbox makes it possible to find  the quality of an aggregator (for consumptions, prices, labor, capital, wages, etc ), from the standpoint  of the information it carries
OWNX	we prove a rather striking result
MISC	from the informational standpoint, well-known economic aggregators do belong to the  optimal  set
MISC	as common economic assumptions enter the analysis, this large set shrinks, and it essentially ends up  exactly fitting  either ces, or cobb-douglas, or both
MISC	to summarize, in the relevant economic contexts, one could not have crafted better some aggregator from the information standpoint
OWNX	we also discuss global economic behaviors of optimal information aggregators in general, and present a brief panorama of  the links between economic and information aggregators \\  keywords  : economic aggregators, ces, cobb-douglas, bregman divergences
MISC	since the end of the xix symbol  century and the birth of the ``neo-classical'' school,  mathematics have played a growing role in economics
MISC	with the works of l\'eon walras,  the question of aggregation of the behavior of many individuals has risen and become  central in the economic theory
MISC	in order to represent as well as possible the evolution  of these aggregate variables, some mathematical functions have been proposed and become  very famous in the economic literature
MISC	one of the most famous neo-classical function is the cobb-douglas  citation
MISC	this  function is of particular interest, since it allows for perfect substitutability between the  different inputs it depends on
MISC	another well-known ``linear'' function was later formulated  by leontief  citation , in which inputs are conversely complementary
MISC	the choice of such a function  to describe the production process has very strong implications at the macroeconomic level, as  illustrated by many results found by keynesians economics in the literature on growth theory
MISC	but beyond these different aggregate functions, one of the most recently built and well-known one is  the constant elasticity of substitution (ces) function elaborated by arrow et al citation
MISC	indeed, in the cobb-douglas production function, the elasticity of substitution of capital for  labor is fixed to unity
OWNX	on the contrary, the ces function allows this elasticity to lie between  zero and infinity, but to stay fixed at that number along and across the isoquants, whatever the  quantities of inputs that are used in the production process
MISC	the main advantage exhibited by the  ces function is that it encompasses the cobb-douglas, the leontief and the linear production  functions, which are in fact limit and thus particular cases of it
MISC	nevertheless, one of the  reasons economists have kept on using simpler functions such as the cobb-douglas one is the  heavy calculus to which the ces function often leads, especially at the point where models have to be closed
MISC	in a seminal work, douglas in  citation  highlights the importance of the progresses in the field of statistical  information in the genesis of his essay
MISC	pioneering works of cobb and douglas  citation , and arrow  et al citation , underline the inductive nature of the inception of their respective functions, as the purpose was to fit as best as possible information quantities (aggregators) to observed economic phenomena
AIMX	in this paper, we take a deductive route paved with a rigorous information material, to derive these fundamental quantities based on two assumptions:   an aggregator should always be as informative as possible with respect to the data it summarizes (prices,  consumptions, wages, capital, labor, etc );  an aggregator might be require to satisfy standard economic assumptions, relying on aggregator dualities (prices / consumptions, wages / labor, etc ), elasticities, marginal rates of substitutions, returns to scale, etc
MISC	though they were born four decades ago, it was only much later that  these distortions literally spread out to other fields, including statistics, signal processing and  classification  citation , fields where they had to become undeniably central
MISC	it was even later  that was discovered their broad applicability, with an  axiomatization that makes it possible to relate them to metrics and their spawns  citation
MISC	very roughly,  bregman divergences  are non-negative functions that meet the same identity of indiscernibles condition as metrics, and rely on a third assumption about the existence of a particular aggregator which minimizes the total distortion to a set
OWNX	this last condition, which can be rephrased as a maximum likelihood condition, makes this aggregator the  most informative   quantity about the data, and we call it a  low distortion aggregator  (lda)
OWNX	in this paper, our contribution is threefold
OWNX	first, we make a clear partition of economic aggregators with respect to information, as we show that some  are  ldas (ces, cobb-douglas), some are limit cases of ldas (leontief), and some are neither (mitscherlich-spillman-von th{\"u}nen)
OWNX	this, in fact, is our last contribution
OWNX	our main contribution is to show that, when we plug in various standard economic assumptions (see above), the set of all ldas reduces to a particular subset which  precisely  matches ces, cobb-douglas, or both sets
MISC	this novel advocacy for the use of these popular aggregators brings a very strong information-theoretic rationale to their ``economic'' existence
OWNX	section 2 presents ldas and their main properties
OWNX	in section 3, we relate common economic aggregators to ldas
OWNX	section 4 discusses additional properties of ldas
OWNX	the other modification is that we uniformly sample polynomially many samples from the (exponentially large) state space
OWNX	this way, the complexity of our algorithm becomes polynomial in the size of the fmdp description length
OWNX	we prove that the algorithm is convergent
OWNX	we also derive an upper bound on the difference between our approximate solution and the optimal one, and also on the error introduced by sampling
MISC	markov decision processes (mdps) are extremely useful for formalizing and solving sequential decision problems, with a wide repertoire of algorithms to choose from  citation
MISC	factored mdps (fmdps) may rescue us from this explosion, because they offer a more compact representation  citation
MISC	in the fmdp framework, one assumes that dependencies can be factored to several easy-to-handle components
MISC	for mdps with known parameters, there are three basic solution methods (and, naturally, countless variants of them): value iteration, policy iteration and linear programming (see the books of sutton \& barto  citation  or bertsekas \& tsitsiklis  citation  for an excellent overview)
MISC	out of these methods, linear programming is generally considered less effective than the others
OWNX	so, it comes as a surprise that all effective fmdps algorithms, to our best knowledge, use linear programming in one way or another
MISC	furthermore, the classic value iteration algorithm is known to be divergent when function approximation is used  citation , which includes the case of fmdps, too
MISC	the algorithm is a direct extension of the traditional value iteration algorithm
MISC	furthermore, it avoids computationally expensive manipulations like linear programming or the construction of decision trees
OWNX	in section  we review the basic concepts of markov decision processes, including the classical value iteration algorithm and its combination with linear function approximation
OWNX	in section  we extend the results of the previous section to fmdps and review related works in section~
OWNX	conclusions are drawn in section
OWNX	we prove that the optimal assignment kernel, proposed recently as an attempt to embed labeled graphs and more generally tuples of basic data to a hilbert space, is in fact not always positive definite
MISC	unsurprisingly, this has triggered a lot of activity focused on the design of specific positive definite kernels for specific data, such as strings and graphs for applications in bioinformatics in natural language processing  citation
MISC	motivated by applications in computational chemistry,  citation  proposed recently a kernel for labeled graphs, and more generally for structured data that can be decomposed into subparts
OWNX	however, we show below that it is in general not positive definite, which suggests that special care may be needed before using it with kernel methods
MISC	it should be pointed out that not being positive definite is not necessarily a big issue for the use of this kernel in practice
MISC	first, it may in fact be positive definite when restricted to a particular set of data used in a practical experiment
OWNX	hence our message in this note is certainly not to criticize the use of the optimal assignment kernel in the context of kernel methods
OWNX	instead we wish to warn that in some cases, negative eigenvalues may appear in the gram matrix and specific care may be needed, and simultaneously to contribute to the limitation of error propagation in the scientific litterature
MISC	kolmogorov argued that the concept of information  exists also in problems with no underlying stochastic  model (as shannon's information representation) for instance,  the information contained in an algorithm or in the genome
MISC	he introduced a combinatorial notion of entropy  and information  symbol   conveyed by a binary string   symbol  about the unknown value of a variable  symbol
MISC	is there a notion of cost of information
MISC	are there limits on how efficient   symbol  conveys information
MISC	to answer these questions kolmogorov's definition is extended and a new concept  termed  information width  which is similar to  symbol -widths in approximation theory is introduced
MISC	an application to the space of binary functions is considered
MISC	kolmogorov  citation  sought for a measure of information of  `finite objects'
MISC	in this setting,  the entropy of an object and the  information conveyed by one object about another  are well defined
MISC	here it is necessary to view an object (or a finite binary string) as a realization of a stochastic process
MISC	is it reasonable to
MISC	postulate some probability distribution for this set
MISC	these questions  led kolmogorov to  introduce an alternate  non-probabilistic and algorithmic notion  of the  information contained in a finite binary string
MISC	he defined  it as the length of the minimal-size program that can compute the string
MISC	this has been later developed into  the  so-called   kolmogorov complexity  field    citation
MISC	here  symbol  is taken to be any element in  a finite space  symbol  of objects
MISC	in  citation  he defines the `entropy' of    symbol   as  symbol  where  symbol  denotes the cardinality of  symbol  and all logarithms henceforth are taken with respect to  symbol
MISC	as he writes, if the value  of   symbol  is known to be  symbol  then this much entropy  is `eliminated' by providing  symbol  bits of `information'
MISC	let  symbol  be a general finite domain and consider a set   ar that consists of all `allowed' values of pairs  symbol
MISC	the entropy of  symbol  is defined as   symbol  where \( \pi_\by(a)  \{y\by: (x,y)a \text{ for some } x\bx\} \) denotes the projection of   symbol  on  symbol
MISC	consider the restriction of  symbol  on  symbol  based on  symbol  which is defined as  y_x =\{y\by: (x,y) a\}, \; x\in\pi_\bx(a) then the conditional combinatorial  entropy of  symbol  given  symbol  is defined as  h(\by|x) = |y_x|
OWNX	we will refer to this representation as kolmogorov's  information between  sets
MISC	clearly,  symbol
MISC	in many applications,  knowing an input  symbol   only conveys partial information about an unknown value  symbol
MISC	for instance, in  problems  which involve  the analysis of algorithms on discrete classes of structures,  such as sets of binary vectors or functions on a finite domain, an algorithmic search is made for some optimal element in this set based only on partial information
MISC	one such paradigm is the area of  statistical pattern recognition  citation   where an unknown target, i e , a pattern classifier, is seeked  based on the information contained in a finite sample and some side-information
MISC	this information is implicit in the particular set of classifiers that form  the possible hypotheses
MISC	for example, let   symbol  be a positive integer and   consider the domain  symbol
OWNX	repeating this, we have   symbol   as the collection of all properties of sets  symbol , i e , a  property  is a set whose elements are  subsets  symbol  of  symbol
OWNX	we  denote by  symbol  a property of a set  symbol  and write  symbol
OWNX	suppose that we seek to know  an unknown target function  symbol
MISC	any  partial  information about    symbol  which may be expressed by  symbol  can effectively reduce the search space
MISC	it has been a long-standing problem  to try to quantify  the value of general side-information for learning (see  citation  and references therein)
OWNX	we assert  that kolmogorov's combinatorial framework may serve as a basis
MISC	however,  its current form ()   is not general enough since it requires that the target  symbol  be restricted to a fixed set  symbol  on knowledge of   symbol
MISC	consider the collection  symbol  of all subsets  symbol  that have this property
MISC	suppose that most of the sets  symbol ,  symbol  are small while the sets  symbol ,  symbol  are large
MISC	if, as above, we let  symbol  and  symbol  then we have   symbol  which wrongly implies that both properties are equally informative
MISC	knowing   symbol  provides implicit information associated with  the collection of possible sets  symbol ,   symbol
MISC	this implicit structural information  cannot be represented in  ()
MISC	0 3cm consider a class  symbol  of  binary functions  symbol   on a finite interval  symbol
MISC	define the  sample width  of  symbol   on a finite subset (a sample)  symbol  as \( \w_s(h) \min_{xs} |\w_h(x)| \) where  symbol
MISC	for any fixed width parameter  symbol   define the  hyperclass   symbol } in words,  symbol  consists of all  sets of subsets  symbol  of cardinality  symbol   on which the corresponding binary functions  symbol  are wide by at least  symbol
MISC	since the domain  symbol  is infinite then so is  symbol  hence one cannot simply measure its cardinality
OWNX	instead  we  apply a standard combinatorial measure of the complexity of a family of sets as follows: suppose  symbol  is  a general domain and  symbol  is  an infinite  class of subsets of  symbol
MISC	the   growth function   (see for instance  citation )  is defined as  symbol  it measures the rate in which the number of dichotomies obtained by intersecting subsets  symbol  of  symbol  with a finite set  symbol   increases as a function of the cardinality  symbol  of  symbol  in the maximal case (it is  also called the trace of  symbol  in  citation )
OWNX	we study the case assuming that bits are independently distributed  across  symbol  dimensions
MISC	the function computes a maximum-weight balanced cut of  symbol ,  where the weight of a cut is the sum of the weights across all edges in the cut
OWNX	we explore a type of classification problem that arises in the context of computational biology
MISC	features have slightly different frequencies depending on which population the  individual belongs to, and are assumed to be independent of each other
AIMX	given the population of origin of an individual, the genotype (represented as a bit vector in this paper) can be reasonably assumed to be generated by drawing  alleles independently from the appropriate distribution
OWNX	we describe  symbol  and  symbol  as a function of the ``average quality''   symbol  of the features
OWNX	the same model was previously used  in~ citation  and ~ citation  {statistical model:} we have   symbol  probability spaces  symbol  over the set  symbol
MISC	further, the components ( features ) of  symbol  are independent and  symbol   ( symbol ,  symbol )
MISC	moreover, the input of the algorithm consists of  a collection ( mixture ) of  symbol  unlabeled samples,  symbol  points  from  symbol , and the algorithm is to determine for each data point from which of  symbol  it was chosen
MISC	an important parameter of the probability ensemble  symbol  is the  measure of divergence   between any two distributions
MISC	variants of the above theorem, based on a model that allows two random draws at each dimension for all points, are given in~ citation  and ~ citation
MISC	the cleverness there is the construction of a diploid score at each dimension,  given any  pair of individuals , under the assumption that two random bits can be  drawn from the same distribution at each dimension
CONT	in addition,~ citation  shows that when  symbol ,  given two bits from each dimension, one can always classify for any size of  symbol ,  for unbalanced cases with any number of mixtures, using essentially connected  component based algorithms, given the weighted graph as in described in  theorem~
AIMX	the key contribution of this paper is to show new ideas that we use to  accomplish the goal of clustering with the same amount of features,  while requiring only one random bit at each dimension
MISC	finding a max-cut is computationally intractable;  a hill-climbing algorithm was given in~ citation  to partition a balanced  mixture, with a stronger requirement on  symbol , given any  symbol ,  as the middle green curve in figure~ shows
MISC	both spectral algorithms in~ citation  achieve the bound established by theorem~ without requiring the input instances being balanced, and work for cases when  symbol  is a constant; however, they require  symbol , even when  symbol  and the input instance  is balanced, as the vertical line in figure~ shows
OWNX	note that when  symbol , i e , when we have enough sample from  each distribution,  symbol  becomes the only requirement  in theorem~
MISC	exploring the tradeoffs between  symbol  and  symbol , when  symbol  is small, as in  theorem~ in algorithmic design is both of  theoretical interests and practical value }                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           long-lemma
MISC	optimal decision thresholds for the multi-armed bandit problem, one for the infinite horizon discounted reward case and one for the finite horizon undiscounted reward case are derived, which make the link between the reward horizon, uncertainty and the need for exploration explicit
MISC	in reinforcement learning, the dilemma between selecting actions to maximise the expected return according to the current world model and to improve the world model such as to  potentially  be able to achieve a higher expected return is referred to as the  exploration-exploitation trade-off
MISC	this has been the subject of much interest before, one of the earliest developments being the theory of sequential sampling in statistics, as developed by  citation
MISC	this dealt mostly with making sequential decisions for accepting one among a set of particular hypothesis, with a view towards applying it to jointly decide the termination of an experiment and the acceptance of a hypothesis
MISC	a more general overview of sequential decision problems from a bayesian viewpoint is offered in  citation
MISC	the optimal, but intractable, bayesian solution for bandit problems was given in~ citation , while recently tight bounds on the sample complexity of exploration have been found  citation
OWNX	the following section formulates the intuitive concept of trading exploration and exploitation as a natural consequence of the  definition  of the problem of reinforcement learning
OWNX	derives a threshold for switching from exploratory to greedy behaviour in bandit problems
OWNX	this threshold is found to depend on the effective reward horizon of the optimal policy and on our current belief distribution of the expected rewards of each action
MISC	a sketch of the extension to mdps is presented in sec ~
OWNX	we conclude with a discussion on the relations with other methods
OWNX	we propose a novel model for nonlinear dimension reduction motivated by the probabilistic formulation of principal component analysis
MISC	nonlinearity is achieved by specifying different transformation matrices at different locations of the latent space and smoothing the transformation using a markov random field type prior
MISC	the computation is made feasible by the recent advances in sampling from von mises-fisher distributions
OWNX	it is often used for exploratory data analysis with the objective of understanding the structure of the data
MISC	pca aims to represent the high dimensional data points with low-dimensional representers commonly called latent variables, which can be used for visualization, data compression etc
MISC	sometimes pca is also used as a preprocessing step before regression  citation  or clustering  citation
MISC	in these context, however, pca typically does not have satisfying performance due to the ignorance of subsequent analysis
OWNX	we denote the original high dimensional data by  symbol , where  symbol
OWNX	we assume the data are already centered so that  symbol
MISC	one common definition of pca is that of taking a linear combination of the components of  symbol :  symbol  where  symbol  is the weighting coefficient of the  symbol -th covariate
MISC	this can be written as   symbol } where  symbol
OWNX	we take  symbol  so that () represents a projection onto the linear subspace spanned by  symbol
OWNX	we want  symbol  to be a good representation of the original  symbol
OWNX	thus we aim to minimize  symbol
MISC	it can be shown that the minimizing  symbol  is the eigenvector of  symbol  associated with its largest eigenvalue, called the first principal component and denoted by  symbol
MISC	pca is a linear procedure since the reconstruction is based on a linear combination of the principal components
MISC	several nonlinear extensions have been proposed
MISC	the most famous one in the statistical literature is the principal curves proposed in  citation
MISC	the principal curve is defined as the curve such that each point on the curve is the center of all the data points whose projection onto the curve is that point
MISC	thus visually the principal curve is defined as the curve that passes through the ``middle" of the data points
MISC	although conceptually appealing, the computational constraint makes it difficult to extend this approach to higher dimensions
MISC	other approaches including neural networks  citation , kernel embedding  citation , and generative topographic mapping  citation  have been proposed
OWNX	the advantage of probabilistic modeling is multifold, including providing a mechanism for density modeling, determination of degree of novelty of a new data point, and naturally incorporating incomplete observations
MISC	in  citation , the generative model is defined through the observation equation:  symbol } which stated the linear relationship between the latent variable and the data points,  symbol  is a  symbol  matrix that is not constrained to have orthogonal columns a priori, and  symbol  are  iid 
MISC	noises with  symbol
OWNX	note we assume that the data is already centered, otherwise the observation model should be changed to  symbol  with shift parameter  symbol
OWNX	in ppca, we put a zero mean, unit covariance gaussian prior on  symbol , and the likelihood is maximized over  symbol  after marginalizing over  symbol :  symbol   it is shown that when the noise level  symbol  goes to zero, the maximum likelihood estimator for  symbol  will converge to   symbol } where the matrix  symbol  and  symbol  comes from singular value decomposition of  symbol
MISC	thus ppca is a natural extension of the traditional pca
MISC	citation  extends ppca to mixture ppca which can be used to model nonlinear structure in the data
OWNX	in ppca, after marginalizing over  symbol , the distribution of  symbol  becomes  symbol  if the data are not centered
MISC	the mixture ppca models the marginal distribution of  symbol  as   symbol  a mixture with  symbol  components, and for each component, the observation model is  symbol  if the  symbol -th observation comes from the  symbol -th mixture component
MISC	thus in mixture ppca, each mixture component is defined by a different linear transformation, while clustering is defined on the original  symbol dimensional space
MISC	the maximization over  symbol  and  symbol  can be performed using em algorithm taking the mixture indicators as the missing data
MISC	the experiments in  citation  showed that this model has a wide applicability
MISC	this piece of information cannot be recovered from the latent variable  symbol  alone
OWNX	another approach of probabilistic nonlinear pca based on gaussian processes has been proposed in  citation
MISC	it starts from the same observation model (), but instead of marginalizing over  symbol , it marginalizes over  symbol  by putting independent spherical gaussian prior on the  symbol  columns of  symbol , resulting in the marginal distribution of  symbol , where  symbol  is the  symbol -th column of  symbol  and  symbol  is the  symbol  matrix of latent variables
MISC	first, the linear transformation is defined through the orthonormal matrix  symbol  instead of  symbol  which roughly corresponds to  symbol  in ppca
MISC	the model is estimated by gibbs sampling which explores the posterior distribution of both the latent space and the transformation space
MISC	the computational burden for each iteration of gibbs sampling is square in the number of data points
OWNX	since we think the readers might not be familiar with the von mises-fisher distribution, some background material is also provided
OWNX	some experiments are carried out in section 3 using both simulated manifold data and the handwritten digits data
OWNX	we present a general approach for collaborative filtering (cf) using spectral regularization to learn linear operators from ``users'' to a set of possibly desired ``objects''
MISC	recent low-rank type matrix completion approaches to cf are shown to be special cases
OWNX	however, unlike existing regularization based cf methods, our approach can be used to also incorporate information such as attributes of the users or the objects---a limitation of existing regularization based cf methods
OWNX	we provide novel representer theorems that we use to develop new estimation methods
OWNX	we then provide learning algorithms based on low-rank decompositions, and test them on a standard cf dataset
MISC	the experiments indicate the advantages of generalizing the existing regularization based cf methods to incorporate related information about users and objects
OWNX	finally, we show that certain multi-task learning methods can be also seen as special cases of our proposed approach
MISC	collaborative filtering (cf) refers to the task of predicting preferences of a given ``user'' for some ``objects'' (e g , books, music, products, people, etc ) based on his/her previously revealed preferences---typically in the form of purchases or ratings---as well as the revealed preferences of other users
MISC	in a book recommender system, for example, one would like to suggest new books to someone based on what she and other users have recently purchased or rated
MISC	a number of cf methods have been developed in the past  citation
MISC	recently there has been interest in cf using regularization based methods  citation
MISC	recent regularization based cf methods assume that the only data available are the revealed preferences, where no other information such as background information on the objects or users is given
MISC	when the only information available is a set of observed user/object ratings, the unknown entries in the matrix must be inferred from the known ones -- of which there are typically very few relative to the size of the matrix
MISC	the most common assumption is that preferences can be decomposed into a small number of factors, both for users and objects, resulting in the search for a low-rank matrix which approximates the partially observed matrix of preferences  citation
MISC	since the rank constraint gives rise to a non-convex set of matrices, the associated optimization problem will be a difficult non-convex problem for which only heuristic algorithms exist  citation
MISC	an alternative formulation, proposed by~ citation , suggests penalizing the predicted matrix by its  trace norm , i e , the sum of its singular values
MISC	however, a key limitation of current regularization based cf methods is that they do not take advantage of information, such as attributes of users (e g , gender, age) or objects (e g , book's author, genre), which is often available
MISC	intuitively, such information might be useful to guide the inference of preferences, in particular for users and objects with very few known ratings
MISC	for example, at the extreme, users and objects with no prior ratings can not be considered in the standard cf formulation, while their attributes alone could provide some basic preference inference
OWNX	more precisely we show that cf, while typically seen as a problem of matrix completion, can be thought of more generally as estimating a linear operator from the space of users to the space of objects
OWNX	we then develop  spectral regularization  based methods to learn such linear operators
MISC	when dealing with operators, rather than matrices, one may also work with infinite dimension, allowing one to consider arbitrary feature space, possibly induced by some kernel function
OWNX	we also show that, with the appropriate choice of kernels for both users and objects, we may consider a number of existing machine learning methods as special cases of our general framework
OWNX	in particular, we show that several cf methods such as rank constrained optimization, trace-norm regularization, and those based on frobenius norm regularization, can all be cast as special cases of spectral regularization on operator spaces
MISC	moreover, particular choices of kernels lead to specific sub-cases such as regular matrix completion and multitask learning
OWNX	in the specific application of collaborative filtering with the presence of attributes, we show that our generalization of these sub-cases leads to better predictive performance
OWNX	in section~, we review the notion of a compact operator on hilbert space, and we show how to cast the collaborative filtering problem within this framework
OWNX	we then introduce spectral regularization and discuss how rank constraint, trace norm regularization, and frobenius norm regularization are all special cases of spectral regularization
OWNX	in section~, we show how our general framework encompasses many existing methods by proper choices of the loss function, the kernels, and the spectral regularizer
OWNX	in section~, we provide three representer theorems for operator estimation with spectral regularization which allow for efficient learning algorithms
OWNX	finally in section~ we present a number of algorithms and describe several techniques to improve efficiency
OWNX	we test these algorithms in section~ on synthetic examples and a widely used movie database
OWNX	we also describe two new models: the switch distribution, which was recently developed to improve bayesian/minimum description length model selection, and a new generalisation of the fixed share algorithm based on run-length coding
OWNX	we give loss bounds for all models and shed new light on their relationships
MISC	nevertheless, people do make weather forecasts and buy shares all the time
MISC	such predictions can be based on formal models, or on human expertise or intuition
MISC	an investment company may even want to choose between portfolios on the basis of a combination of these kinds of predictors
MISC	we address the question how a given set of experts can be combined into a single predictive strategy that is as good as, or if possible even better than, the best individual expert
MISC	let  symbol  be a finite set of experts
MISC	each expert  symbol  issues a distribution  symbol  on the next outcome  symbol  given the previous observations  symbol
MISC	here, each outcome  symbol  is an element of some countable space  symbol , and random variables are written in bold face
MISC	the probability that an expert assigns to a sequence of outcomes is given by the chain rule:  symbol
MISC	a standard bayesian approach to combine the expert predictions is to define a prior  symbol  on the experts  symbol  which induces a joint distribution with mass function  symbol
MISC	inference is then based on this joint distribution
MISC	additionally, this bayesian strategy guarantees that the overall probability of the data is only a factor  symbol  smaller than the probability of the data according to the best available expert  symbol
OWNX	in the latter the experts' predictions are not necessarily probabilistic, and scored using an arbitrary loss function
OWNX	we introduce hmms as an intuitive graphical language that allows unified description of existing and new models
MISC	additionally, the running time for evaluation of such models can be read off directly from the size of their representation
MISC	counting  is a fundamental operation
MISC	for example,  counting the  symbol th frequency moment,   symbol , of a streaming signal  symbol  (where  symbol  denotes time), has been an active area of research, in theoretical computer science, databases, and data mining
MISC	when  symbol , the task (i e , counting the sum) can be accomplished using a  counter
MISC	compressed counting (cc)  is proposed for efficiently  computing the  symbol th frequency moment of a data stream   symbol , where  symbol
MISC	for  data streams  in practice, this restriction is  minor
OWNX	we show the sample complexity (number of projections) {symbol }, where {symbol } as  {symbol }
MISC	in other words, for small  symbol ,  symbol  instead of  symbol
MISC	the case  symbol  is practically very important
MISC	it is now well-understood that one can obtain good approximations to the entropies of data streams using the  symbol th moments with  symbol  and very small  symbol
MISC	as another example,  symbol  might be the ``decay rate'' or ``interest rate,'' which is usually small
MISC	thus,  compressed counting  will be an ideal tool, for estimating the total value in the future, taking in account the effect of decaying or interest accruement
OWNX	finally, our another contribution is an algorithm for approximating the logarithmic norm, {symbol }, and the logarithmic distance, {symbol }
MISC	the logarithmic norm arises in  statistical estimations
MISC	the logarithmic distance is  useful in machine learning practice with heavy-tailed data
MISC	computing the sum {symbol } is the simplest counting ( symbol  denotes time)
MISC	counting the {symbol th moment  symbol } is more general
MISC	when {symbol ,  symbol } counts the total number of non-zeros in  symbol
MISC	if   symbol  actually outputs the power of an underlying signal  symbol , counting the sum {symbol } is equivalent to computing {symbol }
MISC	here,  symbol  denotes a time-varying signal, for example,   data streams  citation
MISC	in the literature, the  symbol th frequency moment of a data stream  symbol  is defined as {}  counting  symbol  for massive data streams is practically important, among many  challenging issues in data stream computations
MISC	in fact, the general theme of ``scaling up for high dimensional data and high speed data streams'' is among the  ``ten challenging problems in data mining research
MISC	''%}  because the elements,  symbol , are time-varying,  a na\'ive counting mechanism requires a system of  symbol  counters to compute  symbol  exactly
OWNX	this is not always realistic when  symbol  is large and we only need an approximate answer
MISC	for example,  symbol  may be   symbol  if  symbol  records the arrivals of ip addresses
MISC	compressed counting (cc)  is a new scheme for approximating the  symbol th frequency moments of data streams (where  symbol ) using low memory
OWNX	the underlying technique is based on what we call  skewed stable random projections
OWNX	we consider the framework of stochastic multi-armed bandit problems and study the possibilities
MISC	these forecasters are assessed in terms of their simple regret, a regret
MISC	 notion that captures the fact that exploration is only constrained by the number
MISC	 of available rounds (not necessarily known in advance), in contrast to the case when the cumulative
MISC	 regret is considered and when exploitation needs to be performed at the same time
OWNX	we
MISC	 believe that this performance criterion is suited to situations when
MISC	 the cost of pulling an arm is expressed in terms of resources rather than rewards
OWNX	we discuss the links between the simple and the cumulative regret
MISC	 is a general lower bound on the simple regret of a forecaster in terms of its
MISC	 cumulative regret: the smaller the latter, the larger the former
OWNX	 we then exhibit upper bounds on the simple regret of some forecasters
OWNX	 we show that the simple regret can be minimized with respect to a family of probability
MISC	 distributions if and only if the cumulative regret
MISC	 can be minimized for it
OWNX	based on this equivalence, we are able to prove that the separable metric spaces
MISC	 these regrets can be minimized
MISC	 with respect to the family of all probability distributions with continuous mean-payoff functions
MISC	learning processes usually face an exploration versus exploitation
MISC	 dilemma, since they have to get information on the environment (exploration)
MISC	 to be able to take good actions (exploitation)
MISC	a key example is
MISC	 the multi-armed bandit problem  citation , a sequential decision
MISC	 problem where, at each stage, the forecaster has to pull one out of
MISC	  symbol  given stochastic arms and gets a reward drawn at random
MISC	 according to the distribution of the chosen arm
MISC	the usual assessment criterion of a forecaster is given by its cumulative regret,
MISC	 the sum of differences between the expected reward of the best arm and the obtained rewards
OWNX	our setting is as follows
MISC	the forecaster may sample the arms a given number of times  symbol  (not necessarily known
MISC	 in advance) and is then asked to output a recommended arm
MISC	 average payoff of the best arm and the average payoff obtained by his recommendation
OWNX	we now illustrate why this is a natural framework for numerous applications
MISC	in the case of a severe disease, ill patients only are included in the trial
MISC	 and the cost of picking the wrong treatment
MISC	 is high (the associated reward would equal a large negative value)
MISC	it is important to minimize the cumulative regret, since the test
MISC	 and cure phases coincide
MISC	however, for cosmetic products, there exists a test phase separated from
MISC	 skin moisturization, is performed )
MISC	  \medskip
MISC	 the pure exploration problem addresses the design of strategies making the best possible use of available numerical
MISC	 resources (e g , as {cpu} time) in order to optimize the performance of some decision-making task
MISC	that is, it occurs in situations with a preliminary exploration phase
MISC	 in which costs are not measured in terms of rewards but rather in terms of resources, that come in limited budget
MISC	a motivating example concerns recent works on computer-go (e g , the mogo program  citation )
MISC	a given time, i e , a given amount of {cpu} times is given to the player
MISC	 the {uct} strategy  citation  and the {bast} strategy  citation
MISC	however, the cumulative regret does not seem to be the right
OWNX	 way to base the strategies on, since the simulation costs are the same for exploring all
MISC	 options, bad and good ones
OWNX	 was actually the starting point of the notion of simple regret and of this work
MISC	a final related example is the maximization of some function  symbol , observed with noise, see, eg ,  citation
MISC	 the issue is to choose as adequately as possible where to query the value of this function
MISC	 in order to have a good approximation to the maximum
MISC	the pure exploration problem considered here addresses exactly the design of adaptive exploration strategies
MISC	 making the best use of available resources in order to make the most precise prediction
MISC	 once all resources are consumed
MISC	as a remark, it also turns out that in all examples considered above,
MISC	 the amount of available resources (time, budget, or the number of patients to be included)~--
OWNX	 that is, we seek for anytime performance \medskip
MISC	 the problem of pure exploration presented above was referred to as ``budgeted multi-armed bandit problem'' in
MISC	 the open problem  citation  (where, however, another notion of regret than simple regret is considered)
MISC	 only and rewards given by probability distributions over  symbol  in  citation
MISC	a related setting is considered in  citation  and  citation , where
MISC	 forecasters perform exploration during a random number of
MISC	 rounds  symbol  and aim at identifying an  symbol --best arm
MISC	another related problem is the identification of the best arm (with high probability)
MISC	however, this binary assessment criterion (the forecaster is either right or wrong
MISC	learning problems form an important category of computational tasks that generalizes many of the computations researchers apply to large real-life data sets
OWNX	more precisely, we investigate  learning algorithms that satisfy  differential privacy , a notion that provides strong confidentiality guarantees in contexts where aggregate information is released about a database containing sensitive information about individuals \ifnum\full=0 we present several basic results that demonstrate general feasibility of private learning and relate several models previously studied separately in the contexts of privacy and standard learning
MISC	therefore, almost anything learnable is learnable privately: specifically, if a concept class is learnable by a (non-private) algorithm with polynomial sample complexity and output size, then it can be learned privately using a polynomial number of samples
OWNX	we also present a computationally efficient private pac learner for the class of  parity  functions
MISC	this result dispels the similarity between learning with noise and private learning (both must be robust to small changes in inputs), since parity is thought to be very hard to learn given random classification noise
MISC	local  (or  randomized response ) algorithms are a practical class of private algorithms that have received extensive investigation
OWNX	we provide a precise characterization of local private learning algorithms
MISC	therefore, for local private learning algorithms, the similarity to learning with noise is stronger: local learning is equivalent to sq learning, and sq algorithms include most known noise-tolerant learning algorithms
OWNX	finally, we present a separation between the power of  interactive  and  noninteractive  local learning algorithms
MISC	the data privacy problem in modern databases is similar to that faced by  statistical agencies and medical researchers: to learn and publish global analyses of a population while maintaining the confidentiality of the participants in a survey
MISC	there is a vast body of work on this problem in statistics and computer science
MISC	however, until recently, most schemes proposed in the literature lacked rigorous analysis of privacy and utility
MISC	the notion of  differential privacy ~ citation  that emerged from this line of work provides rigorous guarantees even in the presence of a malicious adversary with access to  arbitrary auxiliary information
MISC	it requires that whether an individual supplies her actual or fake information has almost no effect on the outcome of the analysis
MISC	given this definition, it is natural to ask: what computational tasks can be performed while maintaining privacy
MISC	research on data privacy, to the extent that it formalizes precise goals,  has mostly focused on  function evaluation  (``what is the value of  symbol
MISC	''), namely, how much privacy is possible if one wishes to release (an approximation to) a particular function  symbol , evaluated on the database  symbol  (a notable exception is the recent work of mcsherry and talwar, using differential privacy in the design of auction mechanisms~ citation )
MISC	informally, a concept is a function from examples to labels, and a class of concepts is learnable if for any distribution  symbol  on examples, one can, given limited access to examples sampled from  symbol  labeled according to some target concept  symbol , find a small circuit (hypothesis) which predicts  symbol 's labels with high probability over future examples taken from the same distribution
MISC	in the pac model, a learning algorithm can access a polynomial number of labeled examples
MISC	in the sq model, instead of accessing examples directly, the learner can specify some properties (i e , predicates) on the examples, for which he is given an estimate, up to an additive polynomially small error, of the probability that a random example chosen from  symbol  satisfies the property
MISC	this is exactly how (not necessarily private) learners are analyzed
MISC	for instance, an example might consist of an individual's gender, age, and blood pressure history, and the label, whether this individual has had a heart attack
MISC	the algorithm has to learn to predict whether an individual has had a heart attack, based on gender, age, and blood pressure history, generated according to  symbol
MISC	in the scenario above, it translates to not revealing each participant's gender, age, blood pressure history, and heart attack incidence
MISC	more precisely, the output of a private learner should not be significantly affected if a particular example  symbol  is replaced with arbitrary  symbol , for all  symbol  and  symbol
OWNX	hence, when we analyze the privacy of our learners we do not make any assumptions on the underlying distribution
OWNX	%shiva-explain this point in the full version
OWNX	we consider regularized support vector machines (svms) and show that they are precisely equivalent to a new robust optimization formulation
OWNX	we show that this equivalence of robust optimization and regularization has implications for both algorithms, and analysis
MISC	on the analysis front, the equivalence of robustness and regularization,  provides a robust optimization interpretation for the success of regularized svms
OWNX	we use the this new robustness interpretation of svms to give a new proof of consistency of (kernelized) svms, thus establishing robustness as the  reason  regularized svms generalize well
MISC	support vector machines (svms for short) originated in  citation  and can be traced back to as early as  citation  and  citation
MISC	they continue to be one of the most successful algorithms for classification
MISC	when the samples are not separable, a penalty term that approximates the total training error is considered  citation
MISC	it is well known that minimizing the training error itself can lead to poor classification performance for new unlabeled data; that is, such an approach may have poor generalization error because of, essentially, overfitting  citation
MISC	a variety of modifications have been proposed to combat this problem, one of the most popular methods being that of minimizing a combination of the training-error and a regularization term
MISC	the latter is typically chosen as a norm of the classifier
MISC	the resulting regularized classifier  performs better on new data
MISC	this phenomenon is often interpreted from a statistical learning theory view: the regularization term restricts the complexity of the classifier, hence the deviation of the testing error and the training error is controlled  citation
MISC	the use of robust optimization in classification is not new  citation
MISC	robust classification models studied in the past have considered only box-type uncertainty sets, which allow the possibility that the data have all been skewed in some non-neutral manner by a correlated disturbance
MISC	this has made it difficult to obtain non-conservative generalization bounds
MISC	moreover, there has not been an explicit connection to the regularized classifier, although at a high-level it is known that regularization and robust optimization are related  citation
OWNX	in particular, our contributions include the following:   we solve the robust svm formulation for a class of non-box-type uncertainty sets
MISC	this permits finer control of the adversarial disturbance, restricting it to satisfy aggregate constraints across data points, therefore reducing the possibility of highly correlated disturbance
OWNX	we show that the standard regularized svm classifier is a special case of our robust classification, thus explicitly relating robustness and regularization
MISC	this provides an alternative explanation to the success of regularization, and also suggests new physically motivated ways to construct regularization terms
OWNX	we relate our robust formulation to several probabilistic formulations
OWNX	we consider a chance-constrained  classifier (i e , a classifier with probabilistic constraints on misclassification) and show that our robust formulation can approximate it far less conservatively than previous robust formulations could possibly do
OWNX	we show that the robustness perspective, stemming from a non- iid 
OWNX	we briefly explain how this observation is different from previous work and why it is interesting
MISC	certain equivalence relationships between robustness and regularization have been established for problems other than classification  citation , but their results do not directly apply to the classification problem
MISC	indeed, research on classifier regularization mainly discusses its effect on bounding the complexity of the function class  citation
MISC	meanwhile, research on robust classification has not attempted to relate robustness and regularization  citation , in part due to the robustness formulations used in those papers
MISC	in fact, they all consider robustified versions of  regularized  classifications
MISC	citation  considers a robust formulation for box-type uncertainty, and relates this robust formulation with regularized svm
MISC	however, this formulation involves a non-standard loss function that does not bound the  symbol  loss, and hence its physical interpretation is not clear
OWNX	in contrast to the standard pac approach, this bound depends neither on how rich the class of candidate classifiers is, nor on an assumption that all samples are picked in an  iid 
MISC	manner
MISC	this complexity term typically leads to overly emphasizing the regularizer, and indeed this approach is known to often be too pessimistic~ citation  for problems with more structure
MISC	the robust approach offers another avenue
MISC	for example, it is known that normalizing the samples so that the variance among all features is roughly the same (a process commonly used to eliminate the scaling freedom of individual features) often leads to good generalization performance
OWNX	we also show that using the robust optimization viewpoint, we obtain some probabilistic results outside the pac setup
OWNX	in section~ we bound the probability that a noisy training sample is correctly labeled
MISC	this is helpful when the training samples and the testing samples are drawn from different distributions, or some adversary manipulates the samples to prevent them from being correctly labeled (e g , spam senders change their patterns from time to time to avoid being labeled and filtered)
OWNX	finally, this connection of robustification and regularization also provides us with new proof techniques as well (see section~)
MISC	an alternative interpretation of robustness stems from the rich literature on robust statistics  citation , which studies how an estimator or algorithm behaves under a small perturbation of the statistics model
MISC	for example, the influence function approach, proposed in  citation  and  citation , measures the impact  of an infinitesimal amount of contamination of the original distribution on the quantity of interest
MISC	in the machine learning literature, another widely used notion closely related to robustness is the  stability , where an algorithm is required to be robust (in the sense that the output function does not change significantly) under a specific perturbation: deleting one sample from the training set
MISC	one main difference between robust optimization and other robustness notions is that the former is constructive rather than analytical
OWNX	in section~ we  investigate the correlated disturbance case, and  show the equivalence between the robust classification and the regularization process
OWNX	we develop the connections to probabilistic formulations in section~, and prove a consistency result based on robustness analysis in section~
OWNX	the kernelized version is investigated in section~
OWNX	some concluding remarks are given in section~ {notation:} capital letters are used to denote matrices, and boldface letters are used to denote column vectors
OWNX	we use  symbol  to denote disturbance affecting the samples
MISC	the set of non-negative scalars is denoted by  symbol
MISC	the set of integers from  symbol  to  symbol  is denoted by  symbol
OWNX	we propose a method for support vector machine classification using indefinite kernels
OWNX	instead of directly minimizing or stabilizing a nonconvex loss function, our algorithm simultaneously computes support vectors and a proxy kernel matrix used in forming the loss
MISC	this can be interpreted as a penalized kernel learning problem where indefinite kernel matrices are treated as noisy observations of a true mercer kernel
OWNX	we compare the performance of our technique with other methods on several standard data sets
OWNX	the classification problem then becomes a linearly constrained quadratic program
OWNX	here, we present an algorithm for svm classification using indefinite kernels}, i e kernel matrices formed using similarity measures which are not positive semidefinite
MISC	first, certain similarity measures take advantage of application-specific structure in the data and often display excellent empirical classification performance
MISC	similarity measures for protein sequences such as the smith-waterman and blast scores are indefinite yet have provided hints for constructing useful positive semidefinite kernels such as those decribed in  citation  or have been transformed into positive semidefinite kernels with good empirical performance (see  citation , for example)
OWNX	in both cases, our method allows us to bypass these limitations
OWNX	our objective here is to derive efficient algorithms to directly use these indefinite similarity measures for classification
OWNX	our work closely follows, in spirit, recent results on kernel learning (see  citation  or  citation ), where the kernel matrix is learned as a linear combination of given kernels, and the result is explicitly constrained to be positive semidefinite
OWNX	we consider the least-square linear regression problem with regularization by the  symbol -norm, a problem usually referred to as the lasso
OWNX	for various decays of the regularization parameter, we compute asymptotic equivalents of the probability of correct model selection (i e , variable selection)
MISC	in the context of least-square linear regression, the problem is usually referred to as the  lasso ~ citation
MISC	much of the early effort has been dedicated to algorithms to solve the optimization problem efficiently
MISC	moreover, a well-known justification of the  regularization by the  symbol -norm is that it leads to  sparse  solutions, i e , loading vectors with many zeros, and thus performs model selection
MISC	in particular, in low correlation settings, the lasso is indeed consistent
MISC	however, in presence of strong correlations, the lasso cannot be consistent, shedding light on potential problems of such procedures for variable selection
MISC	adaptive versions where data-dependent weights are added to the  symbol -norm  then allow to keep the consistency in all situations~ citation
OWNX	if several datasets generated from the same distribution were available, then the latter property  would suggest to consider the intersection of the supports of the lasso estimates for each dataset: all relevant variables would always be selected for all datasets, while irrelevant variables would enter the models randomly, and intersecting the supports from sufficiently many different datasets would simply eliminate them
MISC	however, in practice, only one dataset is given; but resampling methods such as the  bootstrap  are exactly dedicated to mimic the availability of several datasets by resampling from the same unique dataset~ citation
OWNX	finally, our bolasso framework could be seen as a voting scheme applied to the supports of the bootstrap lasso estimates; however, our procedure may rather be considered as a consensus combination scheme, as we keep the (largest) subset of variables on which  all  regressors agree in terms of variable selection, which is in our case provably consistent and also allows to get rid of a potential additional hyperparameter
OWNX	sketches of proofs can be found in appendix~a \paragraph{notations} for a vector  symbol , we let denote  symbol  the  symbol -norm,  symbol  the  symbol -norm and  symbol  the  symbol -norm
MISC	for    symbol ,  symbol  denotes the sign of  symbol , defined as  symbol  if  symbol ,  symbol  if  symbol , and  symbol  if  symbol
MISC	for a vector  symbol ,  symbol  denotes the the vector of signs of elements of  symbol
MISC	moreover, given a vector  symbol  and a subset  symbol  of  symbol ,  symbol  denotes the vector in  symbol  of elements of  symbol  indexed by  symbol
MISC	similarly, for a matrix  symbol ,  symbol  denotes the submatrix of   symbol  composed of elements of  symbol  whose rows are in  symbol  and columns are in  symbol
MISC	firstly, three popular learners, namely, ``neighborhood component analysis'', ``large margin nearest neighbors'' and ``discriminant neighborhood embedding'', which do not have kernel versions are kernelized in order to improve their classification performances
MISC	thirdly, while the truths of representer theorems are just assumptions in previous papers related to ours, here, representer theorems are formally proven
MISC	recently, many mahalanobis distance learners are invented \shortcite{chen:cvpr05,goldberger:nips05,weinberger:nips06,yang:aaai06,sugiyama:icml06,yan:pami07,wei:icml07,torresani:nips07,xing:nips03}
MISC	these recently proposed learners are carefully designed so that they can handle a class of problems where data of one class form multi-modality where classical learners such as principal component analysis (pca) and fisher discriminant analysis (fda) cannot handle
MISC	therefore, promisingly, the new learners usually outperform the classical learners on experiments reported in recent papers
MISC	nevertheless, since learning a mahalanobis distance is equivalent to learning a linear map, the inability to learn a non-linear transformation is one important limitation of all mahalanobis distance learners
MISC	symbol  a  kpca trick  framework is presented as an alternative choice to the kernel-trick framework
OWNX	our theorems justify both the kernel-trick and the kpca-trick frameworks
OWNX	firstly, we investigate the  kernel alignment  method proposed in previous works \shortcite{lanckriet:jmlr04,zhu:nips05} to see whether it is appropriate for a kernelized mahalanobis distance learner or not
OWNX	secondly, we investigate a simple method which constructs an unweighted combination of base kernels
OWNX	kernel constructions based on our two approaches require much shorter running time when comparing to the standard cross validation approach
OWNX	we provide an explanation and conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to prove the usefulness of the kernelization
OWNX	we present a novel approach to semi-supervised learning  which is based on statistical physics
OWNX	in contrast to these methods, we estimate the  distribution  of classifications, instead of the sole minimal k-way cut, which yields more accurate and robust results
OWNX	our approach may be applied to all energy functions used for semi-supervised learning
OWNX	the method is based on sampling using a multicanonical markov chain monte-carlo algorithm, and has a straightforward probabilistic interpretation, which allows for soft assignments of points to classes, and also to cope with yet unseen class types
MISC	situations in which  many unlabelled points are available  and  only few labelled points are provided call for semi-supervised learning methods
MISC	such problems occur in many fields, in which obtaining data is cheap but labelling is expensive
MISC	the basic assumption of unsupervised learning, i e clustering, is that points which belong to the same cluster actually originate from the same class
MISC	clustering methods which are based on estimating the density of data points define a cluster as a `mode' in the distribution, i e a relatively dense region surrounded by  relatively lower density
MISC	hence each mode is assumed to originate from a single class, although a certain class may be dispersed over several modes
MISC	in case the modes are well separated  they can be easily identified by unsupervised techniques, and there is no need for semi-supervised methods
MISC	in this case density based unsupervised methods may encounter difficulties in distinguishing between  the modes (classes), while semi-supervised methods can be of help
MISC	even if a few points are labelled in each class, semi-supervised algorithms, which cannot cluster together points of different labels, are  forced  to place a border between the modes
MISC	most probably the border will pass in between the modes, where  the density of points is lower
MISC	hence, the forced border `amplifies' the otherwise less noticed differences between the modes
OWNX	for example, consider the image in fig ~a
MISC	each pixel corresponds to a data point and the similarity score between adjacent pixels is of value unity
MISC	the green and red pixels are labelled while the rest of the blue pixels are unlabelled
OWNX	the desired classification into red and green classes appears in fig ~b
OWNX	it is unlikely that any unsupervised method would partition the data correctly (see eg fig ~c) since the two classes   form  one uniform cluster
MISC	however, using a few labelled points semi-supervised methods which must place a border between the red and green classes may become useful
MISC	in recent years various types of semi-supervised learning algorithms have been proposed, however almost all of these methods share a common basic approach
MISC	different methods vary by the specific energy function and by their minimization procedures; for example the work on graph cuts~ citation , minimizes the cost of a cut in the graph, while others  choose to  minimize the normalized cut cost~ citation , or a quadratic cost~ citation
MISC	as stated recently by~ citation , searching for a minimal energy has a  basic disadvantage, common to all former methods: it ignores the robustness of the found solution
MISC	blum et al mention the case of  several minima with equal energy, where  one arbitrarily chooses one solution, instead of considering them all
MISC	first,  it may happen that the difference in energy between the global minimum, and close by solutions is minuscule, thus picking the minimum as the sole solution may be incorrect or arbitrary
OWNX	an example of the latter case appears in fig ~a;   the classifications provided by three semi-supervised methods appear in fig ~d--f, fail to recover the desired classification, due to a `filament' which connects the  classes *}  searching for  the minimal energy solution is equivalent to seeking the most probable joint classification (map)
MISC	a possible remedy to the difficulties in this approach may then be to consider the probability distribution of all possible classifications
OWNX	blum et al provided a first step in this direction using a randomized min-cut  algorithm
OWNX	in this work we provide a different solution  based on   statistical physics
MISC	classification is then performed by marginalizing (), thus estimating the probability that a point  symbol  belongs to a class  symbol
MISC	this formalism is often referred to  as a markov random field (mrf), which has been applied in numerous works, including in the context of semi-supervised learning by~ citation
OWNX	using the framework of statistical physics has several advantages in the context of semi-supervised learning: first, classification  has a simple probabilistic interpretation
OWNX	our main objective in this paper is to present a framework, which can later be applied in  different directions
MISC	for example, the energy function in () can be any of the functions used in other semi-supervised  methods
OWNX	we do not claim that using this cost function is optimal, and indeed we observed that it is suboptimal in some cases
OWNX	however, we aim to convince the reader that applying our method, to any energy function, would always yield equal or better results than merely minimizing the same energy function
OWNX	section~ presents the qualitative effect of adding labelled points
OWNX	our semi-supervised algorithm is outlined in section~
OWNX	we present an extension of principal component analysis (pca) and a new algorithm for clustering points in  symbol  based on it
MISC	when the input is a sample from a mixture of two arbitrary gaussians, the algorithm correctly classifies the sample assuming only that the two components are separable by a hyperplane, ie , there exists a halfspace that contains most of one gaussian and almost none of the other in probability mass
MISC	the main result may also be stated in the language of linear discriminant analysis: if the standard fisher discriminant  citation  is small enough, labels are not needed to estimate the optimal subspace for projection
OWNX	our main tools are isotropic transformation, spectral projection and a simple reweighting technique
OWNX	we call this combination  isotropic pca
OWNX	we present an extension to principal component analysis (pca), which is able to go beyond standard pca in identifying ``important'' directions
OWNX	when the covariance matrix of the input (distribution or point set in  symbol ) is a multiple of the identity, then pca reveals no information; the second moment along any direction is the same
MISC	such inputs are called isotropic
OWNX	our extension, which we call  isotropic pca , can reveal interesting information in such settings
OWNX	we use this technique to give an affine-invariant clustering algorithm for points in  symbol
OWNX	suppose this distribution is rotated in an unknown way and that we would like to recover the original  symbol  and  symbol  axes
OWNX	for each point in a sample, we may project it to the unit circle and compute the covariance matrix of the resulting point set
OWNX	the  symbol  direction will correspond to the greater eigenvector, the  symbol  direction to the other
MISC	instead of projection onto the unit circle, this process may also be thought of as importance weighting, a technique which allows one to simulate one distribution with another
AIMX	in this case, we are simulating a distribution over the set  symbol , where the density function is proportional to  symbol , so that points near  symbol  or  symbol  are more probable }  in this paper, we describe how to apply this method to mixtures of arbitrary gaussians in  symbol  in order to find a set of directions along which the gaussians are well-separated
MISC	once these directions are identified, points can be classified according to which component of the distribution generated them, and hence all parameters of the mixture can be learned
OWNX	what separates this paper from previous work on learning mixtures is that our algorithm is affine-invariant
MISC	indeed, for every mixture distribution that can be learned using a previously known algorithm, there is a linear transformation of bounded condition number that causes the algorithm to fail
OWNX	for  symbol  components our algorithm has nearly the best possible guarantees (and subsumes all previous results) for clustering gaussian mixtures
OWNX	because our algorithm is affine invariant, it makes it possible to unravel a much larger set of gaussian mixtures than had been possible previously
OWNX	the first step of our algorithm is to place the mixture in isotropic position (see section ) via an affine transformation
MISC	this has the effect of making the  symbol -dimensional fisher subspace, i e , the one that minimizes the fisher discriminant, the same as the subspace spanned by the means of the components (they only coincide in general in isotropic position), for  any  mixture
OWNX	before presenting the ideas and guarantees in more detail, we describe relevant related work
MISC	a unified and elementary treatment is given in these noise settings for two  symbol  minimization methods: the dantzig selector and  symbol  minimization with an  symbol  constraint
MISC	the improvement on the conditions shows that signals with larger support can be recovered accurately
MISC	some results of candes, romberg and tao (2006) and donoho, elad, and temlyakov (2006) are extended
MISC	the problem of recovering a high-dimensional sparse signal based on a small number of measurements, possibly corrupted by noise, has attracted much recent attention
MISC	this problem arises in many different settings, including model selection in linear regression, constructive approximation,  inverse problems, and compressive sensing
MISC	depending on settings, the error vector  symbol  can either be zero (in the noiseless case), bounded, or gaussian where  symbol
MISC	a special case of particular interest is when no noise is present in () and  symbol
MISC	this is an underdetermined system of linear equations with more variables than the number of equations
MISC	it is clear that the problem is ill-posed and there are generally infinite many solutions
MISC	indeed in many cases the unique sparse solution can be found exactly through  symbol  minimization: (p) \min\|\|_1 \mbox{subject to} f= y
MISC	this  symbol  minimization problem has been studied, for example, in fuchs  citation , candes and tao  citation  and donoho  citation
MISC	understanding the noiseless case is not only of significant interest on its own right, it also provides deep insight into the problem of reconstructing sparse signals in the noisy case
MISC	see, for example, candes and tao  citation  and donoho  citation
MISC	when  noise is present, there are two well known  symbol  minimization methods
MISC	one is  symbol  minimization under the  symbol  constraint on the residuals: (p_1) \min\|\|_1 \mbox{subject to} \|y-f\gamma\|_2\epsilon
MISC	writing in terms of the lagrangian function of ( symbol ), this is closely related to finding the solution to the  symbol  regularized least squares:  \min_\left\{\|y-f\gamma\|_2^2 + \rho\|\|_1\right\}
MISC	the latter is often called the lasso in the statistics literature (tibshirani  citation )
MISC	tropp  citation  gave a detailed treatment of the  symbol  regularized least squares problem
MISC	another method, called the dantzig selector, is recently proposed by candes and tao  citation
MISC	the dantzig selector solves the sparse recovery problem through  symbol -minimization with a constraint on the correlation between the residuals and the column vectors of  symbol :  symbol } candes and tao  citation  showed that the dantzig selector can be computed by solving a linear program and it mimics the performance of an oracle procedure up to a logarithmic factor  symbol
MISC	it is clear that regularity conditions are needed in order for these problems to be well behaved
MISC	over the last few years, many interesting results for recovering sparse signals have been obtained in the framework of the  restricted isometry property  (rip)
MISC	in their seminal work  citation , candes and tao considered sparse recovery problems in the rip framework
MISC	several different conditions have been imposed in various settings
MISC	both the dantzig selector (ds) and  symbol  minimization under the  symbol  constraint  symbol  are considered
OWNX	we give a unified and elementary treatment for the two methods under the three noise settings
OWNX	in all cases we solve the problems under the weaker condition  symbol  where  symbol  is the sparsity index and  symbol  and  symbol  are respectively the restricted isometry constant and restricted orthogonality constant defined in section
MISC	the improvement on the condition shows that signals with larger support can be recovered
OWNX	although our main interest is on recovering sparse signals, we state the results in the general setting of reconstructing an arbitrary signal
MISC	another widely used condition for sparse recovery is the so called  mutual incoherence  property  (mip) which requires the pairwise correlations among the column vectors of  symbol  to be small
MISC	see  citation
OWNX	we establish connections between the concepts of rip and mip
OWNX	as an application, we present an improvement to a recent result of donoho, elad, and temlyakov   citation
OWNX	in section , after basic notation and definitions are reviewed, two elementary inequalities, which allow us to make finer analysis of the sparse recovery problem, are introduced
OWNX	we begin the analysis of  symbol  minimization methods for sparse recovery by considering the exact recovery in the noiseless case in section
OWNX	we then consider the case of bounded error in section
MISC	the connections between the rip and mip are also explored
OWNX	the case of gaussian noise is treated in section
MISC	several researchers have recently investigated the connection between reinforcement learning and classification
MISC	the resulting algorithm offers comparable performance to the previous algorithm achieved, however, with significantly less computational effort
MISC	an order of magnitude improvement is demonstrated experimentally in two standard reinforcement learning domains: inverted pendulum and mountain-car
MISC	supervised and reinforcement learning are two well-known learning paradigms, which have been researched mostly independently
MISC	recent studies have investigated the use of supervised learning methods for reinforcement learning, either for value function~\mycite{lagoudakis2003lsp,riedmiller2005nfq} or policy representation~\mycite{lagoudakisicml03,fern2004api,langfordicml05}
MISC	initial results have shown that policies can be approximately represented using either multi-class classifiers or combinations of binary classifiers~\mycite{rexakis+lagoudakis:ewrl2008} and, therefore, it is possible to incorporate classification algorithms within the inner loops of several reinforcement learning algorithms~\mycite{lagoudakisicml03,fern2004api}
MISC	while a variety of promising combinations become possible through this synergy, heretofore there have been limited practical and widely-applicable algorithms
MISC	at each iteration, a new policy/classifier is produced using training data obtained through extensive simulation (rollouts) of the previous policy on a generative model of the process
MISC	a similar algorithm was proposed by fern et al ~\mycite{fern2004api} at around the same time
MISC	the key differences between the two algorithms are related to the types of learning problems they are suitable for, the choice of the underlying classifier type, and the exact form of classifier training
MISC	nevertheless, the main ideas of producing training data using rollouts and iterating over policies remain the same
MISC	even though both of these studies look carefully into the distribution of training states over the state space, their major limitation remains the large amount of sampling employed at each training state
MISC	it is hinted~\mycite{lagoudakisphd03}, however, that great improvement could be achieved with sophisticated management of rollout sampling
OWNX	our paper suggests managing the rollout sampling procedure within the above algorithm with the goal of obtaining comparable training sets (and therefore policies of similar quality), but with significantly less effort in terms of number of rollouts and computation effort
MISC	this is done by viewing the setting as akin to a bandit problem over the rollout states (states sampled using rollouts)
OWNX	our contribution is two-fold: (a) we suitably adapt bandit techniques for rollout management, and (b) we suggest an improved statistical test for identifying early with high confidence states with dominating actions
OWNX	in return, we obtain up to an order of magnitude improvement over the original algorithm in terms of the effort needed to collect the training data for each classifier
OWNX	section~ provides the necessary background and section~ reviews the original algorithm we are based on
OWNX	subsequently, our approach is presented in detail in section~
OWNX	finally, section~ includes experimental results obtained from well-known learning domains
OWNX	we prove existence and uniqueness of the minimizer for the average geodesic distance to the points of a geodesically convex set on the sphere
OWNX	we will show that the function  symbol  defined by%  symbol % attains its global minimum at a unique point on  symbol
MISC	a similar problem has been considered in  citation  and  citation
OWNX	since the problem is rather obvious, it appears likely that a proof of the above result exists somewhere in the literature and we just haven't been able to find it
OWNX	% %ag_18/04/08 update to abstract we propose a framework for analyzing and comparing distributions, allowing us to design statistical tests to determine if two samples are drawn from different distributions
OWNX	our test statistic is the largest difference in expectations over functions in the unit ball of a reproducing kernel hilbert space (rkhs)
OWNX	we present two tests based on large deviation bounds for the test statistic, while a third is based on the asymptotic distribution of this statistic
MISC	several classical metrics on distributions are recovered when the function space used to compute the difference in expectations is allowed to be more general (eg ~a banach space)
OWNX	we apply our two-sample tests  to a variety of problems, including attribute matching for databases using the hungarian marriage method, where they perform strongly
MISC	such tests have application in a variety of areas
OWNX	in bioinformatics, it is of interest to compare microarray data from identical tissue types as measured by different laboratories, to detect whether the data may be analysed jointly, or whether differences in experimental procedure have caused systematic differences in the data distributions
OWNX	equally of interest are comparisons between microarray data from different tissue types, either to determine whether two subtypes of cancer may be treated as statistically indistinguishable from a diagnosis perspective, or to detect differences in healthy and cancerous tissue
MISC	in database attribute matching, it is desirable to merge databases containing multiple fields, where it is not known in advance which fields correspond: the fields are matched by maximising the similarity in the distributions of their entries
OWNX	we use as our test statistic the difference between the mean function values on the two samples; when this is large, the samples are likely from different distributions
OWNX	we call this statistic the maximum mean discrepancy (mmd)
MISC	clearly the quality of the mmd as a statistic  depends on the class  symbol  of smooth functions that define it
MISC	on one hand,  symbol  must be ``rich enough'' so that the population mmd vanishes if and only if  symbol
MISC	on the other hand, for the test to be consistent,  symbol  needs to be ``restrictive'' enough for the empirical estimate of mmd to converge quickly to its expectation as the sample size increases
OWNX	we shall use the unit balls in universal reproducing kernel hilbert spaces  citation  as our function classes, since these will be shown to satisfy both of the foregoing properties (we also review classical metrics on distributions, namely the kolmogorov-smirnov and earth-mover's distances, which are based on different function classes)
MISC	on a more practical note, the mmd has a reasonable computational cost, when compared with other two-sample tests: given  symbol  points sampled from  symbol  and  symbol  from  symbol , the cost is  symbol  time
OWNX	we define three non-parametric statistical tests based on the mmd
MISC	the third test is based on the asymptotic distribution of the mmd, and is in practice more sensitive to differences in distribution at small sample sizes
MISC	note that the latter addresses only the third kind of test, and that the  approach of  citation  employs a more accurate approximation to the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic
OWNX	we also review alternative function classes for which the mmd defines a metric on probability distributions
OWNX	in section , we give an overview of hypothesis testing as it applies to the two-sample problem, and review other approaches to this problem
OWNX	we present our first two hypothesis tests in section ,  based on two different bounds on the deviation between the population and empirical  symbol
OWNX	we take a different approach in section , where we use the asymptotic distribution of the empirical  symbol  estimate as the basis for a third test
OWNX	when large volumes of data are available, the cost of computing the mmd (quadratic in the sample size) may  be excessive: we therefore propose in section  a modified version of the mmd statistic that has a linear cost in the number of samples, and an associated asymptotic test
OWNX	in section , we provide an overview of methods related to the mmd in the statistics and machine learning literature
OWNX	finally, in section , we demonstrate the performance of mmd-based two-sample tests on problems from neuroscience, bioinformatics, and attribute matching using the hungarian marriage method
OWNX	our approach performs well on high dimensional data with low sample size; in addition, we are able to successfully distinguish distributions on graph data,  for which ours is the first proposed test
OWNX	we identify the classical perceptron algorithm with margin as a member of a broader family of large margin classifiers  which we collectively call the margitron
MISC	the margitron, (despite its) sharing the same update rule with the perceptron, is shown  in an incremental setting to converge in a finite number of updates to solutions possessing any desirable fraction of the maximum margin
MISC	it is widely accepted that the larger the margin of the solution hyperplane the greater is the generalisation ability of the learning machine  citation
MISC	the problem, instead, of finding the optimal margin hyperplane lies at the core of support vector machines (svms)  citation
MISC	their efficient implementation, however, is somewhat hindered by the fact that they require solving a quadratic programming problem
MISC	the complications encountered in implementing svms has respurred the interest in alternative large margin classifiers many of which are based on the perceptron algorithm
MISC	such algorithms include romma  citation , alma  citation , cramma  citation  and micra  citation
MISC	there is a connection, however, between such algorithms and the perceptron since their unregularised form with constant learning rate is identical to the perceptron with margin
MISC	notable representatives of this approach are the pioneer norma  citation  and the very recent pegasos  citation
AIMX	a question that arises naturally and which we attempt to answer in the present work is whether it is possible to achieve a guaranteed fraction of the maximum margin larger than  symbol  while retaining the original perceptron update rule
MISC	hopefully, the algorithms belonging to the margitron family by virtue of being generalisations of the very successful perceptron will have a respectable performance in various classification tasks
OWNX	section 2 contains some preliminaries and the description of the margitron algorithm
OWNX	section 3 is devoted to a theoretical analysis
OWNX	section 4 contains our experimental results while section 5 our conclusions
MISC	this relies on weights derived by various estimation techniques based on finite samples
OWNX	we analyze the effect of an error in that estimation on the accuracy of the hypothesis returned by the learning algorithm for two estimation techniques: a cluster-based estimation technique and kernel mean matching
OWNX	we also report the results of sample bias correction experiments with several data sets using these techniques
MISC	in the standard formulation of machine learning problems, the learning algorithm receives training and test samples drawn according to the same distribution
MISC	however, this assumption often does not hold in practice
MISC	the training sample available is  biased  in some way, which may be due to a variety of practical reasons such as the cost of data labeling or acquisition
MISC	the problem occurs in many areas such as astronomy,  econometrics, and species habitat modeling
MISC	in a common instance of this problem, points are drawn according to the test distribution but not all of them are made available to the learner
MISC	this is called the  sample selection bias problem
MISC	remarkably, it is often possible to correct this bias by using large amounts of unlabeled data
MISC	the problem of sample selection bias correction for linear regression has been extensively studied in econometrics and statistics  citation  with the pioneering work of \emcite{heckman}
MISC	several recent machine learning publications  citation  have also dealt with this problem
MISC	this is in fact a technique commonly used in statistics and machine learning for a variety of problems of this type  citation
OWNX	to our knowledge, this problem has not been analyzed in a general manner
OWNX	we show that large families of learning algorithms, including all kernel-based regularization algorithms such as support vector regression (svr)  citation  or kernel ridge regression  citation  are distributionally stable and we give the expression of their stability coefficient for both the  symbol  and  symbol  distance
OWNX	we then analyze two commonly used sample bias correction techniques: a cluster-based estimation technique and kernel mean matching (kmm)  citation
OWNX	for each of these techniques, we derive bounds on the difference of the error rate of the hypothesis returned by a distributionally stable algorithm when using that estimation technique versus using perfect reweighting
OWNX	we briefly discuss and compare these bounds and also report the results of experiments with both estimation techniques for several publicly available machine learning data sets
OWNX	section~ describes in detail the sample selection bias correction technique
OWNX	section~ introduces the concept of distributional stability and proves the distributional stability of kernel-based regularization algorithms
OWNX	section~ analyzes the effect of estimation error using distributionally stable algorithms for both the cluster-based and the kmm estimation techniques
OWNX	section~ reports the results of experiments with several data sets comparing these estimation techniques
OWNX	we define a novel, basic, unsupervised learning problem - learning the lowest density homogeneous hyperplane separator of an unknown probability distribution
MISC	this task is relevant to several problems in machine learning, such as semi-supervised learning and clustering stability
OWNX	we investigate the question of existence of a universally consistent algorithm for this problem
OWNX	we propose two natural learning paradigms and prove that, on input unlabeled random samples generated by any member of a rich family of distributions, they are guaranteed to converge to the optimal separator for that distribution
OWNX	we complement this result by showing that no learning algorithm for our task can achieve uniform learning rates (that are independent of the data generating distribution)
OWNX	in spite of the obvious practical importance of various unsupervised learning tasks, the state of our current knowledge does not provide anything that comes close to the rigorous mathematical performance guarantees that classification prediction theory enjoys
OWNX	we consider the following task:  for an unknown data distribution over  symbol , find the homogeneous hyperplane of lowest density that cuts through that distribution
OWNX	we assume that the underlying data distribution has a continuous density function and that the data available to the learner are finite  iid 
MISC	samples of that distribution
MISC	all of these tasks are notoriously difficult with respect to both the sample complexity and the computational complexity aspects (unless one presumes strong restrictions about the nature of the underlying data distribution)
OWNX	our task seems more modest than these
OWNX	although we are not aware of any previous work on this problem (from the point of view of statistical machine learning, at least), we believe that it is a rather basic problem that is relevant to various practical learning scenarios
MISC	semi-supervised learning is motivated by the fact that in many real world classification problems, unlabeled samples are much cheaper and easier to obtain than labeled examples
MISC	consequently, there is great incentive to develop tools by which such unlabeled samples can be utilized to improve the quality of sample based classifiers
MISC	a common postulate of that type is that the boundary between data classes passes through low-density regions of the data distribution
MISC	roughly speaking, tsvm searches for a hyperplane that has small error on the labeled data and at the same time has wide margin with respect to the unlabeled data sample
MISC	a low-density-cut algorithm for a family  symbol  of probability distributions takes as an input a finite sample generated by some distribution  symbol  and has to output a hyperplane through the origin with low density w r t
MISC	symbol
OWNX	in particular, we consider the family of all distributions over  symbol  that have continuous density functions
OWNX	we investigate two notions of success for low-density-cut algorithms -- uniform convergence (over a family of probability distributions) and consistency
OWNX	for uniform convergence we prove a general negative result, showing that no algorithm can guarantee any fixed convergence rates (in terms of sample sizes)
OWNX	in section  we present two natural learning paradigms for the problem over the real line and prove their universal consistency over a rich class of probability distributions
OWNX	section  extends these results to show the learnability of lowest-density homogeneous linear cuts for probability distributions over  symbol  for arbitrary dimension,  symbol
OWNX	in section  we show that the previous universal consistency results cannot be improved to obtain  uniform  learning rates (by any finite-sample based algorithm)
MISC	the problem consists in inferring properties of the environment from recorded snapshots
OWNX	we consider here the case of a fluid seeded with identical passive particles that diffuse and are advected by a flow
OWNX	our approach rests on efficient algorithms to estimate the weighted number of possible matchings among particles in two consecutive snapshots, the partition function of the underlying graphical model
OWNX	a belief propagation (bp) scheme is the backbone of our algorithm, providing accurate results for the flow parameters we want to learn
MISC	the bp estimate is additionally improved by incorporating loop series (ls) contributions
MISC	for the weighted matching problem, ls is compactly expressed as a cauchy integral, accurately estimated by a saddle point approximation
OWNX	numerical experiments show that the quality of our improved bp algorithm is comparable to the one of a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme, based on the markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) method, while the bp-based scheme is substantially faster than the mcmc scheme
MISC	graphical model approaches to statistical learning and inference are widespread in many fields of science, ranging from machine learning to bioinformatics, statistical physics and error-correction
MISC	such applications often require evaluation of a weighted sum over an exponentially large number of configurations --- a formidable  symbol -hard problem in the majority of cases
MISC	despite of these uncertainties, one expects that reliable estimates of the properties of the environment should still be possible if the number  symbol  of tracked particles is sufficiently large
MISC	the nature of the moving particles and their environment are not subject to particular restrictions, eg they might move actively, such as living organisms, or passively
OWNX	here, we shall consider the case of a fluid seeded with passive particles, a problem arising in the context of fluid mechanics experiments
MISC	given a statistical model of the fluid flow with unknown parameters, along with the positions of  symbol  indistinguishable particles in two subsequent snapshots, one aims at predicting the most probable values of the model parameters
OWNX	this task is formally stated in section~ as searching for the maximum of a weighted sum over all possible matchings between particles in the two snapshots
MISC	the problem turns out to be equivalent to computing the permanent of a non-negative matrix, known to be a  symbol -complete problem~ citation
AIMX	the main contribution of this paper is  an efficient and accurate algorithm of belief   propagation (bp) type for calculating the permanent  for the class of weight matrices arising from the particle tracking problem
MISC	the bp algorithm seeks a minimum of the bethe free energy~ citation  for a suitable graphical model
MISC	the graphical model is a fully connected bipartite graph: nodes are associated with the measured particles, edges are weighted according to the model of the flow transporting the particles and constraints enforce the condition that exactly one edge per node is active
MISC	it is known that bp gives the exact result for the maximum likelihood version of the problem (finding a maximum weight matching) in spite of multiple loops characterizing the graphical model~ citation
OWNX	the bp algorithm for the matching problem is derived and discussed in section~
MISC	bp equations could be understood as a re-parametrization, or gauge transformation, of factor functions in the graphical model~ citation
MISC	furthermore, bp solutions also provide an explicit representation of the exact partition function in terms of the so-called loop series~ citation
OWNX	our improved bp achieves comparable accuracy, with significant gains in terms of speed

MISC	as a fundamental problem in pattern recognition, graph matching has applications in a variety of fields, from computer vision to computational biology
MISC	in graph matching, patterns are modeled as graphs and pattern recognition amounts to finding a correspondence between the nodes of different graphs
MISC	many formulations of this problem can be cast in general as a quadratic assignment problem, where a linear term in the objective function encodes node compatibility and a quadratic term encodes edge compatibility
OWNX	we present a method for  learning graph matching : the training examples are pairs of graphs and the `labels' are matches between them
OWNX	our experimental results reveal that learning can substantially improve the performance of standard graph matching algorithms
OWNX	in particular, we find that simple linear assignment with such a learning scheme outperforms graduated assignment with bistochastic normalisation, a state-of-the-art quadratic assignment relaxation algorithm
MISC	in particular they are extensively used in the field of computer vision, where many problems can be formulated as an attributed graph matching problem
MISC	graph matching then consists of finding a correspondence between nodes of the two graphs such that they 'look most similar' when the vertices are labeled according to such a correspondence
MISC	typically, the problem is mathematically formulated as a quadratic assignment problem, which consists of finding the assignment that maximizes an objective function encoding local compatibilities (a linear term) and structural compatibilities (a quadratic term)
MISC	the main body of research in graph matching has then been focused on devising more accurate and/or faster algorithms to solve the problem approximately (since it is np-hard); the compatibility functions used in graph matching are typically handcrafted
MISC	for example, assume first that  symbol  and  symbol  come from two images acquired by a surveillance camera in an airport's lounge; now, assume the same  symbol  and  symbol  instead come from two images in a photographer's image database; should the optimal match be the same in both situations
MISC	if the algorithm takes into account exclusively the graphs to be matched, the optimal solutions will be the same since the graph pair is the same in both cases
MISC	this is the standard way graph matching is approached today
MISC	we argue that if we know the `conditions' under which a pair of graphs has been extracted, then we should take into account  how graphs arising in those conditions are typically matched
OWNX	however, we do not take the information on the conditions explicitly into account, since this would obviously be impractical
OWNX	instead, we approach the problem purely from a statistical inference perspective
OWNX	first, we extract graphs from a number of images acquired under the same conditions as those for which we want to solve, whatever the word `conditions' means (e g ~from the surveillance camera or the photographer's database)
OWNX	we then  manually  provide what we understand to be the optimal matches between the resulting graphs
MISC	this information is then used in a  learning  algorithm which learns a map from the space of pairs of graphs to the space of matches
MISC	in terms of the quadratic assignment problem, this learning algorithm amounts to (in loose language) adjusting the node and edge compatibility functions such that the expected optimal match in a test pair of graphs agrees with the expected match they would have had, had they been in the training set
MISC	in this formulation, the learning problem consists of a convex, quadratic program which is readily solvable by means of a column generation procedure
OWNX	we provide experimental evidence that applying learning to standard graph matching algorithms significantly improves their performance
OWNX	in fact, we show that learning improves upon non-learning results so dramatically that linear assignment  with learning  outperforms graduated assignment with bistochastic normalisation, a state-of-the-art quadratic assignment relaxation algorithm
OWNX	also, by introducing learning in graduated assignment itself, we obtain results that improve both in accuracy and speed over the best existing quadratic assignment relaxations
MISC	the fundamental quantity of interest is the sample complexity: the number of samples required to learn to a specified level of accuracy
OWNX	here we consider learning over the set of all computable labeling functions
OWNX	since the vc-dimension is infinite and a priori (uniform) bounds on the number of samples are impossible, we let the learning algorithm decide when it has seen sufficient samples to have learned
OWNX	we then show, however, that bounding sample complexity independently of the distribution is impossible
MISC	notably, this impossibility is entirely due to the requirement that the learning algorithm be computable,  and not due to the statistical nature of the problem
MISC	suppose we are trying to learn a difficult classification problem: for example determining whether the given image contains a human face,  or whether the mri image shows a malignant tumor, etc
OWNX	we may first try to train a simple model such as a small neural network
MISC	conventional statistical learning theory attempts to bound the number of samples needed to learn to a specified level of accuracy for each of the above models (e g \ neural networks, support vector machines)
MISC	specifically, it is enough to bound the vc-dimension of the learning model to determine the number of samples to use~ citation
MISC	however, if we allow ourselves to change the model, then the vc-dimension of the overall learning algorithm is not finite, and much of statistical learning theory does not directly apply
MISC	accepting that much of the time the complexity of the model cannot be a priori bounded,  structural risk minimization~ citation  explicitly considers a hierarchy of increasingly complex models
OWNX	we consider the unrestricted learning model consisting of all computable classifiers
MISC	since the vc-dimension is clearly infinite,  there are no uniform bounds (independent of the distribution and the target concept) on the number of samples needed to learn accurately~ citation
OWNX	yet we still want to guarantee a desired level of accuracy
MISC	rather than deciding on the number of samples a priori,  it is natural to allow the learning algorithm to decide when it has seen sufficiently many labeled samples based on the training samples seen up to now and their labels
OWNX	since the above learning model includes any practical classification scheme, we term it universal (pac-) learning
OWNX	we first show that there is a computable learning algorithm in our universal setting
OWNX	then, in order to obtain bounds on the number of training samples that would be needed, we consider measuring sample complexity of the learning algorithm as a function of the unknown correct labeling function (i e \ target concept)
OWNX	however, we prove that it is impossible to bound the sample complexity of any  computable  universal learning algorithm, even as a function of the target concept
MISC	the impossibility of a distribution-independent bound is entirely due to the computability requirement
OWNX	indeed we show there is an uncomputable learning procedure for which we bound the number of samples queried as a function of the unknown target concept, independently of the distribution
OWNX	moreover, we present a probabilistic algorithm generating with probability close to one a sequence with a subsequence which simultaneously miscalibrates all partially weakly computable randomized forecasting algorithms
MISC	let a binary sequence  symbol  of outcomes is observed by a forecaster whose task is to give a probability  symbol  of a future event  symbol
MISC	the evaluation of probability forecasts is based on a method called  calibration : informally, following dawid~ citation  forecaster is said to be well-calibrated if for any  symbol  the event  symbol  holds in  symbol  of moments of time as he choose  symbol  (see also~ citation )
OWNX	for any finite or an infinite sequence  symbol , we write  symbol  (we put  symbol )
MISC	also,  symbol  denotes the length of the sequence  symbol
MISC	if  symbol  is a finite sequence and  symbol  is a finite or infinite sequence then  symbol  denotes the concatenation of these sequences,  symbol  means that  symbol  for some  symbol
MISC	in other words, all conditional probabilities  symbol  symbol symbol \omega_1,\omega_2,,\omega_{n-1} symbol p_n symbol symbol p_n symbol f:\xi[0,1] symbol f symbol \omega_1,,\omega_{n-1},symbol f symbol \omega=\omega_1\omega_2symbol p_i=f(\omega_1\dots\omega_{i-1}) symbol i=1,2,symbol f(\alpha;x) symbol \omega_x symbol pr_x symbol x\insymbol symbol symbol pr_{\omega^{i-1}} symbol pr symbol \omega_{\omega^{i-1}} symbol i=1,2,symbol \delta>0 symbol f symbol \omega=\omega_1\omega_2symbol pr symbol n\tosymbol p_i=f(\omega^{n-1}) symbol i(p) symbol [0,1] symbol c(\omega^{i-1},p)=\delta(\omega^{i-1})i(p) symbol \delta:\xi\to\{0,1\} symbol i(p) symbol [0,1] symbol p_i=f(\alpha;\omega^{i-1},p^{i-1}) symbol p^{i-1}=p_1,,p_{i-1} symbol k=1,2,symbol \{\delta_k\} symbol \{i_k\} symbol [0,1] symbol \{\delta_k i_k\} symbol k=1,2,symbol \delta>0 symbol \omega=\omega_1\omega_2symbol n\tosymbol p_i=f(\omega^{n-1},p^{i-1}) symbol i(p_i) symbol \delta_k(\omega^{i-1})i_k(p_i) symbol k=1,2,symbol \{\delta_k\} symbol p_i=f(\alpha;\omega^{i-1}) symbol symbol p_i=f(\alpha;\omega^{i-1}) symbol symbol symbol i symbol f$
OWNX	we present some modification of kalai and vempala algorithm of following the perturbed leader for the case of unrestrictedly large one-step gains
OWNX	we show that in general case the cumulative gain of any probabilistic prediction algorithm can be much worse than the gain of some expert of the pool
MISC	experts algorithms are used for online prediction or repeated decision making or repeated game playing
MISC	any such algorithm is based on a ``pool of experts''
MISC	from this, a ``master decision'' is performed
MISC	after that, losses (or rewards)  symbol  are assigned to each expert  symbol  by the environment (or adversary)
MISC	the master algorithm also receives some loss or reward depending on the master decision
MISC	the goal of the master algorithm is to perform almost as well as the best expert in hindsight in the long run
MISC	after that, at the beginning of the step  symbol   learner  makes a decision to follow one of these experts, say expert  symbol
MISC	at the end of step  symbol  learner receives the same gain or loss as expert  symbol  at step  symbol
OWNX	we use notations and definitions from~ citation  and~ citation
MISC	let  symbol  be the cumulative loss of expert  symbol  at time  symbol
MISC	given  symbol ,  symbol , at time  symbol , a natural idea to solve the expert problem is ``to follow the leader'', i e to select the expert  symbol  which performed best in the past
MISC	the following simple example from kalai and vempala~ citation  shows that learner can perform much worse than each expert: let the current losses of two experts on steps  symbol  be  symbol  and  symbol
MISC	hutter and poland~ citation  presented a further developments of the fpl algorithm for countable class of experts, arbitrary weights and adaptive learning rate
MISC	the fpl algorithm outputs prediction of an expert  symbol  which minimizes  symbol  symbol \xi_t^i symbol i=1,m symbol t=1,2,symbol p(t)=e^{-t} symbol symbol  symbol  symbol symbol n symbol i symbol t symbol 0s^i_t1 symbol t symbol b_t symbol s_tb_t symbol t symbol s^i_t symbol i symbol 0s^i_t1$ seems to be too restrictive
OWNX	we show that in general case, the cumulative gain of any probabilistic prediction algorithm can be much worse than the gain of some expert of the pool
OWNX	nevertheless, we give the lower bound for cumulative gain of any probabilistic algorithm in general case and prove that our universal algorithm has optimal performance; we also prove that in case when one-step gains of experts of the pool have ``limited deviations'' (in particular, when they are bounded) the performance of our algorithm is close to the performance of the best expert
MISC	the method boils down to a statistical estimation task and various estimators have been proposed, based on the  geometric mean , the  harmonic mean , and the  fractional power  etc
MISC	this study proposes the optimal quantile  estimator, whose main operation is selecting , which is considerably less expensive than taking fractional power, the main operation in previous estimators
OWNX	our experiments report that the  optimal quantile  estimator is nearly one order of magnitude more computationally efficient than previous estimators
MISC	for  large-scale learning  tasks in which storing and computing pairwise distances is a serious bottleneck, this estimator should be desirable
MISC	in addition to its computational advantages, the  optimal quantile  estimator exhibits nice theoretical properties
MISC	it is more accurate than previous estimators when {symbol }
OWNX	we  derive its theoretical error bounds and  establish the explicit (i e , no hidden constants) sample complexity bound
MISC	many applications in machine learning and data mining require computing  pairwise  symbol  distances in a data matrix  symbol
MISC	for massive high-dimensional data, computing all pairwise distances of  symbol  can be infeasible
MISC	in fact, even  storing  symbol  or all pairwise distances of  symbol  in the memory may be also infeasible
MISC	
MISC	
OWNX	we propose two strategies for applying random projections
MISC	the basic projection strategy requires only one projection matrix but it is more difficult to analyze, while the alternative projection strategy requires  symbol  projection matrices but its theoretical analysis  is much easier
MISC	this study proposes a simple method for efficiently computing the  symbol  distances in a massive data matrix  symbol  for  symbol  (where  symbol  is even), using  random projections  citation
MISC	this work proposes using random projections for  symbol , a least for some special cases
MISC	machine learning algorithms often operate on the  symbol  distances of  symbol  instead of the original data
MISC	the widely used ``kernel trick,'' (e g , for support vector machines (svm)), is often constructed on top of the  symbol   distances citation
OWNX	here we can treat  symbol  as a  tuning  parameter
MISC	it is common to take  symbol  ( euclidian  distance), or  symbol  ( infinity distance ),  symbol  ( manhattan  distance),  or  symbol  ( hamming  distance); but in principle any  symbol  values are possible
MISC	in modern data mining and learning applications, the ubiquitous phenomenon of ``massive data'' imposes challenges
MISC	for example, pre-computing and storing all pairwise  symbol  distances in  memory at the cost  symbol  can be infeasible when  symbol  (or even just  symbol ) citation
OWNX	in the meanwhile, modern  applications can routinely involve millions of observations; and developing scalable  learning and data mining algorithms has  been an active research direction
MISC	one commonly used strategy in current practice is   to compute the distances  on the fly  citation , in stead of storing all pairwise  symbol  distances
MISC	data reduction algorithms such as  sampling or sketching methods are also popular
MISC	while there have been extensive studies on approximating the  symbol  distances for  symbol ,  symbol  can be useful too
MISC	thus, the fourth moments are critical, for example, in the field of  independent component analysis (ica)  citation
MISC	therefore, it is viable to use the  symbol  distance for  symbol  when  lower order distances can not efficiently differentiate data
MISC	in the theoretical cs community, there have been many studies on approximating the  symbol  norms and distances citation , some of which also applicable to the  symbol  distances (e g , comparing two long vectors)
MISC	those papers proved that small space ( symbol ) algorithms exist only for  symbol
OWNX	we study the a priori semimeasure of sets of  symbol -random  infinite sequences, where  symbol  is a family of probability distributions depending on a real parameter  symbol
OWNX	in the case when for a computable probability distribution  symbol  an effectively strictly consistent estimator exists, we show that the levin's a priory semimeasure of the set of all  symbol -random sequences is positive if and only if the parameter  symbol  is a computable real number
OWNX	for the bernoulli family  symbol , we show that the a priory semimeasure of the set  symbol , where  symbol  is the set of all  symbol -random sequences and the union is taken over all non-random  symbol , is positive
OWNX	we use algorithmic randomness theory to analyze ``the size'' of sets  of infinite sequences random with respect to parametric families of probability distributions
MISC	let a parametric family of probability distributions  symbol , where  symbol  is a real number, be given such that an effectively strictly consistent estimator exists for this family
MISC	the bernoulli family with a real parameter  symbol  is an example of such family
MISC	theorem~ shows that the levin's a priory semimeasure of the set of all  symbol -random sequences is positive if and only if the parameter value  symbol  is a computable real number
MISC	in this respect, the model of the biased coin with ``a prespecified'' probability  symbol  of head is meaningless when  symbol  is a noncomputable real number; noncomputable parameters  symbol  can have empirical meaning only in their totality, i e , as elements of some uncountable sets
MISC	for example,  symbol -random sequences with noncomputable  symbol  can be generated by a bayesian mixture of these  symbol  using a computable prior
MISC	in this case, evidently, the semicomputable semimeasure of the set of all sequences random with respect to this mixture is positive
OWNX	we give in appendix~ the simple proof of our previous result (formulated in theorem~) which says that the levin's a priory semimeasure of the set of all infinite binary sequences non-equivalent by turing to martin-l\"of random sequences is positive
MISC	in particular,  these sequences are non-random with respect to each computable probability  distribution
OWNX	we use this result to prove theorem~
OWNX	we propose a general method called truncated gradient to induce sparsity in the weights of online learning algorithms with convex loss functions
MISC	this method has several essential properties:   the degree of sparsity is continuous---a parameter controls the rate of sparsification from no sparsification to total sparsification
MISC	the approach is theoretically motivated, and an instance of it can be regarded as an online counterpart of the popular  symbol -regularization method in the batch setting
OWNX	we prove that small rates of sparsification result in only small additional regret with respect to typical online learning guarantees
OWNX	we apply the approach to several datasets and find that for datasets with large numbers of features, substantial sparsity is discoverable
OWNX	we are concerned with machine learning over large datasets
MISC	in this setting, many common approaches fail, simply because they cannot load the dataset into memory or they are not sufficiently efficient
MISC	there are roughly two approaches which can work:   parallelize a batch learning algorithm over many machines ( eg ,  citation )
MISC	stream the examples to an online learning algorithm ( eg ,  citation ,  citation ,  citation , and  citation )
MISC	typical online learning algorithms have at least one weight for every feature, which is too much in some applications for a couple reasons:    space constraints
MISC	a similar problem occurs if the state overflows the l2 cache
MISC	test time constraints on computation
MISC	for example:    simply adding  symbol  regularization to the gradient of an online weight update doesn't work because gradients don't induce sparsity
MISC	the essential difficulty is that a gradient update has the form  symbol  where  symbol  and  symbol  are two floats
MISC	very few float pairs add to  symbol  (or any other default value) so there is little reason to expect a gradient update to accidentally produce sparsity
MISC	simply rounding weights to  symbol  is problematic because a weight may be small due to being useless or small because it has been updated only once (either at the beginning of training or because the set of features appearing is also sparse)
MISC	these approaches typically run an algorithm many times which is particularly undesirable with large datasets
MISC	algorithm selection is typically based on models of algorithm performance,  learned during a separate  offline  training sequence, which can be  prohibitively expensive
OWNX	in recent work, we adopted an  online  approach, in which a performance model is iteratively updated and used to guide selection on a sequence of problem instances
MISC	the resulting  exploration-exploitation  trade-off was represented as a bandit problem with expert advice, using an  existing solver for this game, but this required the setting of an arbitrary  bound on algorithm runtimes, thus invalidating the optimal regret of the solver
OWNX	we adapt an existing solver to this game, proving a bound on its expected regret,  which holds also for the resulting algorithm selection technique
OWNX	we present  preliminary experiments with a set of sat solvers on a mixed sat-unsat benchmark
MISC	decades of research in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence brought us a variety of alternative algorithms for solving many kinds of problems
MISC	algorithms often display variability in performance quality, and computational cost, depending on the particular problem instance being solved: in other words, there is no single ``best'' algorithm
MISC	while a ``trial and error'' approach is still the most popular, attempts to automate algorithm selection are not new   citation , and have grown to form a consistent and dynamic field of research in the area of  meta-learning   citation
MISC	many selection methods follow an  offline  learning scheme, in which the availability of a  large training set of performance data for the different algorithms is assumed
MISC	this data is used to learn a model that %can  maps ( problem ,  algorithm ) pairs to expected performance, or to some probability distribution on performance
MISC	in other words, there is an obvious trade-off  between the  exploration  of algorithm performances on different problem instances, aimed at learning the model, and the  exploitation  of the best algorithm/problem combinations, based on the model's predictions
MISC	this trade-off is typically ignored  in offline algorithm selection, and the size of the training set  is chosen heuristically
OWNX	in our previous work  citation , we have kept an  online  view of algorithm selection, in which the only input available to the meta-learner is a set of algorithms, of  unknown performance, and a sequence of problem instances that have to be solved
MISC	one important obstacle to the straightforward application of a bandit problem solver to algorithm selection is that most existing solvers assume a bound on losses to be available beforehand
OWNX	the result is a  parameterless online algorithm selection method,  the first, to our knowledge, with a provable upper bound on regret
OWNX	section  presents our framework for representing algorithm selection as a bandit problem, discussing the introduction of a higher level of selection among different algorithm selection techniques ( time allocators )
OWNX	section  introduces the modified bandit problem solver for unbounded loss games,  along with its bound on regret
OWNX	section  describes   experiments with sat solvers
MISC	previous studies on multi-instance learning typically treated instances in the  bags  as  independently and identically distributed
MISC	the instances in a bag, however, are rarely independent in real tasks, and a better performance can be expected if the instances are treated in an non- iid 
OWNX	in the first method, we explicitly map every bag to an undirected graph and design a graph kernel for distinguishing the positive and negative bags
MISC	the effectiveness of the proposed methods are validated by experiments
MISC	in multi-instance learning  citation , each training example is a  bag  of instances
MISC	although the labels of the training bags are known, however, the labels of the instances in the bags are unknown
MISC	in contrast to representing the whole image as a single-instance, if we represent each part as an instance, then the partition information is captured by the multi-instance representation; and if the partition is meaningful (e g , each part corresponds to a region of saliency), the additional information captured by the multi-instance representation may be helpful to make the learning task easier to deal with
MISC	it is obviously not a good idea to apply multi-instance learning techniques everywhere since if the single-instance representation is sufficient, using multi-instance representation just gilds the lily
MISC	however, as zhou and xu  citation  indicated, previous studies on multi-instance learning typically treated the instances in the bags as independently and identically distributed; this neglects the fact that the relations among the instances convey important structure information
MISC	considering the above image task again, treating the different image parts as inter-correlated samples is evidently more meaningful than treating them as unrelated samples
MISC	actually, the instances in a bag are rarely independent, and a better performance can be expected if the instances are treated in an non- iid 
OWNX	experiments show that our proposed methods achieve performances highly competitive with state-of-the-art multi-instance learning methods
OWNX	we also derive an analytical universal upper bound on the performance of the optimal policy
OWNX	we then consider the more practical scenario where the exact distribution of the signal from the primary is unknown
MISC	we assume a parametric model for the distribution and develop an algorithm that can learn the true distribution, still guaranteeing the constraint on the interference probability
OWNX	we show that this algorithm outperforms the naive design that assumes a worst case value for the parameter
OWNX	we also provide a proof for the convergence of the learning algorithm
MISC	the idea is to sense times when a specific licensed band is not used at a particular place and use this band for unlicensed transmissions without causing interference to the licensed user (referred to as the `primary')
MISC	an important part of designing such systems is to develop an efficient channel selection policy
MISC	the sensing and access policies should jointly ensure that the probability of interfering with the primary's transmission meets a given constraint
AIMX	in the first part of this paper, we consider the design of such a joint sensing and access policy, assuming a markovian model for the primary spectrum usage on the channels being monitored
OWNX	we obtain a suboptimal solution to the resultant pomdp problem
OWNX	we develop an algorithm that learns these unknown statistics and show that this scheme gives improved performance over the naive scheme that assumes a worst-case value for the unknown distribution
MISC	the adaptation rule for vector quantization algorithms, and consequently the convergence of the generated sequence, depends on the  existence and properties of a function called the energy function, defined on a topological manifold
MISC	the results presented here supplement previous studies, including  citation ,  citation ,  citation , citation  and  citation
OWNX	our work shows that the energy function is not always a potential but at least the uniform limit of a series of potential functions which we call a pseudo-potential
OWNX	the framework we define opens the way to study the convergence of all the corresponding adaptation rules at once, and a theorem gives  promising insights in that direction
OWNX	we also demonstrate that the "k-means" energy function is a pseudo-potential but not a potential in general
MISC	in vector quantization theory  citation , a set of prototypes    symbol  is placed on a manifold  symbol , in order to minimize the following integral function, called the "energy function":   symbol } where  symbol  indicates the probability density defined on  symbol
OWNX	we focus on the stochastic iterative approaches where at each time step, a datum  symbol  is drawn from the probability density function (pdf)  symbol , and the prototypes  symbol  are adapted according to  symbol  using the adaptation rule:  symbol } where the adaptation step is tuned using the parameter  symbol  generally decreasing over the time ( symbol  is taken thereafter equal to 1 without restricting the general results), and  symbol  is a "neighborhood" function particular to each vector quantization algorithm
OWNX	here we focus on discontinuous  symbol  functions
MISC	a main concern in the field of vector quantization, is to decide whether the adaptation rule () corresponds or not to a stochastic gradient descent along the energy function (),  i e whether this energy function is or is not a potential onto the entire manifold  symbol
MISC	for example, the energy function associated to the k-means algorithm  citation , stochastic version of the lbg algorithm of linde  et al citation , is a potential as long as the pdf  symbol  is continuous  citation
MISC	on the other hand, if the energy function is not a potential, then very few is known about the convergence of the corresponding adaptation rule
OWNX	we know these algorithms converge in practice toward acceptable value of their energy functions whenever they are proved to be associated or not to potentials
MISC	however, the theoretical study of their convergence is not available, so they remain largely heuristics
MISC	among all these algorithms, the neural-gas  citation  deserves a particular attention
MISC	it has been claimed by its authors  to be associated to a global potential in general, hence to a converging adaptation rule
OWNX	we study this framework and we demonstrate that the energy function associated to these algorithms is not a potential in general
OWNX	we also demonstrate that this energy function belongs to a broad class of functions which includes potential functions as a special case
MISC	the energy functions within this class are called "pseudo-potentials"
OWNX	in section 2, we present the framework of this study
OWNX	in section 3, we define  a "pseudo-potential" function, which can be approximated by a series of potential functions: we define the concept of cellular manifold and this series of potentials
OWNX	in section 4, we give the main theorem which states that an energy function of that framework is necessarily a pseudo-potential
OWNX	we consider the k-means to show that pseudo-potentials are not always potentials
OWNX	we discuss the consequence on the convergence of the corresponding adaptation rule
OWNX	in section 5, we show that most of the common vector quantization algorithms belong to that framework
OWNX	at last we conclude in section 6
OWNX	we present a novel graphical framework for modeling non-negative sequential data with hierarchical structure
OWNX	our model corresponds to a network of coupled non-negative matrix factorization (nmf) modules, which we refer to as a positive factor network (pfn)
MISC	this is a desirable property for modeling problems in computational auditory scene analysis, since distinct sound sources in the environment are often well-modeled as combining additively in the corresponding magnitude spectrogram
OWNX	we propose inference and learning algorithms that leverage existing nmf algorithms and that are straightforward to implement
OWNX	we show how a target process characterized by a hierarchical state transition model can be represented as a pfn
OWNX	our results illustrate that a pfn which is defined in terms of a single target observation can then be used to effectively track the states of multiple simultaneous targets
OWNX	our results show that the quality of the inferred target states degrades gradually as the observation noise is increased
OWNX	we also propose a network for language modeling
OWNX	we present a graphical hidden variable framework for modeling non-negative sequential data with hierarchical structure
OWNX	our framework is intended for applications where the observed data is non-negative and is well-modeled as a non-negative linear combination of underlying non-negative components
OWNX	provided that we are able to adequately model these underlying components individually, the full model will then be capable of representing any observed additive mixture of the components due to the linearity property
OWNX	thus, in our approach, we do not need to be concerned with explicitly modeling the maximum number of observed components nor their relative weights in the mixture signal
MISC	to motivate the approach, consider the problem of computational auditory scene analysis (casa), which involves identifying auditory ``objects'' such as musical instrument sounds, human voice, various environmental noises, etc, from an audio recording
MISC	speech recognition and music transcription are specific examples of casa problems
MISC	when analyzing audio, it is common to first transform the audio signal into a time-frequency image, such as the spectrogram (i e , magnitude of the short-time fourier transform (stft))
OWNX	we empirically observe that the spectrogram of a mixture of auditory sources is often well-modeled as a linear combination of the spectrograms of the individual audio sources, due to the sparseness of the time-frequency representation for typical audio sources
MISC	for example, consider a recording of musical piece performed by a band
OWNX	we empirically observe that the spectrogram of the recording tends to be well-approximated as the sum of the spectrograms of the individual instrument notes played in isolation
MISC	such a model would have obvious applications to speaker source separation and simultaneous multiple-speaker speech recognition
OWNX	rather, our primary objective here will be to construct models that are simple enough to illustrate the interesting properties of our approach, yet complex enough to show that our approach is noise-robust, capable of learning from training data, and at least somewhat scalable
OWNX	we hope that the results presented here will provide sufficient motivation for others to extend our ideas and begin experimenting with more sophisticated pfns, perhaps applying them to the above-mentioned casa problems
OWNX	an existing area of research that is related to our approach is non-negative matrix factorization (nmf) and its extensions
MISC	lee and seung later developed robust and simple to implement multiplicative update rules for iteratively performing the factorization  citation
MISC	various sparse versions of nmf have also been recently proposed  citation ,  citation ,  citation
MISC	nmf has recently been applied to many applications where a representation of non-negative data as an additive combination of non-negative basis vectors seems reasonable
MISC	such applications include object modeling in computer vision, magnitude spectra modeling of audio signals  citation , and various source separation applications  citation
MISC	for this reason, extensions have been proposed to make nmf more expressive
MISC	smaragdis extended nmf in  citation  to model the temporal dependencies in successive spectrogram time slices
OWNX	his nmf extension, which he termed  convolutive nmf , also appears to be a special case of one of our example models in section~
CONT	we are unaware of any existing work in the literature that allow for the general graphical representation of complex hidden variable models, particularly sequential data models, that is provided by our approach, however
OWNX	we note that the hidden markov model (hmm) is a special case of a dbn
MISC	dbns are widely used for speech recognition and other sequential data modeling applications
OWNX	probabilistic graphical models are appealing because they they can represent complex model structure using an intuitive and modular graphical modeling representation
OWNX	our objective in this paper is to present a framework for modeling non-negative data that retains the non-negative linear representation of nmf, while also supporting more structured hidden variable data models with a graphical means for representing variable interdependencies analogously to that of the probabilistic graphical models framework
OWNX	our framework is essentially a modular extension of nmf in which the full graphical model corresponds to several coupled nmf sub-models
MISC	the overall model then corresponds to a system of coupled vector or matrix factorization equations
OWNX	we will refer to the dynamical extension of a pfn as a  dynamic positive factor network (dpfn)
OWNX	note that our definition of inference is distinct from the probabilistic notion of inference
OWNX	let us call this class of models  probabilistic pfns
MISC	exact inference is generally intractable in such a model since the hidden variables are continuous-valued and the model is not linear-gaussian
MISC	however, one could consider deriving algorithms for performing approximate inference and developing a corresponding em-based learning algorithm
OWNX	we are unaware of any existing algorithms for performing tractable approximate inference in a probabilistic pfn
OWNX	it is possible that our pfn inference algorithm may also have a probabilistic interpretation, but exploring the idea further is outside the scope of this paper
OWNX	rather, in this paper our objective is to to develop and motivate the inference and learning algorithms by taking a modular approach in which existing nmf algorithms are used and coupled in a way that seems to be intuitively reasonable
OWNX	our empirical results show that the proposed inference and learning algorithms are fairly robust to additive noise and have good convergence properties
MISC	by leveraging existing nmf multiplicative update algorithms, the pfn inference and learning algorithms have the advantage of being straightforward to implement, even for relatively large networks
OWNX	similar to existing nmf algorithms, our algorithms are highly parallel and can be optimized to take advantage of parallel hardware such as multi-core cpus and potentially also stream processing hardware such as gpus
OWNX	in section~, we present the basic pfn model
OWNX	we show how a target process characterized by a hierarchical state transition model can be represented by a pfn
OWNX	our results illustrate that a pfn which is defined in terms of a single target observation can then be used to effectively track the states of multiple simultaneous targets in the observed data
OWNX	in section~, we propose a dpfn for modeling the sequence of words or characters in a text document as an additive factored transition model of word features
MISC	we also propose slightly modified versions lee and seung's update rules to avoid numerical stability issues
OWNX	we prove that mutual information is actually negative copula entropy, based on which a method for mutual information estimation is proposed
MISC	in information theory, mutual information (mi) is a difference concept with entropy
OWNX	based on this insightful result, we propose a simple method for estimating mutual information
MISC	citation  sklar  citation  proved that joint distribution  symbol  can be represented with copula  symbol  and margins  symbol  in the following form:  symbol *} derived by separating the margins from joint distribution, copula has all the dependence information of random variables, which is believed that mutual information does as well
MISC	symbol  denote copula function and copula density;  symbol  denotes joint distribution and marginal distribution;  symbol  denote entropy, mutual information, and copula entropy respectively
MISC	in many fields where human understanding plays a crucial role, such as bioprocesses, the capacity of extracting knowledge from data is of critical importance
MISC	within this framework, fuzzy learning methods, if properly used, can greatly help human experts
MISC	amongst these methods, the aim of orthogonal transformations, which have been proven to be mathematically robust, is to build rules from a set of training data and to select the most important ones by linear regression or rank revealing techniques
MISC	however, it was originally designed so that it only cared about numerical performance
OWNX	thus, we propose some modifications of the original method to take interpretability into account
OWNX	finally, the algorithm is applied to a real-world fault detection depollution problem
MISC	these considerations explain why interpretability issues in fuzzy modeling have become an important research topic, as shown in recent literature  citation
MISC	even so, the meaning given to interpretability in fuzzy modeling is not always the same
MISC	by interpretability, some authors mean mathematical interpretability, as in  citation  where a structure is developed in takagi-sugeno systems, that leads to the interpretation of every consequent polynomial as a taylor series expansion about the rule center
MISC	others mean linguistic interpretability, as in  citation ,  citation
MISC	commonly admitted requirements for interpretability are a small number of consistent membership functions and a reasonable number of rules in the fuzzy system
MISC	orthogonal transformation methods provide a set of tools for building rules from data and selecting a limited subset of rules
MISC	those methods were originally designed for linear optimization, but subject to some conditions they can be used in fuzzy models
MISC	for instance, a zero order takagi sugeno model can be written as a set of r fuzzy rules, the  symbol  rule being:   symbol }  where  symbol  are the fuzzy sets associated to the  symbol  variables for that given rule, and  symbol  is the corresponding crisp rule conclusion
MISC	let  symbol  be  symbol  input-output pairs of a data set, where  symbol  and  symbol
MISC	for the  symbol  pair, the above takagi sugeno model output is calculated as follows:  symbol } in equation ,  symbol  is the conjunction operator used to combine elements in the rule premise,  symbol  represents, within the  symbol  rule, the membership function value for  symbol
MISC	orthogonal transformation methods can then be used to determine the  symbol  to be kept, and to assign them optimal values in order to design a zero order takagi sugeno model from the data set
MISC	a thorough review of the use of orthogonal transformation methods (svd, qr, ols) to select fuzzy rules  can be found in  citation
MISC	the first family of methods (rank revealing techniques) is particularly interesting when the input fuzzy partitions include redundant or quasi redundant fuzzy sets
MISC	with respect to this criterion, it gives a good summary of the system to be modeled, which explains why it has been widely used in statistics, and also why it is particularly suited for rule induction, as shown for instance in  citation
MISC	this turns orthogonal transformations into useful tools for modeling regression problems and extracting knowledge from data
OWNX	thus they are worth a careful study as there are few available techniques for achieving this double objective, contrary to knowledge induction in classification problems
OWNX	in section , we recall how the original ols works
OWNX	section  introduces the learning criteria that will be used in our modified ols algorithm
OWNX	section  presents the modifications necessary to respect the interpretability constraints
OWNX	in the next section, the modified algorithm is applied to benchmark problems, compared to the original one and to reference results found in the literature
OWNX	a real-world application is presented and analyzed in section
OWNX	finally we give some conclusions and perspectives for future work
MISC	 multiple class labels
MISC	compared to traditional learning frameworks, the miml
MISC	 have multiple semantic meanings
OWNX	to learn from miml examples, we propose the
OWNX	considering that the degeneration process may lose information, we propose the
OWNX	moreover, we show that even when we do not have access to the real objects
MISC	 representation, miml is still useful
OWNX	we propose the \textsc{insdif} and
MISC	 \textsc{subcod} algorithms \textsc{insdif} works by transforming single-instances into
MISC	 the miml representation for learning, while \textsc{subcod} works by transforming
MISC	 in some tasks they are able to achieve better performance than learning the
MISC	 single-instances or single-label examples directly
MISC	in  traditional supervised learning , an object is represented by an instance,
MISC	 i e , a feature vector, and associated with a class label
MISC	 denote the instance space (or feature space) and  symbol  the set of class labels
MISC	the task is to learn a function  symbol  from a given data set
MISC	  symbol , where  symbol  is an instance and  symbol  is the known label of  symbol
MISC	although this formalization is prevailing and successful, there are many real-world
MISC	 framework belongs to only one concept and therefore the corresponding instance is
MISC	 associated with a single class label
MISC	however, many real-world objects are complicated,
MISC	 which may belong to multiple concepts simultaneously
MISC	for example, an image can belong
MISC	 to several classes simultaneously, eg ,  grasslands ,  lions ,
MISC	  africa , etc ; a text document can be classified to several categories if it is
MISC	 writing  or even  books on traveling ; a web page can be recognized as
MISC	  news page ,  sports page ,  soccer page , etc
MISC	in a specific real
MISC	 task, maybe only one of the multiple concepts is the right semantic meaning
MISC	 example, in image retrieval when a user is interested in an image with lions, s/he may
MISC	  grasslands  and  africa  associated with that image
MISC	the difficulty here
MISC	to choose the right semantic meaning for such objects for a specific scenario is the fundamental difficulty of many tasks
OWNX	in contrast to starting from a large universe of all possible concepts involved in the task, it may be helpful to get the subset of concepts associated with the concerned object at first, and then make a choice in the small subset later
MISC	however, getting the subset of concepts, that is, assigning proper class labels to such objects, is still a challenging task
OWNX	we notice that as an alternative to representing an object by a single instance, in
MISC	 many cases it is possible to represent a complicated object using a set of instances
MISC	for example, multiple patches can be extracted from an image where each patch is
OWNX	 multiple sections can be extracted from a document where each section is described by
MISC	 an instance, and thus the document can be represented by a set of instances; multiple
MISC	 thus the web page can be represented by a set of instances
MISC	using multiple instances to
MISC	 represent those complicated objects may be helpful because some inherent patterns which
MISC	 are closely related to some labels may become explicit and clearer
MISC	 multiple class labels
MISC	compared to traditional learning frameworks, the miml framework is more convenient
MISC	 and natural for representing complicated objects
OWNX	we propose the \textsc{mimlboost}
OWNX	 that the degeneration process may lose information, we also propose the
MISC	 each real object has already been represented by a single instance
MISC	thus, in such cases
OWNX	 we cannot capture more information from the real objects using the miml representation
MISC	even in this situation, however, miml is still useful
OWNX	we propose the \textsc{insdif}
MISC	 examples for learning
MISC	this algorithm is able to achieve a better performance than
MISC	 learning the single-instances directly in some tasks
MISC	this is not strange because for
MISC	 instance, the information corresponding to these labels are mixed and thus difficult
OWNX	 for learning; if we can transform the single-instance into a set of instances in some
MISC	 proper ways, the mixed information might be detached to some extent and thus less
MISC	 difficult for learning
OWNX	we propose the
MISC	 \textsc{subcod} (i e , sub-concept discovery) algorithm which works by discovering
MISC	 sub-concepts of the target concept at first and then transforming the data into miml
MISC	 examples for learning
MISC	this algorithm is able to achieve a better performance than
MISC	 learning the single-label examples directly in some tasks
MISC	this is also not strange
MISC	 because for a label corresponding to a high-level complicated concept, it may be quite
MISC	 difficult to learn this concept directly since many different lower-level concepts are
MISC	 mixed; if we can transform the single-label into a set of labels corresponding to some
OWNX	 sub-concepts, which are relatively clearer and easier for learning, we can learn these
MISC	 labels at first and then derive the high-level complicated label based on them with a
MISC	 less difficulty
OWNX	in section~, we review
MISC	 some related work
OWNX	in section~, we propose the miml framework
MISC	in
OWNX	 section~ we propose the \textsc{mimlboost} and \textsc{mimlsvm}
MISC	 algorithms, and apply them to tasks where the objects are represented as miml examples
OWNX	in section~ we present the \textsc{d-mimlsvm} algorithm and compare it
OWNX	 , we study the usefulness of miml when we do not have access to real
OWNX	concretely, in section~, we propose the \textsc{insdif}
OWNX	 directly; in section~ we propose the \textsc{subcod} algorithm and
MISC	using the game-theoretic framework for probability, vovk and shafer~ citation  have shown that it is always possible, using randomization, to make sequential probability forecasts that pass any countable set of well-behaved statistical tests
OWNX	we complement this result with a lower bound
OWNX	we show that vovk and shafer's result is valid only when the forecasts are computed with unrestrictedly increasing degree of accuracy
MISC	when some level of discreteness is fixed, we present a game-theoretic generalization of oakes' example for randomized forecasting that is a test failing any given method of deferministic forecasting; originally, this example was presented for deterministic calibration
MISC	using the game-theoretic framework for probability~ citation , vovk and shafer have shown in~ citation  that it is always possible, using randomization, to make sequential probability forecasts that pass any countable set of well-behaved statistical tests
MISC	this result generalizes work by other authors, among them are foster and vohra~ citation , kakade and foster~ citation , lehrer~ citation , sandrony et al ~ citation , who consider only tests of calibration
OWNX	we complement this result with a lower bound
OWNX	we show that vovk and shafer's result is valid only when the forecasts are computed with unrestrictedly increasing degree of accuracy
MISC	when some level of discreteness is fixed, we present a game-theoretic version of oakes' example for randomized forecasting that is a test failing any given method of deterministic forecasting; originally, this example was presented for deterministic calibration
MISC	to formulate this example, we use the forecasting game presented by vovk and shafer~ citation , namely binary forecasting game ii
OWNX	we discuss details of the randomized forecasting algorithms in section~
MISC	recognizing analogies, synonyms, anto\-nyms, and associations appear to be four distinct tasks, requiring distinct nlp algorithms
MISC	in the past, the four tasks have been treated independently, using a wide variety of algorithms
OWNX	these four semantic classes, however, are a tiny sample of the full range of semantic phenomena, and we cannot afford to create ad hoc algorithms for each semantic phenomenon; we need to seek a unified approach
OWNX	we propose to subsume a broad range of phenomena under analogies
OWNX	we introduce a supervised corpus-based machine learning algorithm for classifying analogous word pairs, and we show that it can solve multiple-choice sat analogy questions, toefl synonym questions, esl synonym-antonym questions, and similar-associated-both questions from cognitive psychology
MISC	a pair of words (petrify:stone) is  analogous  to another pair (vaporize:gas) when the semantic relations between the words in the first pair are highly similar to the relations in the second pair
MISC	two words (levied and imposed)  are  synonymous  in a context (levied a tax) when they can be interchanged (imposed a tax), they are are  antonymous  when they have opposite meanings (black and white), and they are  associated  when they tend to co-occur (doctor and hospital)
OWNX	on the surface, it appears that these are four distinct semantic classes, requiring distinct nlp algorithms, but we propose a uniform approach to all four
OWNX	we subsume synonyms, antonyms, and associations under analogies
MISC	there is past work on recognizing analogies  citation , synonyms  citation , antonyms  citation , and associations  citation , but each of these four tasks has been examined separately, in isolation from the others
OWNX	as far as we know, the algorithm proposed here is the first attempt to deal with all four tasks using a uniform approach
OWNX	however, we prefer to take a corpus-based approach to semantics
MISC	veale \shortcite{veale04} used wordnet to answer 374 multiple-choice sat analogy questions, achieving an accuracy of 43\%, but the best corpus-based approach attains an accuracy of 56\%  citation
MISC	another reason to prefer a corpus-based approach to a lexicon-based approach is that the former requires less human labour, and thus it is easier to extend to other languages
OWNX	in section~, we describe our algorithm for recognizing analogies
OWNX	we use a standard supervised machine learning approach, with feature vectors based on the frequencies of patterns in a large corpus
OWNX	we use a support vector machine (svm) to learn how to classify the feature vectors  citation
OWNX	section~ presents four sets of experiments
OWNX	we discuss the results of the experiments in section~
MISC	it performs well, although it is competing against specialized algorithms, developed for single tasks
OWNX	related work is examined in section~ and limitations and future work are considered in section~
OWNX	we conclude in section~
OWNX	by recasting the state discrimination problem within the framework of machine learning (ml), we can use the notion of learning reduction coming from classical ml to solve different variants of the classification task, such as the weighted binary and the multiclass versions
OWNX	in aaronson's model, we receive a finite number of copies of an unknown quantum state and the goal is, by ``training'' this state on a few povm's, to produce with high probability a hypothesis that can generalize with a reasonable accuracy on unobserved povm's belonging to this training dataset
OWNX	first, the model of performing learning in a quantum world is introduced in section~ along with the notion of learning reduction which allows us to relate together different learning tasks
OWNX	afterwards, in section~, the task of binary classification is described, and the weighted and multiclass versions of this task are defined respectively in sections~ and~
OWNX	finally, section~ concludes with a discussion
OWNX	we give a characterization of maximum entropy/minimum relative entropy inference by providing two `strong entropy concentration' theorems
OWNX	we then apply our theorems to establish the relationship between entropy concentration and a game-theoretic characterization of maximum entropy inference due to tops{\o}e and others
MISC	jaynes' maximum entropy (maxent) principle is a well-known principle for inductive inference  citation
MISC	it has been applied to statistical and machine learning problems ranging from protein modeling to stock market prediction  citation
MISC	one of its characterizations (some would say `justifications') is the so-called  concentration phenomenon\/   citation
MISC	here is an informal version of this phenomenon,  in the words of  citation :  for the case in which a prior distribution over the domain at hand is available,  citation  have proven the related  conditional limit theorem
OWNX	in sections~-, we provide a strong generalization of both the concentration phenomenon and the conditional limit theorem
MISC	in section~, the results of section~ are used to   extend an existing game-theoretic characterization (again, some would say ``justification'')  of maximum entropy due to  citation
AIMX	in this paper we bridge the gap with a general principle (phi) that identifies hypotheses with best predictive performance
MISC	this includes predictive point and interval estimation, simple and composite hypothesis testing, (mixture) model selection, and others as special cases
OWNX	for concrete instantiations we will recover well-known methods, variations thereof, and new ones
MISC	phi nicely justifies, reconciles, and blends (a reparametrization invariant variation of) map, ml, mdl, and moment estimation
MISC	one particular feature of phi is that it can genuinely deal with nested hypotheses
MISC	consider data  symbol  sampled from some distribution  symbol  with unknown  symbol
MISC	often this information needs to be summarized or simplified for various reasons (comprehensibility, communication, storage, computational efficiency, mathematical tractability, etc )
MISC	parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and model (complexity) selection can all be regarded as ways of summarizing this information, albeit in different ways or context
MISC	the posterior might either be summarized by a single point  symbol  (e g \ ml or map or mean or stochastic model selection), or by a convex set  symbol  (e g \ confidence or credible interval), or by a finite set of points  symbol  (mixture models) or a sample of points (particle filtering), or by the mean and covariance matrix (gaussian approximation), or by more general density estimation, or in a few other ways  citation
MISC	i have roughly sorted the methods in increasing order of complexity
OWNX	we will briefly comment on generalizations beyond set estimation at the end
MISC	there are many desirable properties any hypothesis identification principle ideally should satisfy
MISC	it should \parskip=0ex\parsep=0exsep=0ex  lead to good predictions (that's what models are ultimately for),  be broadly applicable,  be analytically and computationally tractable,  be defined and make sense also for non- iid  \ and non-stationary data,  be reparametrization and representation invariant,  work for simple and composite hypotheses,  work for classes containing nested and overlapping hypotheses,  work in the estimation, testing, and model selection regime,  reduce in special cases (approximately) to existing other methods
MISC	if  symbol  is the true parameter, then  symbol  is obviously the best prediction of the  symbol  future observations  symbol
OWNX	if we don't know  symbol  but have prior belief  symbol  about its distribution, the predictive distribution  symbol  based on the past  symbol  observations  symbol  (which averages the likelihood  symbol  over  symbol  with posterior weight  symbol ) is by definition the best bayesian predictor often we cannot use full bayes (for reasons discussed above) but predict with hypothesis  symbol , i e \ use  symbol  as prediction
OWNX	the closer  symbol  is to  symbol  or  symbol  the better is  symbol 's prediction (by definition), where we can measure closeness with some distance function  symbol
MISC	predictive hypothesis identification  (phi) minimizes the losses w r t \ some  hypothesis class   symbol
MISC	the general idea of inference by maximizing predictive performance is not new  citation
MISC	there are also a number of statistics papers on predictive inference; see  citation  for an overview and older references, and  citation  for newer references
MISC	most of them deal with distribution free methods based on some form of cross-validation discrepancy measure, and often focus on model selection
MISC	a notable exception is mlpd  citation , which maximizes the predictive likelihood including future observations
MISC	on the natural progression of estimation symbol prediction symbol action, approximating the predictive distribution by minimizing \req{lpt} lies between traditional parameter estimation and optimal decision making
MISC	formulation \req{lpt} is quite natural but i haven't seen it elsewhere
MISC	indeed, besides ideological similarities the papers above bear no resemblance to this work
OWNX	section  introduces notation, global assumptions, and illustrates phi on a simple example
MISC	this also shows a shortcoming of map and ml esimtation
OWNX	section  formally states phi, possible distance and loss functions, their minima, in section , i study exact properties of phi: invariances, sufficient statistics, and equivalences
OWNX	section  derives large sample approximations  symbol  for which phi reduces to sequential moment fitting (smf)
OWNX	section  contains summary, outlook and conclusions
MISC	the latter provides additional justification and support of previous principles, and clarifies their range of applicability
MISC	in general, the treatment is exemplary, not exhaustive
MISC	this is usually done through the penalization of predictor functions by  euclidean or hilbertian norms
OWNX	this framework is naturally applied to non linear variable selection; our extensive simulations on synthetic datasets and datasets from the uci repository show that efficiently exploring the large feature space through sparsity-inducing norms leads to state-of-the-art predictive performance
MISC	in the last two decades,  kernel methods have been a prolific  theoretical and algorithmic machine learning framework
MISC	by using appropriate regularization by hilbertian norms, representer theorems enable to consider large and potentially infinite-dimensional feature spaces while working within an implicit feature space no larger than the number of observations
MISC	this has led to numerous works on kernel design adapted to specific data types and generic kernel-based algorithms for many learning tasks (see, eg ,  citation )
MISC	regularization by sparsity-inducing norms, such as the  symbol -norm has also attracted a lot of interest in recent years
OWNX	more precisely, we consider a positive definite kernel that can be expressed as a large sum of positive definite  basis  or  local kernels
MISC	one major difficulty however is that the number of these smaller kernels is usually exponential in the dimension of the input space and applying multiple kernel learning directly in this decomposition would be intractable
OWNX	in order to peform selection efficiently, we make the extra assumption that these small kernels can be embedded in a  directed acyclic graph  (dag)
OWNX	following~ citation , we consider in \mysec{mkl} a specific combination of  symbol -norms that is adapted to the dag, and will restrict the authorized sparsity patterns; in our specific kernel framework, we are able to use the dag to design an optimization algorithm which has polynomial complexity in the number of selected kernels (\mysec{optimization})
OWNX	in simulations (\mysec{simulations}), we focus on   directed grids , where our framework allows to perform non-linear variable selection
OWNX	we provide extensive experimental validation of our novel regularization framework; in particular, we compare it to the regular  symbol -regularization and shows that it is always competitive and often leads to better performance, both on synthetic examples, and standard regression and classification datasets from the uci repository
OWNX	in particular, we show that our framework is adapted to estimating consistently only the  hull   of the relevant variables
OWNX	hence, by restricting the statistical power of our method, we gain computational efficiency
OWNX	we consider semi-supervised classification when part of the available data is unlabeled
OWNX	these unlabeled data can be useful for the classification problem when we make an assumption relating the behavior of the regression function to that of the marginal distribution
MISC	seeger  citation  proposed the well-known  cluster assumption  as a reasonable one
OWNX	we propose a mathematical formulation of this assumption and a method based on density level sets estimation that takes advantage of it to achieve fast rates of convergence both in the number of unlabeled examples and the number of labeled examples
MISC	\setcounter{equation}{0} semi-supervised classification has been of growing interest over the past few years and many methods have been proposed
MISC	''
MISC	unlabeled data can be used in different ways depending on the assumptions on the model
MISC	there are two types of assumptions
OWNX	the first one consists in assuming that we have a set of potential classifiers and we want to aggregate them
MISC	in that case, unlabeled data is used to measure the  compatibility  between the classifiers and reduces the complexity of the resulting classifier (see, eg ,  citation ,  citation )
OWNX	the second approach is the one that we use  here
MISC	this is the so-called  cluster assumption
MISC	this idea can be put in practice in several ways giving rise to various methods
MISC	most of these methods use hartigan's  citation  definition of clusters, namely the connected components of the density level sets
MISC	however, they use a parametric (usually mixture) model to estimate the underlying density which can be far from reality
MISC	in the same spirit,   citation  and  citation  propose methods that learn a distance using unlabeled data in order to have intra-cluster distances smaller than inter-clusters distances
MISC	the whole family of graph-based methods aims also at using unlabeled data to learn the distances between points
OWNX	finally, we mention kernel methods, where unlabeled data are used to build the kernel
MISC	recalling that the kernel measures proximity between points, such methods can also be viewed as learning a distance using unlabeled data (see  citation ,  citation ,  citation )
MISC	the cluster assumption can be interpreted in another way, i e , as the requirement that the decision boundary has to lie in low density regions
MISC	this interpretation has been widely used in learning since it can be used in the design of standard algorithms such as boosting  citation ,  citation  or svm  citation ,  citation , which are closely related to kernel methods mentioned above
MISC	in these algorithms, a greater penalization is given to decision boundaries that cross a cluster
MISC	for more details, see, eg ,  citation ,  citation ,  citation
OWNX	we also discuss what can and cannot be done using unlabeled data
OWNX	one of the conclusions is that considering the whole excess-risk is too ambitious and we need to concentrate on a smaller part of it to observe the improvement of semi-supervised classification over standard classification
OWNX	after describing the model, we formulate the cluster assumption and discuss why and how it can improve classification performance in the next section
OWNX	in section~, we study the population case when the marginal density  symbol  is known, to get an idea of our target
MISC	indeed, such a population case corresponds  in some way to the case when the amount of unlabeled data is infinite
OWNX	section~ contains the main result: we propose an algorithm for which we derive rates of convergence for the  symbol -thresholded excess-risk as a measure of performance
OWNX	section~ is devoted to discussion on the choice of  symbol   and possible improvements
OWNX	proofs of the results are gathered in section~
OWNX	we write  symbol  for the complement of the set  symbol
OWNX	thus, if  symbol , we have  symbol , for any  symbol
OWNX	{ we consider a general class of regularization methods which learn a vector of parameters on the basis of linear measurements
MISC	it is well known that if the regularizer is a nondecreasing function of the inner product then the learned vector is a linear combination of the input data
OWNX	we further extend our analysis to regularization methods which learn a matrix, a problem which is motivated by the application to multi-task learning
OWNX	in this context, we study a more general representer theorem, which holds for a larger class of regularizers
OWNX	we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for these class of matrix regularizers and highlight them with some concrete examples of practical importance
MISC	regularization in hilbert spaces is an important methodology for learning from examples and has a long history in a variety of fields
MISC	it has been studied, from different perspectives, in statistics  citation , in optimal estimation  citation  and recently has been a focus of attention in machine learning theory -- see, for example,  citation  and references therein
MISC	the regularizer plays an important role, in that it favors solutions with certain desirable properties
AIMX	in the first half of the paper, we describe a property which a regularizer should satisfy in order to give rise to a representer theorem
MISC	it turns out that this property has a simple geometric interpretation and that the regularizer can be equivalently expressed as a  nondecreasing  function of the hilbert space norm
OWNX	thus, we show that this condition, which has already been known to be sufficient for representer theorems, is also  necessary
OWNX	as we shall see, these matrix regularizers are important in the context of multi-task learning: the matrix columns are the parameters of different regression tasks and the regularizer encourages certain dependences across the tasks
OWNX	in general, we consider problems in the framework of  tikhonov regularization   citation
MISC	the optimization problems encountered in regularization are of the type \min\left\{ \bigl( \left( w,x_1\rb,\dots,w,x_m \right) , \left( y_1, \dots, y_m \right) \bigr) + \, \omega(w): w \right\} \,,   where  symbol  is a regularization parameter
MISC	the function  symbol  is called an  error function  and  symbol  is called a  regularizer
MISC	the error function measures the error on the data
MISC	typically, it decomposes as a sum of univariate functions
MISC	for example, in regression, a common choice would be the sum of square errors,  symbol
MISC	the function  symbol , called the regularizer, favors certain regularity properties of the vector  symbol  (such as a small norm) and can be chosen based on available prior information about the target vector
MISC	in some hilbert spaces such as sobolev spaces the regularizer is measure of smoothness: the smaller the norm the smoother the function
MISC	an important aspect of the practical success of this approach is the observation that, for certain choices of the regularizer, solving \eqref{eq:reg_intro} reduces to identifying  symbol  parameters and not  symbol
MISC	specifically, when the regularizer is the square of the hilbert space norm, the representer theorem holds: there exists a solution  symbol  of \eqref{eq:reg_intro} which is a linear combination of the input vectors,  {w} = \sum_{i=1}^m c_i x_i,   where  symbol  are some real coefficients
MISC	it is also known that it extends to any regularizer that is a  nondecreasing  function of the norm  citation
MISC	several other variants and results about the representation form \eqref{eq:rt} have also appeared in recent years  citation
MISC	moreover, the representer theorem has been important in machine learning, particularly within the context of learning in reproducing kernel hilbert spaces  citation  -- see  citation  and references therein
OWNX	our first objective in this paper is to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for representer theorems to hold
MISC	on the other side, though, the converse implication is true under certain weak qualifications on the error function
OWNX	that is, we provide a complete characterization of regularizers that give rise to representer theorems, which had been an open question
OWNX	furthermore, we discuss how our proof is motivated by a geometric understanding of the representer theorem, which is equivalently expressed as a monotonicity property of the regularizer
OWNX	our second objective is to formulate and study the novel question of representer theorems for  matrix problems
OWNX	to make our discussion concrete, let us consider the problem of learning  symbol  linear regression vectors, represented by the parameters  symbol , respectively
MISC	each vector can be thought of as a ``task'' and the goal is to  jointly  learn these  symbol  tasks
MISC	in such problems, there is usually prior knowledge that  relates  these tasks and it is often the case that learning can improve if this knowledge is appropriately taken into account
MISC	consequently, a good regularizer should favor such task relations and involve  all tasks jointly
MISC	each task   symbol  has its own input data  symbol  and corresponding  output values  symbol
OWNX	in fact, as we will discuss in section  , problems of the type \eqref{eq:matrix_intro} can be written in the form \eqref{eq:int_intro}
MISC	consequently, the representer theorem applies if the matrix regularizer is a nondecreasing function of the frobenius norm
MISC	moreover, with such regularizers it is easy to see that each task in \eqref{eq:matrix_intro} can be optimized independently
MISC	hence, these regularizers are of no practical interest if the tasks are expected to be related
OWNX	in other words, we now allow for  all input vectors  to be present in the linear combination representing each column of the optimal matrix
MISC	moreover, this framework can be applied to many applications where matrix optimization problems are involved
MISC	learning multiple tasks jointly has been a growing area of interest in machine learning, especially during the past few years  citation
MISC	this means that the tasks (the columns of  symbol ) are related in that they all lie in a low-dimensional subspace of  symbol
OWNX	in the case of the trace norm, the representer theorem \eqref{eq:rep_matrix_intro} is known to hold -- see  citation , also discussed in section
MISC	it is natural, therefore, to ask a question similar to that in the standard hilbert space (or single-task) setting
MISC	that is, under which conditions on the regularizer a representer theorem holds
OWNX	in section , we provide an answer by  proving a necessary and sufficient condition for representer theorems to hold, expressed as a simple monotonicity property
MISC	this property is analogous to the one in the hilbert space setting, but its geometric interpretation is now algebraic in nature
OWNX	we also give a functional description equivalent to this property, that is,  we show that the regularizers of interest are the matrix nondecreasing functions of the quantity  symbol
OWNX	our results cover matrix problems of the type \eqref{eq:matrix_intro} which have already been studied in the literature
MISC	but they also point towards some new learning methods that may perform well in practice and can now be made computationally efficient
OWNX	with previous known bound of  symbol  for  symbol  for the routing problem on trees with  symbol  vertices, we obtain an improved prediction algorithm for graphs with high effective resistance
OWNX	further more, our approach directly generalizes to the case where labels are not binary
MISC	the goal is to minimize the number of rounds that the algorithm makes a mistake, i e , rounds  symbol  such that  symbol
OWNX	to make our presentation clean, in this work we do not count the mistake made on the first question  symbol
MISC	this problem has been studied with standard online learning tools such as the perceptron algorithm
MISC	herbster, pontil, and wainer~ citation , and herbster and pontil~ citation  use pseudoinverse of graph laplacian as a kernel and provide a mistake bound that depends on the size of the cut induced by the partition based on the real labeling of vertices and the largest effective resistance between any pair of vertices in the graph
MISC	pelckmans and suykens~ citation  present a combinatorial algorithm for the problem that predicts a label of a given vertex based on known labels of its neighbors
MISC	they also prove a bound on the number of mistakes when the labels of adjacent vertices are known
MISC	however, their bound is very loose since it does not count every mistakes and their proof is still based on graph laplacian
OWNX	we shall compare the bound that we obtain with previous bounds of herbster  et
OWNX	we show connection between the prediction problem and the following online routing problem, first introduced by awerbuch and azar~ citation  in their study of online multicast routing
MISC	given a connected graph  symbol , the algorithm receives a sequence of requests  symbol , where  symbol , and, for each  symbol , where  symbol , has to route one unit of flow from  symbol  to some previous know  symbol  where  symbol
MISC	the algorithm works in an online fashion, i e , it has to return a route for  symbol  before receiving other requests  symbol , where  symbol
MISC	the performance of the algorithm is measured by the maximum congestion incurred on any edge
OWNX	in section~, we apply the known congestion bound to show the mistake bound for the graph prediction problem, and compare the bound obtained with the bounds from previous results
OWNX	we note that our approach directly generalizes to the case when labels are not binary (i e , when the labeling function  symbol  maps  symbol  to an arbitrary set  symbol  of labels) with the same mistake bound
MISC	in multi-task learning several related tasks are considered simultaneously, with the hope that by an appropriate sharing of information across tasks, each task may benefit from the others
MISC	in the context of learning linear functions for supervised classification or regression, this can be achieved by including a priori information about the weight vectors associated with the tasks, and how they are expected to be related to each other
OWNX	we design a new spectral norm that encodes this a priori assumption, without the prior knowledge of the partition of tasks into groups, resulting in a new convex optimization formulation for multi-task learning
OWNX	we show in simulations on synthetic examples and on the \textsc{iedb} mhc-i binding dataset, that our approach outperforms well-known convex methods for multi-task learning, as well as related non convex methods dedicated to the same problem
MISC	in particular, regularization by squared euclidean norms or squared hilbert norms has been thoroughly studied in various settings, leading to efficient practical algorithms based on linear algebra, and to very good theoretical understanding (see, eg ,  citation )
MISC	indeed, such norms can sometimes both make the problem statistically and numerically better-behaved, and impose various a priori knowledge on the problem
MISC	for example, the  symbol -norm (the sum of absolute values) imposes some of the components to be equal to zero and is widely used to estimate sparse functions~ citation , while various combinations of  symbol  norms can be defined to impose various sparsity patterns
MISC	in multi-task learning several related inference tasks are considered simultaneously, with the hope that by an appropriate sharing of information across tasks, each one may benefit from the others
MISC	when linear functions are estimated, each task is associated with a weight vector, and a common strategy to design multi-task learning algorithm is to translate some prior hypothesis about how the tasks are related to each other into constraints on the different weight vectors
MISC	for example, such constraints are typically that the weight vectors of the different tasks belong (a) to a euclidean ball centered at the origin~ citation , which implies no sharing of information between tasks apart from the size of the different vectors, i e , the amount of regularization, (b) to a ball of unknown center~ citation , which enforces a similarity between the different weight vectors, or (c) to an unknown low-dimensional subspace~ citation
MISC	an important situation that motivates this hypothesis is the case where most of the tasks are indeed related to each other, but a few ``outlier'' tasks are very different, in which case it may be better to impose similarity or low-dimensional constraints only to a subset of the tasks (thus forming a cluster) rather than to all tasks
MISC	another situation of interest is when one can expect a natural organization of the tasks into clusters, such as when one wants to model the preferences of customers and believes that there are a few general types of customers with similar preferences within each type, although one does not know beforehand which customers belong to which types
OWNX	in order to translate this hypothesis into a working algorithm, we follow the general strategy mentioned above which is to design a norm or a penalty over the set of weights which can be used as regularization in classical inference algorithms
OWNX	we then attempt to optimize the objective function of the inference algorithm over the set of partitions, a strategy that has proved useful in other contexts such as multiple kernel learning~ citation
OWNX	we introduce  algorithmic information theory , also known as the theory of  kolmogorov complexity
OWNX	we explain the main concepts of this quantitative approach to defining `information'
OWNX	we discuss the extent to which kolmogorov's and shannon's information theory have a common purpose, and where they are fundamentally different
OWNX	we end by discussing some of the philosophical implications of the theory
MISC	how should we measure the amount of information about a phenomenon that is given to us by an observation concerning the phenomenon
MISC	but whereas shannon's  theory considers description methods that are optimal relative to some given probability distribution, kolmogorov's algorithmic theory takes a different, nonprobabilistic approach: any computer program that first computes (prints) the string representing the observation, and then terminates, is viewed as a valid description
MISC	the amount of information in the string is then defined as the size (measured in bits) of the  shortest\/  computer program that outputs the string and then terminates
MISC	a similar definition can be given for infinite strings, but in this case the program produces element after element forever
MISC	thus, a long sequence of 1's such as  symbol } contains little information because a program of size about  symbol  bits outputs it:  symbol  symbol = 3 1415
MISC	
MISC	
MISC	symbol \pi$ forever)
MISC	such a definition would appear to make the amount of information in a string (or other object) depend on the particular programming language used
MISC	fortunately, it can be shown that all reasonable choices of programming languages lead to quantification of the amount of `absolute' information in individual objects that is invariant up to an additive constant
OWNX	we call this quantity the `kolmogorov complexity' of the object
MISC	while regular strings have small kolmogorov complexity, random strings have kolmogorov complexity about equal to their own length
MISC	measuring complexity and information in terms of program size has turned out to be a very powerful idea with applications in areas such as theoretical computer science, logic, probability theory, statistics and physics \paragraph{this chapter} kolmogorov complexity was introduced independently and with different motivations by r j solomonoff (born 1926), a n kolmogorov (1903--1987) and g
MISC	chaitin (born 1943) in 1960/1964, 1965 and 1966 respectively  citation
MISC	during the last forty years, the subject has developed into a major and mature area of research
OWNX	with the exception of the recent work on the kolmogorov structure function and parts of the discussion on philosophical implications, all material we discuss here can also be found in the standard textbook  citation
OWNX	the chapter is structured as follows: we start with an introductory section in which we define kolmogorov complexity and list its most important properties
OWNX	we do this in a much simplified (yet formally correct) manner, avoiding both technicalities and all questions of motivation (why this definition and not another one )
OWNX	the final section~, which discusses the theory's philosophical implications, as well as section~, which discusses the connection to inductive inference, are less technical again, and should perhaps be glossed over before delving into the technicalities of sections~--~
OWNX	we show how text from news articles can be used to predict intraday price movements of financial assets using support vector machines
OWNX	multiple kernel learning is used to combine equity returns with text as predictive features to increase classification performance and we develop an analytic center cutting plane method to solve the kernel learning problem efficiently
OWNX	we observe that while the direction of returns is not predictable using either text or returns, their size is, with text features producing significantly better performance than historical returns alone
MISC	asset pricing models often describe the arrival of novel information by a jump process, but the characteristics of the underlying jump process are only coarsely, if at all, related to the underlying source of information
MISC	similarly, time series models such as arch and garch have been developed to forecast volatility using asset returns data but these methods also ignore one key source of market volatility: financial news
MISC	empirical studies that examine stock return predictability can be traced back to  citation  among others, who showed that there is no significant autocorrelation in the daily returns of thirty stocks from the dow-jones industrial average
MISC	similar studies were conducted by  citation  and  citation , who find significant autocorrelation in squared and absolute returns (i e volatility)
MISC	these effects are also observed on intraday volatility patterns as demonstrated by  citation  and by  citation  on absolute returns
MISC	the impact of news articles has also been studied extensively
MISC	citation  for example studied price fluctuations in interest rate and foreign exchange futures markets following macroeconomic announcements and showed that prices mostly adjusted within one minute of major announcements
MISC	citation  aggregated daily announcements by  dow jones \& company  into a single variable and  found no correlation with market absolute returns and weak correlation with firm-specific absolute returns
MISC	however,  citation  aggregated intraday news concerning companies listed on the australian stock exchange into an exogenous variable in a garch model and found significant predictive power
MISC	these findings are attributed to the conditioning of volatility on news
MISC	the most common techniques for forecasting volatility are often based on autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (arch) and generalized arch (garch) models mentioned above
MISC	for example, intraday volatility in foreign exchange and equity markets is modeled with ma-garch in  citation  and arch in  citation
MISC	see  citation  for a survey of arch and garch models and various other applications
MISC	machine learning techniques such as neural networks and support vector machines have also been used to forecast volatility
MISC	neural networks are used in  citation  to forecast implied volatility of options on the sp100 index, and support vector machines are used to forecast volatility of the sp500 index using daily returns in  citation
OWNX	here, we show that information from press releases can be used to predict intraday abnormal returns with relatively high accuracy
MISC	we form a text classification problem where press releases are labeled positive if the absolute return jumps at some (fixed) time after the news is made public
OWNX	furthermore, we use multiple kernel learning (mkl) to optimally combine equity returns with text as predictive features and increase classification performance
MISC	text classification is a well-studied problem in machine learning, ( citation  and  citation  among many others show that svm significantly outperform classic methods such as naive bayes)
OWNX	initially, naive bayes classifiers were used in  citation  to do three-class classification of an index using daily returns for labels
MISC	news is taken from several sources such as  reuters  and  the wall street journal
MISC	text classification has also been used to directly predict volatility (see  citation  for a survey of trading systems that use text)
MISC	recently,  citation  used svm to predict if articles from the  bloomberg service  are followed by abnormally large volatility; articles deemed important are then aggregated into a variable and used in a garch model similar to  citation
MISC	they found that reports published after the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 improved forecasts over baseline methods that did not use text
MISC	generating trading rules with genetic programming (gp) is another way to incorporate text for financial trading systems
MISC	trading rules are created in  citation  using gp for foreign exchange markets based on technical indicators and extended in  citation  to combine technical indicators with non-publicly available information
MISC	ensemble methods were used in  citation  on top of gp to create rules based on headlines posted on  yahoo  internet message boards
OWNX	our contribution here is twofold
MISC	they consider a nine months subset of the eight years of press releases used here
OWNX	our experiments analyze predictability of absolute returns at many horizons and demonstrate significant initial intraday predictability that decreases throughout the trading day
OWNX	second, we optimally combine text information with asset price time series to significantly enhance classification performance using multiple kernel learning (mkl)
OWNX	we use an analytic center cutting plane method (accpm) to solve the resulting mkl problem
MISC	accpm is particularly efficient on problems where the objective function and gradient are hard to evaluate but whose feasible set is simple enough so that analytic centers can be computed efficiently
MISC	furthermore, because it does not suffer from conditioning issues, accpm can achieve higher precision targets than other first-order methods
OWNX	section  details the text classification problem we solve here and provides predictability results using using either text or absolute returns as features
OWNX	section  describes the multiple kernel learning framework and details the analytic center cutting plane algorithm used to solve the resulting optimization problem
OWNX	finally, we use mkl to enhance the prediction performance
AIMX	this paper generalizes the traditional statistical concept of prediction intervals for arbitrary probability density functions in high-dimen\-sional feature spaces by introducing significance level distributions, which provides interval-independent probabilities for continuous random variables
OWNX	the advantage of the transformation of a probability density function into a significance level distribution is that it enables one-class classification or outlier detection in a direct manner
MISC	the appeal of this concept is its clear stochastic meaning
MISC	the great disadvantage is that this definition is usually too restricted, for example for multimodal distributions
MISC	it is intuitively clear that, in this case, more than one interval for probable feature vectors can exist and it would be better to speak of prediction  regions
MISC	this lack of generality is probably the reason why prediction intervals are rarely used in pattern recognition
MISC	instead of prediction intervals, numerous other methods are used for this purpose
OWNX	if applying the method i propose here to outlier detection, it belongs to the first category with a probability as normality score
MISC	simple distance-based methods rely on the concept of the neighborhood of a point, for example, the  symbol  nearest neighborhood  citation
MISC	the idea is to consider as outliers the set of points with the highest distances to their  symbol th nearest neighbors
MISC	of course, here is also a threshold necessary, but it has now a statistical reasoning as quartile of the  symbol th nearest neighbor distance distribution, which simplifies the choice
MISC	a more recent article based on this idea is published by  citation , who apply a weighted sum of the  symbol th nearest distances per point
MISC	although the idea is quite simple, the methods have low computation costs
MISC	furthermore, they make only minor assumptions about the underlying distribution
OWNX	another category of algorithms that are related to outlier detection is robust regression
OWNX	the outlier detection is here more a means to an end, because the goal is to avoid that outliers influence the estimation of the regression function
MISC	citation , for example, apply an outlier-score to control the influence that a point has in the parameter estimation process of the regression function
MISC	for this purpose, weights are introduced, which are estimated based on the assumption that the noise is gaussian distributed
MISC	this is often sufficient, for example for most sensor signals
MISC	the algorithm is real-time capable, but far away from generality
MISC	this method also belongs to category one
MISC	the idea of the second category is very different
MISC	at the first glance, it seems to be impossible to use classifiers to detect outliers, because classifiers need for the estimation of their parameters samples from inliers  and  outliers
MISC	usually, only samples for inliers are available
MISC	the idea is to create a enclosing cloud of outlier samples synthetically with a random generator
MISC	afterwards, it is possible to train the classifier
MISC	citation , for example, apply a neural network for this purpose
MISC	other classifiers are also possible, for example, an svm  citation
MISC	citation , for example, use for this purpose simple prediction intervals ( symbol  ranges)
MISC	in conclusion, both categories have to solve the same problem: to find an appropriate zero level set for the inlier generating density
MISC	models for near-rigid shape matching are typically based on distance-related features, in order to infer matches that are consistent with the isometric assumption
AIMX	in this paper, we introduce a graphical model that parameterises appearance, distance, and angle features and we learn all of the involved parameters via structured prediction
MISC	the outcome is a model for near-rigid shape matching which is  robust  in the sense that it is able to capture the possibly limited but still important scale and appearance variations
MISC	matching shapes in images has many applications, including image retrieval, alignment, and registration  citation
MISC	typically, matching is approached by selecting features for a set of landmark points in both images; a correspondence between the two is then chosen such that some distance measure between these features is minimised
MISC	a great deal of attention has been devoted to defining complex features which are robust to changes in rotation, scale etc
MISC	citation
MISC	an important class of matching problems is that of  near-isometric  shape matching
MISC	in this setting, it is assumed that shapes are defined up to an isometric transformation (allowing for some noise), and therefore distance features are typically used to encode the shape
MISC	some traditional methods for related settings focus on optimisation over the space of rigid transformations so as to minimise least-squares criteria  citation
MISC	recently, this class of problems has been approached from a different perspective, as direct optimisation over the space of correspondences  citation
MISC	although apparently more expensive, there it is shown that the rigidity assumption imposes a convenient algebraic structure in the correspondence space so as to allow for efficient algorithms (exact inference in chordal graphical models of small clique size)
MISC	more recently, these methods have been made substantially faster  citation
MISC	the  key idea  in these methods is to  explicitly encode rigidity constraints  into a tractable graphical model whose map solution corresponds to the best match
MISC	other lines of work that optimise directly over the correspondence space are those based on graph matching, which explicitly model all pairwise compatibilities and solve for the best match with some  relaxation  (since the graph matching problem is np-hard for general pairwise compatibilities)  citation
MISC	recently, it was shown both in  citation  and in  citation  that if some form of  structured optimisation  is used to optimise graph matching scores, relaxed quadratic assignment predictors can improve the power of pairwise features
MISC	the  key idea  in these methods is to  learn the compatibility scores  for the graph matching objective function, therefore enriching the representability of features
OWNX	we produce an exact, efficient model to solve near-isometric shape matching problems using not only isometry-invariant features, but also appearance and scale-invariant features, all encoded in a  tractable graphical model
OWNX	by doing so we can  learn via large-margin structured prediction  the relative importances of variations in appearance and scale with regard to variations in shape  per se
OWNX	therefore, even knowing that we are in a near-isometric setting, we will still capture the eventual variations in appearance and scale into our matching criterion in order to produce a  robust  near-isometric matcher
OWNX	in section , we present our model, and experiments follow in section

OWNX	we present an algorithm for  learning  an hmm from single or
MISC	the traditional approach for
MISC	 learning an hmm is the baum-welch algorithm~ citation 
MISC	 which has been extended in a variety of ways by others

MISC	recently, a novel and promising approach to the hmm approximation

OWNX	we consider the task of learning a classifier from the feature space  symbol  to the set of classes  symbol , when the features can be partitioned into class-conditionally independent feature sets  symbol  and  symbol
OWNX	we show the surprising fact that the class-conditional independence can be used to represent the original learning task in terms of 1) learning a classifier from  symbol  to  symbol  and 2) learning the class-conditional distribution of the feature set  symbol
OWNX	we present experimental evaluation of the idea in two real world applications
MISC	semi-supervised learning is said to occur when the learner exploits (a presumably large quantity of) unlabeled data to supplement a relatively small labeled sample, for accurate induction
MISC	the high cost of labeled data and the simultaneous plenitude of unlabeled data in many application domains, has led to considerable interest in semi-supervised learning in recent years
OWNX	we show a somewhat surprising consequence of class-conditional feature independence that leads to a simple semi-supervised learning algorithm
OWNX	when the feature set can be partitioned into two class-conditionally independent sets, we show that the original learning problem can be reformulated in terms of the problem of learning a predictor from  one  of the partitions to the other
MISC	that is, the latter partition acts as a  surrogate  for the class variable
MISC	since such a predictor can be learned from only unlabeled samples, an effective semi-supervised algorithm results
OWNX	in the next section we present the simple yet interesting result on which our semi-supervised learning algorithm (which we call  surrogate learning ) is based
OWNX	we present examples to clarify the intuition behind the approach and present a special case of our approach that is used in the applications section
OWNX	we present empirical evaluation on two real world applications where the required assumptions of our algorithm are satisfied
MISC	while the performance of bandit algorithms with a small finite strategy set is quite well understood, bandit problems with large strategy sets are still a topic of very active investigation, motivated by practical applications such as online auctions and web advertisement
MISC	the goal of such research is to identify broad and natural classes of strategy sets and payoff functions which enable the design of efficient solutions
OWNX	in this work we study a very general setting for the multi-armed bandit problem in which the strategies form a metric space, and the payoff function satisfies a lipschitz condition with respect to the metric
OWNX	we refer to this problem as the  lipschitz mab problem
OWNX	we present a solution for the multi-armed problem in this setting
OWNX	that is, for every metric space  symbol  we define an isometry invariant  symbol  which bounds from below the performance of lipschitz mab algorithms for  symbol , and we present an algorithm which comes arbitrarily close to meeting this bound
OWNX	furthermore, our technique gives even better results for benign payoff functions
MISC	\newcommand{\willcite}[1][cite]{{[#1]}}  in a multi-armed bandit problem, an online algorithm must choose from a set of strategies in a sequence of  symbol  trials so as to maximize the total payoff of the chosen strategies
MISC	these problems are the principal theoretical tool for modeling the exploration/exploitation tradeoffs inherent in  sequential decision-making under uncertainty
MISC	studied intensively for the last three decades~ citation , bandit problems are having an increasingly visible impact on computer science because of their diverse applications including online auctions, adaptive routing, and the theory of learning in games
MISC	the performance of a multi-armed bandit algorithm is often evaluated in terms of its  regret , defined as the gap between the expected payoff of the algorithm and that of an optimal strategy
MISC	while the performance of bandit algorithms with a small finite strategy set is quite well understood, bandit problems with exponentially or infinitely large strategy sets are still a topic of very active investigation~ citation
MISC	absent any assumptions about the strategies and their payoffs, bandit problems with large strategy sets allow for no non-trivial solutions --- any multi-armed bandit algorithm performs as badly, on some inputs, as random guessing
MISC	but in most applications it is natural to assume a structured class of payoff functions, which often enables the design of efficient learning algorithms~ citation
AIMX	in this paper, we consider a broad and natural class of problems in which the structure is induced by a metric on the space of strategies
MISC	while bandit problems have been studied in a few specific metric spaces (such as a one-dimensional interval) ~ citation , the case of general metric spaces has not been treated before, despite being an extremely natural setting for bandit problems
MISC	independently experimenting with each advertisement is infeasible, or at least highly inefficient, since the number of ads is too large
MISC	instead, the advertisements are usually organized into a taxonomy based on metadata (such as the category of product being advertised) which allows a similarity measure to be defined
OWNX	abstractly, we have a bandit problem of the following form: there is a strategy set  symbol , with an unknown payoff function  symbol  satisfying a set of predefined constraints of the form  symbol  for some  symbol  and  symbol
MISC	specifically, if  symbol  is defined to be the infimum, over all finite sequences  symbol  in  symbol , of the quantity  symbol , then  symbol  is a metric and the constraints  symbol  may be summarized by stating that  symbol  is a lipschitz function (of lipschitz constant  symbol ) on the metric space  symbol
OWNX	we refer to this problem as the  lipschitz mab problem  on  symbol , and we refer to the ordered triple  symbol  as an  instance  of the lipschitz mab problem \xhdr{prior work }  while our work is the first to treat the lipschitz mab problem in general metric spaces, special cases of the problem are implicit in prior work on the continuum-armed bandit problem~ citation  --- which corresponds to the space  symbol  under the metric  symbol ,  symbol  --- and the experimental work on ``bandits for taxonomies''~ citation , which corresponds to the case in which  symbol  is a tree metric
MISC	the latter quantity is the expected payoff of always playing a strategy  symbol  if such strategy exists \omit{ %%%%%%%%%%%% for any  symbol , there is an algorithm  symbol  for the lipschitz mab problem on  symbol  whose regret on any instance  symbol  satisfies  symbol  for any  symbol  there does not exist an algorithm  symbol  for the lipschitz mab problem on  symbol  which satisfies  symbol  for every  symbol  and every instance  symbol  } %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  in fact, if the time horizon  symbol  is known in advance, the upper bound in the theorem can be achieved by an extremely na\"{i}ve algorithm which simply uses an optimal  symbol -armed bandit algorithm (such as the \textsc{ucb1} algorithm~ citation ) to choose strategies from the set  symbol , for a suitable choice of the parameter  symbol
MISC	in particular, the algorithm approximates the strategy set by a fixed mesh  symbol  and does not refine this mesh as it gains information about the location of the optimal strategy
MISC	a closer examination of the lower bound proof raises further reasons for suspicion: it is based on a contrived, highly singular payoff function  symbol  that alternates between being constant on some distance scales and being very steep on other (much smaller) distance scales, to create a multi-scale ``needle in haystack'' phenomenon which nearly obliterates the usefulness of the proximity information contained in the metric  symbol

MISC	if there is a unique optimal strategy that lies in the low-dimensional part  symbol  then the zooming dimension is bounded above by the covering dimension of  symbol , whereas the ``global'' covering dimension is that of  symbol
MISC	then the zooming dimension is equal to the covering dimension of  symbol , eg it is  symbol  if  symbol  is a finite point set { %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

OWNX	than the local covering dimension at the point  symbol  where  symbol  is maximized } %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%     \xhdr{discussion } in stating the theorems above, we have been imprecise about specifying the model of computation
OWNX	in particular, we have ignored the thorny issue of how to provide an algorithm with an input containing a metric space which may have an infinite number of points
OWNX	all of our theorems are valid under this interpretation, but they can also be made into precise algorithmic results provided that the algorithm is given appropriate oracle access to the metric space
OWNX	we refer to this setting as the \standardmab
MISC	for example, the zooming algorithm uses only a covering oracle for  symbol , and requires only one oracle query per round (with at most  symbol  balls in round  symbol )
OWNX	however, the per-metric optimal algorithm in theorem~  uses more complicated oracles, and we defer the definition of these oracles to section~ \omit{ %%%%%% the algorithm is very efficient, requiring only  symbol  operations in total (including oracle queries) to choose its first  symbol  strategies \bobbynote{prove the  symbol  bound in "body" } } %%%%%  while our definitions and results so far have been tailored for the lipschitz mab problem on infinite metrics, some of them can be extended to the finite case as well
OWNX	in particular, for the zooming algorithm we obtain sharp results (that are meaningful for both finite and infinite metrics) using a more precise,  non-asymptotic  version of the zooming dimension
OWNX	extending the notions in theorem~ to the finite case is an open question \omit{ while our definitions and results so far have been tailored for the lipschitz mab problem on infinite metrics, they can be extended to the finite case as well
OWNX	in particular, for the zooming algorithm we obtain sharp results (that are meaningful for both finite and infinite metrics) using a more precise,  non-asymptotic  version of the zooming dimension
OWNX	extending the notions in theorem~ to the finite case is feasible but more complicated; we leave it to the full version } %%%    \xhdr{extensions } we provide a number of extensions in which we elaborate on our analysis of the zooming algorithm
OWNX	first, we provide sharper bounds for several examples in which the reward from playing each strategy  symbol  is  symbol  plus an independent  noise  of a known and ``benign" shape
OWNX	third, we apply this result to a version where  symbol  for some  target set   symbol  which is not revealed to the algorithm
OWNX	fourth, we relax some assumptions in the analysis of the zooming algorithm, and use this generalization to analyze the version in which  symbol  for some known function  symbol
OWNX	we follow this motivation further in appendix~ and consider a multi-round game such that in each round an adversary selects a webpage and the algorithm selects an ad which it places on this webpage
MISC	although the algorithm is based in the ``na\"{i}ve'' algorithm from theorem~, the adversarial aspect of the problem creates considerable technical challenges
OWNX	in future work we hope to pursue more refined guarantees in the style of section~ }  \omit{ %%%%%%%%% ideally, it would be desirable to have a matching lower bound constituting a  per-instance optimality  guarantee for the zooming algorithm or some other algorithm
MISC	for any given instance  symbol , if  symbol  is a point where  symbol  achieves its maximum, then the algorithm which always plays strategy  symbol  has zero regret
MISC	nevertheless, one might hope for a subtler characterization of per-instance optimality, eg asserting that no algorithm can outperform  symbol  on one instance  symbol  without performing significantly worse than  symbol  on highly similar instances  symbol
OWNX	following the publication of the conference version, this question has been settled in~ citation , revealing the following dichotomy: for every metric space, the optimal regret of a lipschitz mab algorithm is either bounded above by any  symbol , or bounded below by any  symbol , depending on whether the completion of the metric space is compact and countable
OWNX	we discuss in breadth how and in which sense universal (non- iid  )\ sequence prediction solves various (philosophical) problems of traditional bayesian sequence prediction
MISC	it even performs well (actually better) in non-computable environments
MISC	given the weather in the past, what is the probability of rain tomorrow
MISC	given historic stock-charts, can one predict the quotes of tomorrow
MISC	assuming the sun rose 5000 years every day, how likely is doomsday (that the sun does not rise) tomorrow
MISC	these are instances of the important problem of inductive inference or time-series forecasting or sequence prediction
MISC	finding prediction rules for every particular (new) problem is possible but cumbersome and prone to disagreement or contradiction
MISC	the bayesian framework is the most consistent and successful framework developed thus far  citation
MISC	in a predictive setting, one directly determines the predictive probability of the next symbol  symbol  without the intermediate step of identifying a (true or good or causal or useful) model
MISC	note that classification and regression can be regarded as special sequence prediction problems, where the sequence  symbol  of  symbol -pairs is given and the class label or function value  symbol  shall be predicted
MISC	solomonoff's  citation  rigorous, essentially unique, formal, and universal solution to this problem is to consider a single large universal class  symbol  suitable for  all  induction problems
MISC	the corresponding universal prior  symbol  is biased towards simple environments in such a way that it dominates=\-superior to all other priors
MISC	this leads to an a priori probability  symbol  which is equivalent to the probability that a universal turing machine with random input tape outputs  symbol
MISC	many interesting, important, and deep results have been proven for solomonoff's universal distribution  symbol   citation
AIMX	the motivation and goal of this paper is to provide a broad discussion of how and in which sense universal sequence prediction solves all kinds of (philosophical) problems of bayesian sequence prediction, and to present some recent results
MISC	i hope that the exposition stimulates such a future, more detailed, investigation
OWNX	in section  we review the excellent predictive performance of bayesian sequence prediction for generic (non- iid  )\ countable and continuous model classes
OWNX	section  critically reviews the classical principles (indifference, symmetry, minimax) for obtaining objective priors, introduces the universal prior inspired by occam's razor and quantified in terms of kolmogorov complexity
OWNX	in section  (for  iid  \  symbol ) and section  (for universal  symbol ) we show various desirable properties of the universal prior and class (non-zero p(oste)rior, confirmation of universal hypotheses, reparametrization and regrouping invariance, no old-evidence and updating problem) in contrast to (most) classical continuous prior densities
OWNX	finally, we show that the universal mixture performs better than classical continuous mixtures, even in uncomputable environments
OWNX	section  contains critique and summary
MISC	no statistical information about the primary traffic is assumed to be available  a-priori  to the secondary user
OWNX	we investigate two distinct sensing scenarios
OWNX	in both cases, we propose mac protocols that efficiently learn the statistics of the primary traffic on-line
OWNX	our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed blind protocols asymptotically achieve the throughput obtained when prior knowledge of primary traffic statistics is available
MISC	most of licensed spectrum resources are under-utilized
MISC	this observation has encouraged the emergence of dynamic and opportunistic spectrum access concepts, where unlicensed (secondary) users equipped with cognitive radios are allowed to opportunistically access the spectrum as long as they do not interfere with licensed (primary) users
MISC	to achieve this goal, secondary users must monitor the primary traffic in order to identify spectrum holes or opportunities which can be exploited to transfer data~ citation
MISC	specifically, the cognitive mac protocol should continuously make efficient decisions on which channels to sense and access in order to obtain the most benefit from the available spectrum opportunities
MISC	several cognitive mac protocols have been proposed in previous studies
MISC	on the other hand,~ citation  proposed a sensing-period optimization mechanism and an optimal channel-sequencing algorithm, as well as an environment adaptive channel-usage pattern estimation method
MISC	the slotted markovian structure for the primary network traffic, adopted here, was also considered in~ citation  where the optimal policy was characterized and a simple greedy policy for secondary users was constructed
OWNX	here, our focus is on the blind scenario where the cognitive mac protocol must learn the transition probabilities on-line
OWNX	in this work, we differentiate between two scenarios
MISC	the first assumes that the secondary transmitter can sense all the available primary channels before making the decision on which one to access
MISC	the secondary receiver, however, does not participate in the sensing process and can  wait to decode  on only one channel
OWNX	in the sequel, we propose an efficient algorithm that optimizes the on-line learning capabilities of the secondary transmitter and ensures perfect synchronization between the secondary pair
MISC	the proposed protocol does not assume a separate control channel, and hence, piggybacks the synchronization information on the same data packet
MISC	this problem can be re-casted as a restless multi-armed bandit problem where the optimal algorithm must strike a balance between exploration and exploitation~ citation
MISC	unfortunately, finding the optimal solution for this problem remains an elusive task~ citation
MISC	building an svm entails solving a constrained convex quadratic programming problem, which is quadratic in the number of training samples
OWNX	we introduce an efficient parallel implementation of an support vector regression solver, based on the gaussian belief propagation algorithm (gabp)
AIMX	in this paper, we demonstrate that methods from the complex system domain could be utilized for performing efficient distributed computation
OWNX	we compare the proposed algorithm to previously proposed distributed and single-node svm solvers
OWNX	our comparison shows that the proposed algorithm is just as accurate as these solvers, while being significantly faster, especially for large datasets
OWNX	we demonstrate scalability of the proposed algorithm to up to 1,024 computing nodes and hundreds of thousands of data points using an ibm blue gene supercomputer
MISC	support-vector machines (svms) are a class of algorithms that have, in recent years, exhibited superior performance compared to other pattern classification algorithms
MISC	there are several formulations of the svm problem, depending on the specific application of the svm (e g , classification, regression, etc )
MISC	one of the difficulties in using svms is that building an svm requires solving a constrained quadratic programming problem, whose size is quadratic in the number of training examples
MISC	this fact has led to extensive research on efficient svm solvers
MISC	recently, several researchers have suggested using multiple computing nodes in order to increase the computational power available for solving svms
OWNX	in this article, we introduce a distributed svm solver based on the gaussian belief propagation (gabp) algorithm
OWNX	using our novel construction, we demonstrate that the algorithm exhibits very good performance for dense matrices as well
MISC	the repeatability and efficiency of a corner detector determines how likely it is to be useful in a real-world application
MISC	the repeatability is importand because the same scene viewed from different positions should yield features which correspond to the same real-world 3d locations~ citation
MISC	the efficiency is important because this determines whether the detector combined with further processing can operate at frame rate
OWNX	first, we present a new heuristic for feature detection, and using machine learning we derive a feature detector from this which can fully process live pal video using  less than 5\%  of the available processing time
MISC	by comparison, most other detectors cannot even operate at frame rate (harris detector 115\%, sift 195\%)
OWNX	second, we generalize the detector, allowing it to be optimized for repeatability, with little loss of efficiency
MISC	this need has driven the development of a large number of corner detectors
MISC	the amount of variation in viewpoint under which this condition should hold depends on the application
OWNX	algorithms participating in the challenge are required to assign score values to  search results for a collection of queries, and are measured using standard ir ranking measures (ndcg, precision, map) that depend only the relative score-induced order of the results
OWNX	similarly to many of the ideas proposed in the participating algorithms, we train a linear classifier
OWNX	in contrast with other participating algorithms, we define an additional free variable (intercept, or benchmark) for each query
MISC	this allows expressing the fact that results for different queries are incomparable for the purpose of determining relevance
MISC	the cost of this idea is the addition of relatively few nuisance parameters
OWNX	our approach is simple,  and we used  a standard logistic regression library to test it
OWNX	the results beat the reported participating algorithms
MISC	microsoft
OWNX	algorithms participating in the challenge are required to assign score values to  search results for a collection of queries, and are measured using standard ir ranking measures (ndcg@ symbol , precision@ symbol  and map - see  citation  for details), designed in such a way that only the relative order of the results matters
MISC	the input to the learning problem is a list of query-result records, where each record is a vector of standard ir features together with a relevance label and a query id
MISC	the label is either binary (irrelevant or relevant) or trinary (irrelevant, relevant or very relevant)
MISC	the rationale is that the ir measures are computed as a sum over the queries, where for each query  a nonlinear function is computed
MISC	for example, ranksvm  citation  and rankboost  citation  use pairs of results for the same query to penalize a cost function, but never cross-query pairs of results
MISC	the following approach seems at first too naive compared to others: since the training  information is given as relevance labels, why not simply train a linear classifier to predict the relevance labels, and use prediction confidence  as score
MISC	unfortunately this approach fares poorly
MISC	the hypothesized reason is that judges' relevance response may depend on the query
OWNX	to check this hypothesis, we define an additional free variable ( intercept  or  benchmark ) for each query
MISC	this allows expressing the fact that results for different queries are incomparable for the purpose of determining relevance
MISC	the cost of this idea is the addition of relatively few nuisance parameters
OWNX	our approach is extremely simple, and we used a standard logistic regression library to test it on the data
MISC	this work is not the first to suggest query dependent ranking, but it is arguably the simplest, most immediate way to address this dependence using linear classification before other complicated ideas should be tested
OWNX	based on our judgment, other reported algorithms used for the challenge are more complicated, and our solution is overall better on the given data
MISC	the exploration-exploitation dilemma has been an intriguing and unsolved problem within the framework of reinforcement learning ``optimism in the face of uncertainty'' and model building play central roles in advanced exploration methods
OWNX	here, we integrate several concepts and obtain a fast and simple algorithm
OWNX	we show that the proposed algorithm finds a near-optimal policy in polynomial time, and give experimental evidence that it is robust and efficient compared to its ascendants
MISC	reinforcement learning (rl) is the art of maximizing long-term rewards in a stochastic, unknown environment
MISC	while simple methods like  symbol -greedy and boltzmann exploration are commonly used, it is known that their behavior can be extremely poor  citation
MISC	recently, a number of efficient exploration algorithms have been published, and for some of them, formal proofs of efficiency also exist
OWNX	we review these methods in section~
OWNX	the new algorithm,  optimistic initial model  (\ourmethod), is described in section~
OWNX	in section~, we show that many of the advanced algorithms, including ours, can be treated in a unified way
OWNX	we use this fact to sketch a proof that \ourmethod\ finds a near-optimal policy in polynomial time with high probability
OWNX	section~ provides experimental comparison between \ourmethod\ and a number of other methods on some benchmark problems
OWNX	our results are summarized in section~
OWNX	in the rest of this section, we review the necessary preliminaries, markov decision processes and the exploration task
MISC	%
MISC	if the agent is a passive observer, then the optimal solution is the well-known bayesian predictor
MISC	however, if the agent is active, then its past actions need to be treated as causal interventions on the i/o stream rather than normal probability conditions
MISC	here it is shown that the solution to this new variational problem is given by a stochastic controller called the bayesian control rule, which implements adaptive behavior as a mixture of experts
MISC	instances of this problem include hitting a target with a cannon under known weather conditions, solving a maze having its map and controlling a robotic arm in a manufacturing plant
MISC	however, when the behavior of the plant is unknown, then the designer faces the problem of  adaptive control
MISC	for example, shooting the cannon lacking the appropriate measurement equipment, finding the way out of an unknown maze and designing an autonomous robot for martian exploration
MISC	adaptive control turns out to be far more difficult than its non-adaptive counterpart
MISC	this is because any good policy has to carefully trade off explorative versus exploitative actions, i e actions for the identification of the environment's dynamics versus actions to control it in a desired way
MISC	even when the environment's dynamics are known to belong to a particular class for which optimal agents are available, constructing the corresponding optimal adaptive agent is in general computationally intractable even for simple toy problems  citation
MISC	thus, finding tractable approximations has been a major focus of research
MISC	for example, a large class of optimal control problems can be solved very efficiently if the problem statement is reformulated as the minimization of the deviation of the dynamics of a controlled system from the uncontrolled system  citation
MISC	in this work, a similar approach is introduced
MISC	if a class of agents is given, where each agent solves a different environment, then adaptive controllers can be derived from a minimum relative entropy principle
MISC	however, this extension is not straightforward
MISC	there is a syntactical difference between actions and observations that has to be taken into account when formulating the variational problem
MISC	more specifically, actions have to be treated as interventions obeying the rules of causality  citation
MISC	if this distinction is made, the variational problem has a unique solution given by a stochastic control rule called the bayesian control rule
MISC	this control rule is particularly interesting because it translates the adaptive control problem into an on-line inference problem that can be applied forward in time
OWNX	section~ introduces notation and sets up the adaptive control problem
OWNX	section~ formulates adaptive control as a minimum relative entropy problem
MISC	after an initial, na\"{\i}ve approach, the need for causal considerations is motivated
OWNX	in section~, the conditions for convergence are examined and a proof is given
OWNX	section~ illustrates the usage of the bayesian control rule for the multi-armed bandit problem and the undiscounted markov decision problem
OWNX	section~ discusses properties of the bayesian control rule and relates it to previous work in the literature
OWNX	section~ concludes
OWNX	the key approaches for machine learning, especially learning in unknown probabilistic environments are new representations and computation mechanisms
MISC	the state (action) set can be represented with a quantum superposition state and the eigen state (eigen action) can be obtained by randomly observing the simulated quantum state according to the collapse postulate of quantum measurement
MISC	the probability of the eigen action is determined by the probability amplitude, which is parallelly updated according to rewards
MISC	some related characteristics of qrl such as convergence, optimality and balancing between exploration and exploitation are also analyzed, which shows that this approach makes a good tradeoff between exploration and exploitation using the probability amplitude and can speed up learning through the quantum parallelism
OWNX	to evaluate the performance and practicability of qrl, several simulated experiments are given and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of qrl algorithm for some complex problems
MISC	the present work is also an effective exploration on the application of quantum computation to artificial intelligence
MISC	\parstart{l}{earning} methods are generally classified into supervised, unsupervised and  reinforcement learning  (rl)
MISC	supervised learning requires explicit feedback provided by input-output pairs and gives a map from inputs to outputs
MISC	in contrast, rl uses a scalar value named  reward  to evaluate the input-output pairs and learns a mapping from  states  to  actions  by interaction with the environment through trial-and-error
MISC	since 1980s, rl has become an important approach to machine learning  citation - citation , and is widely used in artificial intelligence, especially in robotics  citation - citation ,  citation , due to its good performance of on-line adaptation and powerful learning ability to complex nonlinear systems
MISC	however there are still some difficult problems in practical applications
MISC	one problem is the exploration strategy, which contributes a lot to better balancing of  exploration  (trying previously unexplored strategies to find better policy) and  exploitation  (taking the most advantage of the experienced knowledge)
MISC	to combat those problems, many methods have been proposed in recent years
MISC	temporal abstraction and decomposition methods have been explored to solve such problems as rl and dynamic programming (dp) to speed up learning  citation - citation
MISC	different kinds of learning paradigms are combined to optimize rl
MISC	for example, smith  citation  presented a new model for representation and generalization in model-less rl based on the self-organizing map (som) and standard q-learning
MISC	many specific improvements are also implemented to modify related rl methods in practice  citation ,  citation ,  citation ,  citation ,  citation ,  citation
MISC	some results have shown that quantum computation can more efficiently solve some difficult problems than the classical counterpart
MISC	the shor algorithm can give an exponential speedup for factoring large integers into prime numbers and it has been realized  citation  for the factorization of integer 15 using nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr)
MISC	the grover algorithm can achieve a square speedup over classical algorithms in unsorted database searching and its experimental implementations have also been demonstrated using nmr  citation - citation  and quantum optics  citation ,  citation  for a system with four states
MISC	some methods have also been explored to connect quantum computation and machine learning
MISC	for example, the quantum computing version of artificial neural network has been studied from the pure theory to the simple simulated and experimental implementation  citation - citation
MISC	rigatos and tzafestas  citation  used quantum computation for the parallelization of a fuzzy logic control algorithm to speed up the fuzzy inference
MISC	quantum or quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms have been proposed to improve the existing evolutionary algorithms  citation
MISC	recently the quantum search technique has been used to dynamic programming  citation
MISC	taking advantage of quantum computation, some novel algorithms inspired by quantum characteristics will not only improve the performance of existing algorithms on traditional computers, but also promote the development of related research areas such as quantum computers and machine learning
OWNX	section ii contains the prerequisite and problem description of standard reinforcement learning, quantum computation and related quantum gates
OWNX	in section iii, quantum reinforcement learning is introduced systematically, where the state (action) space is represented with the quantum state, the exploration strategy based on the collapse postulate is achieved and a novel qrl algorithm is proposed specifically
OWNX	section v describes the simulated experiments and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of qrl algorithm
OWNX	in section vi, we briefly discuss some related problems of qrl for future work
OWNX	concluding remarks are given in section vii
OWNX	we develop the concept of  abc -boost ( a daptive  b ase  c lass boost) for  multi-class classification and  present   abc -mart, a concrete implementation of  abc -boost
MISC	the original mart ( m ultiple  a dditive  r egression  t rees) algorithm has been very successful in large-scale applications
MISC	a training data set  symbol  consists of  symbol  feature vectors (samples)  symbol , and  symbol  class labels,  symbol ,  symbol  to  symbol
MISC	the  task is to predict the class labels
MISC	many classification algorithms are based on  boosting  citation , which is  regarded one of most significant breakthroughs in machine learning
MISC	mart citation  ( m ultiple  a dditive  r egression  t rees) is a successful boosting algorithm, especially for large-scale applications in industry practice
MISC	citation  used an underlying learning algorithm based on mart
MISC	mcrank  citation , the classification-based ranking method, also used mart as the underlying learning procedure
OWNX	we present   abc -mart, a concrete implementation of {abc}-boost
MISC	abc-boost  is based on the following two key ideas:   for multi-class classification, popular loss functions for  symbol  classes usually assume a constraint citation   such that only the values for  symbol  classes are needed
OWNX	therefore, we can choose a  base class  and derive  algorithms only for   symbol  classes
OWNX	thus, we  adaptively  choose the base class which  has the ``worst'' performance
MISC	for multi-class ( symbol ) classification, the sum-to-zero constraint on the loss function is also ubiquitously adopted citation
OWNX	in particular, the multi-class  logitboost  citation  algorithm was derived by explicitly averaging over  symbol  base classes
MISC	all three algorithms assume the ``sum-to-zero'' constraint
OWNX	however, we obtain different first and second derivatives of the loss function, from mart citation  and  logitboost  citation
OWNX	see section  for details
OWNX	in terms of implementation, our proposed abc-mart differs from the original mart algorithm only in a few lines of code
OWNX	since mart is known to be a successful algorithm, much of our work is devoted to the empirical comparisons of abc-mart with mart
OWNX	our experiment results on publicly available data sets will demonstrate that abc-mart could considerably improves mart
MISC	also, abc-mart reduces both the training and testing time by  symbol , which may be quite beneficial when  symbol  is small
OWNX	in our study, the  covertype  data set from the uci repository is reasonably large with 581,012 observations \\   we first review the original mart algorithm and functional gradient boosting citation
MISC	lasso, or  symbol  regularized least squares, has been explored extensively for its remarkable sparsity properties
MISC	this allows a principled selection of the regularizer, and in particular, generalizations of lasso that also yield convex optimization problems are obtained by considering different uncertainty sets
MISC	secondly, robustness can itself be used as an avenue to exploring different properties of the solution
MISC	the problem is to find a vector  symbol  so that the  symbol  norm of the residual  symbol  is minimized, for a given matrix  symbol  and vector  symbol
MISC	from a learning/regression perspective, each row of  symbol  can be regarded as a training sample, and the corresponding element of  symbol  as the target value of this observed sample
MISC	each column of  symbol  corresponds to a feature, and the objective is to find a set of weights so that the weighted sum of the feature values approximates the target value
MISC	it is well known that minimizing the least squared error can lead to sensitive solutions  citation
MISC	many regularization methods have been proposed to decrease this sensitivity
MISC	among them, tikhonov regularization  citation  and lasso~ citation  are two widely known and cited algorithms
MISC	these methods minimize a weighted sum of the residual norm and a certain regularization term,  symbol  for tikhonov regularization and  symbol  for lasso
OWNX	the first result of this paper is that the solution to lasso has robustness properties: it is the solution to a robust optimization problem
MISC	in itself, this interpretation of lasso as the solution to a robust least squares problem is a development in line with the results of  citation
MISC	such a noise model is of interest when values of features are obtained with some noisy pre-processing steps, and the magnitudes of such noises are known or bounded
MISC	another situation of interest is where features are meaningfully coupled
OWNX	we define  coupled  and  uncoupled  disturbances and uncertainty sets precisely in section  below
MISC	intuitively, a disturbance is feature-wise coupled if the variation or disturbance across features satisfy joint constraints, and uncoupled otherwise
MISC	secondly, and perhaps most significantly, robustness  is a strong property that can itself be used as an avenue to investigating different properties of the solution
OWNX	we show that robustness of the solution can explain why the solution is sparse
OWNX	the analysis as well as the specific results we obtain differ from standard sparsity results, providing different geometric intuition, and extending beyond the least-squares setting
MISC	sparsity results obtained for lasso ultimately depend on the fact that introducing additional features incurs larger  symbol -penalty than the least squares error reduction
OWNX	in contrast, we exploit the fact that a robust solution is, by definition, the optimal solution under a worst-case perturbation
OWNX	our results show that, essentially, a coefficient of the solution is nonzero if the corresponding feature is relevant under all allowable perturbations
OWNX	in addition to sparsity, we also use robustness directly to prove consistency of lasso
OWNX	in section~, we formulate the robust regression problem with feature-wise independent disturbances, and show that this formulation is equivalent to a least-square problem with a weighted  symbol  norm regularization term
OWNX	hence, we provide an interpretation of lasso from a robustness perspective
OWNX	we generalize the robust regression formulation to loss functions of arbitrary norm in section~
MISC	this can be used to mitigate the conservativeness of the robust solution  and to obtain solutions with additional properties
OWNX	%we call these features ``coupled''
OWNX	in section~, we present new sparsity results for the robust regression problem with feature-wise independent disturbances
OWNX	next, we relate lasso to kernel density estimation in section~
OWNX	this allows us to re-prove consistency in a statistical learning setup, using the new robustness tools and formulation we introduce
OWNX	along with our results on sparsity, this illustrates the power of robustness in explaining and also exploring different properties of the solution
OWNX	finally, we prove in section~ a ``no-free-lunch'' theorem, stating that an algorithm that encourages sparsity cannot be stable {notation}
OWNX	we use capital letters to represent matrices, and boldface letters to represent column vectors
MISC	row vectors are represented as the transpose of column vectors
MISC	for a vector  symbol ,  symbol  denotes its  symbol  element
MISC	a vector with length  symbol  and each element equals  symbol  is denoted as  symbol
MISC	a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence is that nobody really knows what intelligence is
MISC	these are then mathematically formalised to produce a general measure of intelligence for arbitrary machines
OWNX	we believe that this measure formally captures the concept of machine intelligence in the broadest reasonable sense
MISC	a more principled approach would be to use one of the many standard intelligence tests that are available
MISC	one response to this problem might be to develop specific kinds of tests for specific kinds of entities; just as intelligence tests for children differ to intelligence tests for adults
MISC	the difficulty of doing this is readily apparent
MISC	consider, for example, the memory and numerical computation tasks that appear in some intelligence tests and which were once regarded as defining hallmarks of human intelligence
OWNX	we now know that these tasks are absolutely trivial for a machine and thus do not test the machine's intelligence
MISC	indeed even the mentally demanding task of playing chess has been largely reduced to brute force search
OWNX	as technology advances, our concept of what intelligence is continues to evolve with it
MISC	any proposed definition must encompass the essence of human intelligence, as well as other possibilities, in a consistent way
MISC	it should not be limited to any particular set of senses, environments or goals, nor should it be limited to any specific kind of hardware, such as silicon or biological neurons
MISC	it should be based on principles which are sufficiently fundamental so as to be unlikely to alter over time
OWNX	this framework is formally defined in  section
OWNX	in  section  we use our developed formalism to produce a formal definition of intelligence
OWNX	section  closes with a short summary
MISC	it can be shown that the intelligence measure presented here is in fact a variant of the intelligence order relation that appears in the theory of aixi, the provably optimal universal agent  citation
OWNX	naturally, we expect such a bold initiative to be met with resistance
OWNX	however, we hope that the reader will appreciate the value of our approach: with a formally precise definition put forward we aim to better our understanding of what is a notoriously subjective and slippery concept
MISC	hidden markov models (hmms) are one of the most fundamental and widely used statistical tools for modeling discrete time series
MISC	in general, learning hmms from data is computationally hard (under cryptographic assumptions), and practitioners typically resort to search heuristics which suffer from the usual local optima issues
OWNX	we prove that under a natural separation condition (bounds on the smallest singular value of the hmm parameters), there is an efficient and provably correct algorithm for learning hmms
MISC	the sample complexity of the algorithm does not explicitly depend on the number of distinct (discrete) observations---it implicitly depends on this quantity through spectral properties of the underlying hmm
MISC	this makes the algorithm particularly applicable to settings with a large number of observations, such as those in natural language processing where the space of observation is sometimes the words in a language
MISC	the algorithm is also simple, employing only a singular value decomposition and matrix multiplications
MISC	hidden markov models (hmms)  citation  are the workhorse statistical model for discrete time series, with widely diverse applications including automatic speech recognition, natural language processing (nlp), and genomic sequence modeling
MISC	in this model, a discrete hidden state evolves according to some markovian dynamics, and observations at a particular time depend only on the hidden state at that time
MISC	the learning problem is to estimate the model only with observation samples from the underlying distribution
MISC	thus far, the predominant learning algorithms have been local search heuristics, such as the baum-welch / em algorithm  citation
MISC	it is not surprising that practical algorithms have resorted to heuristics, as the general learning problem has been shown to be hard under cryptographic assumptions  citation
MISC	the situation is in many ways analogous to learning mixture distributions with samples from the underlying distribution
MISC	there, the general problem is also believed to be hard
MISC	however, much recent progress has been made when certain separation assumptions are made with respect to the component mixture distributions ( eg ~ citation )
MISC	roughly speaking, these separation assumptions imply that with high probability, given a point sampled from the distribution, one can determine the mixture component that generated the point
OWNX	we present a simple and efficient algorithm for learning hmms under a certain natural separation condition
OWNX	we provide two results for learning
OWNX	the first is that we can approximate the joint distribution over observation sequences of length  symbol  (here, the quality of approximation is measured by total variation distance)
MISC	as  symbol  increases, the approximation quality degrades polynomially
OWNX	our second result is on approximating the  conditional  distribution over a future observation, conditioned on some history of observations
OWNX	we show that this error is asymptotically bounded--- i e ~for any  symbol , conditioned on the observations prior to time  symbol , the error in predicting the  symbol -th outcome is controlled
OWNX	our algorithm can be thought of as `improperly' learning an hmm in that we do not explicitly recover the transition and observation models
OWNX	however, our model does maintain a hidden state representation which is closely (in fact, linearly) related to the hmm's, and can be used for interpreting the hidden state
OWNX	the separation condition we require is a spectral condition on both the observation matrix and the transition matrix
OWNX	roughly speaking, we require that the observation distributions arising from distinct hidden states be distinct (which we formalize by singular value conditions on the observation matrix)
MISC	this requirement can be thought of as being weaker than the separation condition for clustering in that the observation distributions can overlap quite a bit---given one observation, we do not necessarily have the information to determine which hidden state it was generated from (unlike in the clustering literature)
OWNX	we also have a spectral condition on the correlation between adjacent observations
OWNX	we believe both of these conditions to be quite reasonable in many practical applications
OWNX	the algorithm we present has both polynomial sample and computational complexity
MISC	computationally, the algorithm is quite simple---at its core is a singular value decomposition (svd) of a correlation matrix between past and future observations
MISC	this svd can be viewed as a canonical correlation analysis (cca)~ citation  between past and future observations
OWNX	the sample complexity results we present do not explicitly depend on the number of distinct observations; rather, they implicitly depend on this number through spectral properties of the hmm
MISC	this makes the algorithm particularly applicable to settings with a large number of observations, such as those in nlp where the space of observations is sometimes the words in a language
MISC	many databases store data in relational format, with different types of entities and information about links between the entities
MISC	the field of statistical-relational learning (srl) has developed a number of new statistical models for such data
MISC	class-level statistical relationships are important in themselves, and they support applications like policy making, strategic planning, and query optimization
MISC	most current srl methods find class-level dependencies, but their main task is to support instance-level predictions about the attributes or links of specific entities
OWNX	we focus only on class-level prediction, and describe algorithms for learning class-level models that are orders of magnitude faster for this task
OWNX	our algorithms learn bayes nets with relational structure, leveraging the efficiency of single-table nonrelational bayes net learners
MISC	after learning compiles the database statistics into a bayes net, querying these statistics via bayes net inference is faster than with sql queries, and does not depend on the size of the database
MISC	many real-world applications store data in relational format, with different tables for entities and their links
MISC	standard machine learning techniques are applied to data stored in a single table, that is, in nonrelational, propositional or ``flat" format  citation
MISC	the field of statistical-relational learning (srl) aims to extend machine learning algorithms to relational data  citation
MISC	one of the major machine learning tasks is to use data to build a  generative statistical model  for the variables in an application domain  citation
MISC	in the single-table learning setting, the goal is often to represent predictive dependencies between the attributes of a single individual (e g , between the intelligence and ranking of a student)
MISC	in the srl setting, the goal is often to represent, in addition, dependencies between attributes of different individuals that are related or linked to each other (e g , between the intelligence of a student and the difficulty of a course given that the student is registered in the course)
MISC	in the past few years powerful generalizations to the euclidean k-means problem have been made, such as bregman clustering~ citation , co-clustering (i e , simultaneous clustering of rows and columns of an input matrix)~ citation , and tensor clustering~ citation
MISC	researchers have developed approximation algorithms of varying degrees of sophistication for k-means, k-medians, and more recently also for bregman clustering~ citation
MISC	however, there seem to be no approximation algorithms for bregman co- and tensor clustering
OWNX	going beyond bregman divergences, we also prove an approximation factor for tensor clustering with arbitrary separable metrics
OWNX	through extensive experiments we evaluate the characteristics of our method, and show that it also has practical impact
MISC	the well-known euclidean k-means problem that partitions the input data points (vectors in  symbol ) into  symbol  clusters while minimizing sums of their squared distances to corresponding cluster centroids, is an np hard problem~ citation  (exponential in  symbol )
MISC	however, simple and frequently used procedures that rapidly obtain local minima exist since a long time~ citation
MISC	because of its wide applicability and importance, the euclidean k-means problem has been generalized in several directions
MISC	for these problems too, the commonly used heuristics perform well, but do not provide theoretical guarantees (or at best assure local optimality)
MISC	in stark contrast, approximation algorithms for tensor clustering are much less studied
MISC	in all factors  symbol  is an approximation guarantee for clustering either rows or columns
OWNX	in the terminology of~ citation , we focus on the ``block average'' versions of co- and tensor clustering
MISC	additional discussion and relevant references for co-clustering can be found in~ citation , while for the lesser known problem of tensor clustering more background can be gained by referring to~ citation
MISC	the enormous successes have been made by quantum algorithms during the last decade
AIMX	in this paper, we combine the quantum game with the problem of data clustering, and then develop a quantum-game-based clustering algorithm, in which data points in a dataset are considered as players who can make decisions and implement quantum strategies in quantum games
MISC	later, he uses an link-removing-and-rewiring (lrr) function to change his neighbors and adjust the strength of links connecting to them in order to maximize his payoff
MISC	consequently, the simulation results have demonstrated that data points in datasets are clustered reasonably and efficiently, and the clustering algorithms have fast rates of convergence
OWNX	quantum computation is an extremely exciting and rapidly growing field
MISC	more recently, an increasing number of researchers with different backgrounds, ranging from physics, computer sciences and information theory to mathematics and philosophy, are involved in researching properties of quantum-based computation~ citation
MISC	during the last decade, a series of significant breakthroughs had been made
MISC	one was that in 1994 peter shor surprised the world by proposing a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for integer factorization  citation , while in the classical world the best-known classical factoring algorithm works in superpolynomial time
MISC	three years later, in 1997, lov grover proved that a quantum computer could search an unsorted database in the square root of the time  citation
MISC	meanwhile, gilles brassard et al combined ideas from grover's and shor's quantum algorithms to propose a quantum counting algorithm  citation
MISC	in recent years, many interests focus on the quantum game theory and considerable work has been done
MISC	for instance, d a meyer~ citation  studied the penny flip game in the quantum world firstly
MISC	his result showed that if a player was allowed to implement quantum strategies, he would always defeat his opponent who played the classical strategies and increase his expected payoff as well j eisert et al ~ citation  quantized the prisoners' dilemma and demonstrated that the dilemma could be escaped when both players resort to quantum strategies a p
MISC	besides, some experiments about the quantum games have also been implemented on different quantum computers~ citation
MISC	for more details about quantum games, see~ citation
MISC	furthermore, it is more important that they offer a new way to find potentially dramatic algorithmic speed-ups
AIMX	therefore, we may ask naturally: can we construct quantum versions of classical algorithms or present new quantum algorithms to solve the problems in pattern recognition faster and better on a quantum computer
MISC	in addition, data clustering is a main branch of pattern recognition, which is widely used in many fields such as pattern analysis, data mining, information retrieval and image segmentation
MISC	in these fields, however, there is usually little priori knowledge available about the data
MISC	in response to these restrictions, clustering methodology come into being which is particularly suitable for the exploration of interrelationships among data points
MISC	data clustering is the formal study of algorithms and methods for grouping or classifying unlabeled data points~ citation
MISC	in other words, its task is to find the inherent structure of a given collection of unlabeled data points and group them into meaningful clusters~ citation
AIMX	in this paper, we attempt to combine the quantum game with the problem of data clustering in order to establish a novel clustering algorithm based on quantum games
OWNX	in our algorithms, unlabeled data points in a dataset are regarded as players who can make decisions in quantum games
MISC	on a time-varying network formed by players, each player is permitted to use quantum strategies and plays a  symbol  entangled quantum game against every one of his neighbors respectively
MISC	later, he applies a link-removing-and-rewiring (lrr) function to remove the links of neighbors with small payoffs and create new links to neighbors with higher payoffs at the same time
MISC	furthermore, the strength of links between a player and his neighbors is different from one another, which is updated by the grover iteration
MISC	during quantum games, the structure of network and the strength of links between players tend toward stability gradually
OWNX	in section 3, the algorithms are established in two cases of strategies, payoff matrices and link-removing-and-rewiring (lrr) functions, and then they are elaborated and analyzed
OWNX	in section 4, the relationship between the number of nearest neighbors and the number of clusters is discussed
OWNX	in section 5, those datasets used in the simulations are introduced briefly, and then results of algorithms are demonstrated
OWNX	the conclusion is given in section 6
OWNX	we consider a multi-round auction setting motivated by pay-per-click auctions for internet advertising
MISC	an advertiser derives value from clicks; the value of a click is her private information
OWNX	initially, neither the auctioneer nor the advertisers have any information about the likelihood of clicks on the advertisements
MISC	the auctioneer's goal is to design a (dominant strategies) truthful mechanism that (approximately) maximizes the social welfare
MISC	in particular, for both problems the quality of an algorithm can be characterized by  regret , the difference in social welfare between the algorithm and the benchmark which always selects the same ``best" advertisement
OWNX	moreover, we provide a truthful mechanism which (essentially) matches our lower bound on regret
MISC	in recent years there has been much interest in understanding the implication of strategic behavior on the performance of algorithms whose input is distributed among selfish agents
MISC	this study was mainly motivated by the internet, the main arena of large scale interaction of agents with conflicting goals
MISC	the field of algorithmic mechanism design~ citation  studies the design of mechanisms in computational settings (for background see the recent book~ citation  and survey~ citation )
MISC	much attention has been drawn to the market for sponsored search (e g ~ citation ), a multi-billion dollar market with numerous auctions running every second
MISC	research on sponsored search mostly focus on equilibria of the generalized second price (gsp) auction~ citation , the auction that is most commonly used in practice (e g by google and bing), or on the design of truthful auctions~ citation
MISC	all these auctions rely on knowing the rates at which users click on the different advertisements (a k a
MISC	click-through rates, or ctrs), and do not consider the process in which these ctrs are learned or refined over time by observing users' behavior
MISC	in this setting, there are  symbol  agents
MISC	each agent  symbol  has a single advertisement, and a  private  value  symbol  for every click she gets
MISC	the mechanism is an online algorithm that first solicits bids from the agents, and then runs for  symbol  rounds
MISC	the goal is to maximize the social welfare \omit{}% since the payments cancel out, this is equivalent to maximizing the total value derived from clicks, where an agent's contribution to that total is her private value times the number of clicks she receives
MISC	we call this setting the   \omit{} in the absence of strategic behavior this problem reduces to a standard mab formulation in which an algorithm repeatedly chooses one of the  symbol  alternatives (``arms") and observes the associated payoff: the value-per-click of the corresponding ad if the ad is clicked, and  symbol  otherwise
MISC	the crucial aspect in mab problems is the tradeoff between acquiring more information ( exploration ) and using the current information to choose a good agent ( exploitation )
MISC	mab problems have been studied intensively for the past three decades
MISC	in particular, the above formulation is well-understood~ citation  in terms of  regret  relative to the benchmark which always chooses the same ``best" alternative ( time-invariant benchmark )
MISC	this notion of regret naturally extends to the strategic setting outlined above, the total payoff being exactly equal to the social welfare, and the regret being exactly the loss in social welfare relative to the time-invariant benchmark
OWNX	broadly, we ask how the design of mab algorithms is affected by the restriction of truthfulness: what is the difference between the best  algorithms  and the best  truthful mechanisms
OWNX	we are not aware of any prior work that characterizes truthful online learning algorithms or proves negative results on their performance
OWNX	we present an algorithm, called the  symbol , for learning to make decisions in situations where the payoff of only one choice is observed, rather than all choices
OWNX	we show that the offset tree is an optimal reduction to binary classification
MISC	in particular, it has regret at most  symbol  times the regret of the binary classifier it uses (where  symbol  is the number of choices), and no reduction to binary classification can do better
MISC	this reduction is also computationally optimal, both at training and test time, requiring just  symbol  work to train on an example or make a prediction
MISC	experiments with the  symbol  show that it generally performs better than several alternative approaches
MISC	as an example, consider an internet site recommending ads or other content based on such observable quantities as user history and search engine queries, which are unique or nearly unique for every decision
MISC	after the ad is displayed, a user either clicks on it or not
MISC	in an online version of the problem, a policy chooses which ads to display and uses the observed feedback to improve its future ad choices
MISC	a good solution to this problem must explore different choices and properly exploit the feedback
MISC	the problem faced by an internet site, however, is more complex
MISC	they have observed many interactions historically, and would like to exploit them in forming an initial policy, which may then be improved by further online exploration
MISC	since exploration decisions have already been made, online solutions are not applicable
OWNX	indeed, some of our experiments are done in an online setting
MISC	many ai researchers and cognitive scientists have argued that analogy is the core of cognition
MISC	the most influential work on computational modeling of analogy-making is structure mapping theory (smt) and its implementation in the structure mapping engine (sme)
MISC	a limitation of sme is the requirement for complex hand-coded representations
OWNX	we introduce the latent relation mapping engine (lrme), which combines ideas from sme and latent relational analysis (lra) in order to remove the requirement for hand-coded representations
MISC	lrme builds analogical mappings between lists of words, using a large corpus of raw text to automatically discover the semantic relations among the words
OWNX	we evaluate lrme on a set of twenty analogical mapping problems, ten based on scientific analogies and ten based on common metaphors
MISC	lrme achieves human-level performance on the twenty problems
OWNX	when we are faced with a problem, we try to recall similar problems that we have faced in the past, so that we can transfer our knowledge from past experience to the current problem
OWNX	we make an analogy between the past situation and the current situation, and we use the analogy to transfer knowledge \shortcite{gentner83,minsky86,holyoak95,hofstadter01,hawkins04}
MISC	in his survey of the computational modeling of analogy-making, french  citation  cites structure mapping theory (smt) \shortcite{gentner83} and its implementation in the structure mapping engine (sme)  citation  as the most influential work on modeling of analogy-making
MISC	in sme, an analogical mapping  symbol  is from a source  symbol  to a target  symbol
MISC	gentner  citation  argues that there are two kinds of similarity, attributional similarity and relational similarity
MISC	the distinction between attributes and relations may be understood in terms of predicate logic
MISC	an attribute is a predicate with one argument, such as {large}( symbol ), meaning  symbol  is large
MISC	the structure mapping engine prefers mappings based on relational similarity over mappings based on attributional similarity \shortcite{falkenhainer89}
MISC	for example, sme is able to build a mapping from a representation of the solar system (the source) to a representation of the rutherford-bohr model of the atom (the target)
MISC	the sun is mapped to the nucleus, planets are mapped to electrons, and mass is mapped to charge
MISC	the sun and the nucleus are very different in terms of their attributes: the sun is very large and the nucleus is very small
MISC	likewise, planets and electrons have little attributional similarity
MISC	on the other hand, planets revolve around the sun like electrons revolve around the nucleus
MISC	the mass of the sun attracts the mass of the planets like the charge of the nucleus attracts the charge of the electrons
MISC	gentner  citation  provides evidence that children rely primarily on attributional similarity for mapping, gradually switching over to relational similarity as they mature
MISC	she uses the terms  mere appearance  to refer to mapping based mostly on attributional similarity,  analogy  to refer to mapping based mostly on relational similarity, and  literal similarity  to refer to a mixture of attributional and relational similarity
OWNX	since we use analogical mappings to solve problems and make predictions, we should focus on structure, especially causal relations, and look beyond the surface attributes of things \shortcite{gentner83}
MISC	the analogy between the solar system and the rutherford-bohr model of the atom illustrates the importance of going beyond mere appearance, to the underlying structures
MISC	chalmers, french, and hofstadter  citation  criticize sme's requirement for complex hand-coded representations
MISC	they argue that most of the hard work is done by the human who creates these high-level hand-coded representations, rather than by sme }  }  gentner, forbus, and their colleagues have attempted to avoid hand-coding in their recent work with sme
MISC	the cogsketch system can generate lisp representations from simple sketches  citation
MISC	the gizmo system can generate lisp representations from qualitative physics models  citation
MISC	the learning reader system can generate lisp representations from natural language text \shortcite{forbus07}
MISC	these systems do not require lisp input
MISC	forbus et al citation  note that opencyc contains more than 58,000 hand-coded concepts, and they have added further hand-coded concepts to opencyc, in order to support cogsketch
MISC	the gizmo system requires the user to hand-code a physical model, using the methods of qualitative physics \shortcite{yan05}
OWNX	we call the resulting algorithm the latent relation mapping engine (lrme)
OWNX	we represent the semantic relation between two terms using a vector, in which the elements are derived from pattern frequencies in a large corpus of raw text
MISC	because the semantic relations are automatically derived from a corpus, lrme does not require hand-coded representations of relations
MISC	given these two lists, lrme uses the corpus to build representations of the relations among the terms, and then it constructs a mapping between the two lists
MISC	since roles are relations, not attributes, it is appropriate to treat semantic role labeling as an analogical mapping problem
MISC	for example, the {judgement} semantic frame contains semantic roles such as {judge}, {evaluee}, and {reason}, and the {statement} frame contains roles such as {speaker}, {addressee}, {message}, {topic}, and {medium} \shortcite{gildea02}
MISC	the task of identifying semantic roles is to automatically label sentences with their roles, as in the following examples \shortcite{gildea02}:     if we have a training set of labeled sentences and a testing set of unlabeled sentences, then we may view the task of labeling the testing sentences as a problem of creating analogical mappings between the training sentences (sources) and the testing sentences (targets)
MISC	'' might be mapped to ``they blame the company for polluting the environment
OWNX	'' once a mapping has been found, we can transfer knowledge, in the form of semantic role labels, from the source to the target }  in section~, we briefly discuss the hypotheses behind the design of lrme
OWNX	we then precisely define the task that is performed by lrme, a specific form of analogical mapping, in section~
OWNX	lrme builds on latent relational analysis (lra), hence we summarize lra in section~
OWNX	we discuss potential applications of lrme in section~
OWNX	to evaluate lrme, we created twenty analogical mapping problems, ten science analogy problems \shortcite{holyoak95} and ten common metaphor problems \shortcite{lakoff80}
MISC	table~ is one of the science analogy problems
OWNX	our intended solution is given in table~
OWNX	to validate our intended solutions, we gave our colleagues the lists of terms (as in table~) and asked them to generate mappings between the lists
OWNX	section~ presents the results of this experiment
OWNX	across the twenty problems, the average agreement with our intended solutions (as in table~) was 87 6\%
OWNX	the lrme algorithm is outlined in section~, along with its evaluation on the twenty mapping problems
MISC	the difference between this performance and the human average of 87 6\% is not statistically significant
OWNX	section~ examines a variety of alternative approaches to the analogy mapping task
MISC	this performance is significantly below lrme and human performance
OWNX	in section~, we discuss some questions that are raised by the results in the preceding sections
OWNX	related work is described in section~, future work and limitations are considered in section~, and we conclude in section~
MISC	general purpose intelligent learning agents cycle through (complex,non-mdp) sequences of observations, actions, and rewards
MISC	so far it is an art performed by human designers to extract the right state representation out of the bare observations, ie \ to reduce the agent setup to the mdp framework
OWNX	before we can think of mechanizing this search for suitable mdps, we need a formal objective criterion
MISC	extensions to more realistic dynamic bayesian networks are developed in the companion article  citation  {keywords:} evolutionary algorithms, ranking selection, tournament selection, equivalence, efficiency
MISC	artificial general intelligence (agi) is concerned with designing agents that perform well in a wide range of environments  citation
MISC	among the well-established ``narrow'' ai approaches, arguably reinforcement learning (rl) pursues most directly the same goal
MISC	the agent's objective is to collect as much reward as possible
MISC	the simplest interesting environmental class consists of finite state fully observable markov decision processes (mdps)  citation , which is reasonably well understood
MISC	extensions to continuous states with (non)linear function approximation  citation , partial observability (pomdp)  citation , structured mdps (dbns)  citation , and others have been considered, but the algorithms are much more brittle
MISC	even if  potentially  useful representations have been found, it is usually not clear which one will turn out to be better, except in situations where we already know a perfect model
MISC	think of a mobile robot equipped with a camera plunged into an unknown environment
OWNX	while we can imagine which image features are potentially useful, we cannot know which ones will actually be useful
OWNX	before we can think of mechanically searching for the ``best'' mdp representation, we need a formal objective criterion
MISC	reality is a non-ergodic partially observable uncertain unknown environment in which acquiring experience can be expensive
MISC	so we want/need to exploit the data (past experience) at hand optimally, cannot generate virtual samples since the model is not given (need to be learned itself), and there is no reset-option
MISC	in regression and classification, penalized maximum likelihood criteria  citation  have successfully been used for semi-parametric model selection
MISC	it is far from obvious how to apply them in rl
OWNX	ultimately we do not care about the observations but the rewards
MISC	the rewards depend on the states, but the states are arbitrary in the sense that they are model-dependent functions of the data
OWNX	indeed, our derived cost function cannot be interpreted as a usual model+data code length
MISC	as partly detailed later, the suggested  symbol mdp model could be regarded % as a scaled-down practical instantiation of aixi  citation , % as a way to side-step the open problem of learning pomdps, % as extending the idea of state-aggregation from planning (based on bi-simulation metrics  citation ) to rl (based on code length), % as generalizing u-tree  citation  to arbitrary features, % or as an alternative to psrs  citation  for which proper learning algorithms have yet to be developed
MISC	%   throughout this article,  symbol  denotes the binary logarithm, %  symbol  the empty string, % and  symbol  if  symbol  and  symbol  else is the kronecker symbol
MISC	% i generally omit separating commas if no confusion arises, in particular in indices
MISC	%  symbol  denotes an estimate of  symbol
MISC	symbol  denotes a probability over states and rewards or parts thereof
MISC	i do not distinguish between random variables  symbol  and realizations  symbol , and abbreviation  symbol  never leads to confusion
MISC	more specifically,  symbol  denotes the number of states, %  symbol  any state index, %  symbol  the current time, % and  symbol  any time
MISC	% further, in order not to get distracted at several places i gloss over initial conditions or special cases where inessential
MISC	feature markov decision processes ( symbol mdps)  citation  are well-suited for learning agents in general environments
MISC	nevertheless, unstructured ( symbol )mdps are limited to relatively simple environments
MISC	structured mdps like dynamic bayesian networks (dbns) are used for large-scale real-world problems
MISC	the primary contribution is to derive a cost criterion that allows to automatically extract the most relevant features from the environment, leading to the ``best'' dbn representation
MISC	keywords:  reinforcement learning; dynamic bayesian network; structure learning; feature learning; global vs local reward; explore-exploit
MISC	the agent-environment setup in which an  agent  interacts with an  environment  is a very general and prevalent framework for studying intelligent learning systems  citation
MISC	the reward may be very scarce, eg \ just +1 (-1) for winning (losing) a chess game, and 0 at all other times  citation
MISC	then the next cycle  symbol  starts
MISC	for example,  sequence prediction  is concerned with environments that do not react to the agents actions (e g \ a weather-forecasting ``action'')  citation ,  planning  deals with the case where the environmental function is known  citation ,  classification  and  regression  is for conditionally independent observations  citation ,  markov decision processes  (mdps) assume that  symbol  and  symbol  only depend on  symbol  and  symbol   citation , pomdps deal with  partially observable mdps   citation , and  dynamic bayesian networks  (dbns) with structured mdps  citation
MISC	concrete real-world problems can often be  modeled  as mdps
MISC	artificial general intelligence (agi)  citation  is concerned with designing  agents that perform well in a very large range of environments   citation , including all of the mentioned ones above and more
MISC	in this general situation, it is not a priori clear what the useful features are
MISC	indeed, any observation in the (far) past may be relevant in the future
MISC	a solution suggested in  citation  is to learn  symbol  itself
MISC	if  symbol  keeps too much of the history (e g \  symbol ), the resulting mdp is too large (infinite) and cannot be learned
MISC	if  symbol  keeps too little, the resulting state sequence is not markov
MISC	the  cost  criterion i develop formalizes this tradeoff and is minimized for the ``best''  symbol
MISC	at any time  symbol , the best  symbol  is the one that minimizes the markov code length of  symbol  and  symbol
MISC	this reminds but is actually quite different from mdl, which minimizes model+data code length  citation
MISC	real-world problems are structured and can often be represented by dynamic bayesian networks (dbns) with a reasonable number of nodes  citation
MISC	bayesian networks in general and dbns in particular are powerful tools for modeling and solving complex real-world problems
MISC	advances in theory and increase in computation power constantly broaden their range of applicability  citation
MISC	the primary contribution of this work is to extend the   symbol  selection principle  developed in  citation  for mdps to the conceptually much more demanding dbn case
MISC	the major extra complications are approximating, learning and coding the rewards, the dependence of the cost criterion on the dbn structure, learning the dbn structure, and how to store and find the optimal value function and policy
MISC	although this article is self-contained, it is recommended to read  citation  first
MISC	consider an agent interacting with an environment in cycles
MISC	in every interaction cycle the agent is rewarded for its performance
OWNX	we compare the average reward  symbol  from cycle  symbol  to  symbol  (average value) with the future discounted reward  symbol  from cycle  symbol  to  symbol  (discounted value)
OWNX	we show that asymptotically  symbol  for  symbol  and  symbol  for  symbol  are equal, provided both limits exist
MISC	further, if the effective horizon grows linearly with  symbol  or faster, then the existence of the limit of  symbol  implies that the limit of  symbol  exists
MISC	conversely, if the effective horizon grows linearly with  symbol  or slower, then existence of the limit of  symbol  implies that the limit of  symbol  exists
MISC	then the next cycle  symbol  starts
MISC	the simplest reasonable measure of performance is the total reward sum or equivalently the average reward, called average value  symbol , where  symbol  should be the lifespan of the agent
MISC	one problem is that the lifetime is often not known in advance, eg \ often the time one is willing to let a system run depends on its displayed performance
MISC	more serious is that the measure is indifferent to whether an agent receives high rewards early or late if the values are the same
MISC	a natural (non-arbitrary) choice for  symbol  is to consider the limit  symbol
MISC	while the indifference may be acceptable for finite  symbol , it can be catastrophic for  symbol
MISC	consider an agent that receives no reward until its first action is  symbol , and then once receives reward  symbol
MISC	hence  symbol  for  symbol , so the reward maximizing agent for  symbol  actually always acts with  symbol , and hence has zero reward, although a value arbitrarily close to 1 would be achievable (immortal agents are lazy  citation )
MISC	more serious, in general the limit  symbol  may not even exist
MISC	another approach is to consider a moving horizon
MISC	in cycle  symbol , the agent tries to maximize  symbol , where  symbol  increases with  symbol , eg \  symbol  with  symbol  being the horizon
MISC	this naive truncation is often used in games like chess (plus a heuristic reward in cycle  symbol ) to get a reasonably small search tree
MISC	while this can work in practice, it can lead to inconsistent optimal strategies, i e \ to agents that change their mind
MISC	consider the example above with  symbol
MISC	in every cycle  symbol  it is better first to act  symbol  and then  symbol  ( symbol ), rather than immediately  symbol  ( symbol ), or  symbol  ( symbol )
MISC	but entering the next cycle  symbol , the agent throws its original plan overboard, to now choose  symbol  in favor of  symbol , followed by  symbol
MISC	the standard solution to the above problems is to consider geometrically=exponentially discounted reward  citation
MISC	one discounts the reward for every cycle of delay by a factor  symbol , i e \ considers  symbol
MISC	the  symbol  maximizing policy is consistent in the sense that its actions  symbol  coincide with the optimal policy based on  symbol
MISC	at first glance, there seems to be no arbitrary lifetime  symbol  or horizon  symbol , but this is an illusion
MISC	symbol  is dominated by contributions from rewards  symbol , so has an effective horizon  symbol
MISC	while such a sliding effective horizon does not cause inconsistent policies, it can nevertheless lead to suboptimal behavior
MISC	for every (effective) horizon, there is a task that needs a larger horizon to be solved
MISC	there are elegant closed form solutions for bandit problems, which show that for any  symbol , the bayes-optimal policy can get stuck with a suboptimal arm (is not self-optimizing)  citation
MISC	there are various deep papers considering the limit  symbol   citation , and comparing it to the limit  symbol   citation
MISC	the analysis is typically restricted to ergodic mdps for which the limits  symbol  and  symbol  exist
OWNX	we also cannot consistently adapt  symbol  with  symbol
MISC	there is little work on other than geometric discounts
MISC	in the psychology and economics literature it has been argued that people discount a one day=cycle delay in reward more if it concerns rewards now rather than later, eg \ in a year (plus one day)  citation
MISC	so there is some work on ``sliding'' discount sequences  symbol
MISC	one can show that this also leads to inconsistent policies if  symbol  is non-geometric  citation
MISC	is there any non-geometric discount leading to consistent policies
MISC	in  citation  the generally discounted value  symbol  with  symbol  has been introduced
MISC	see  citation  for these and  citation  for more results
MISC	this discount has bounded effective horizon, so also does not lead to self-optimizing policies
MISC	the  asymptotic  total average performance  symbol  and future discounted performance  symbol  are of key interest
MISC	the importance of the performance measures  symbol  and  symbol , and general discount  symbol  has been discussed above
OWNX	our main result is that if both limits  symbol  and  symbol  exist, then they are necessarily equal (section , theorem )
MISC	somewhat surprisingly this holds for  any  discount sequence  symbol  and  any  environment (reward sequence  symbol ), whatsoever
MISC	note that limit  symbol  may exist or not, independent of whether  symbol  exists or not
OWNX	we present examples of the four possibilities in section
OWNX	conversely, if the effective horizon grows linearly with  symbol  or slower, then existence of  symbol  implies existence of  symbol  and their equality (section , theorem )
OWNX	in sections  and  we define and provide some basic properties of average and discounted value, respectively
OWNX	this paper introduces a model based upon games on an evolving network, and develops three clustering algorithms according to it
MISC	in the clustering algorithms, data points for clustering are regarded as players who can make decisions in games
MISC	on the network describing relationships among data points, an edge-removing-and-rewiring (err) function is employed to explore in a neighborhood of a data point, which removes edges connecting to neighbors with small payoffs, and creates new edges to neighbors with larger payoffs
MISC	as such, the connections among data points vary over time
MISC	during the evolution of network, some strategies are spread in the network
MISC	moreover, the experimental results have demonstrated that data points in datasets are clustered reasonably and efficiently, and the comparison with other algorithms also provides an indication of the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms \\ \\  keywords : unsupervised learning, data clustering, evolutionary game theory, evolutionarily stable strategy
MISC	cluster analysis is an important branch of pattern recognition, which is widely used in many fields such as pattern analysis, data mining, information retrieval and image segmentation
MISC	for the past thirty years, many excellent clustering algorithms have been presented, say,  k -means  citation , c4 5~ citation , support vector clustering (svc)  citation , spectral clustering~ citation , etc , in which the data points for clustering are fixed, and various functions are designed to find separating hyperplanes
MISC	in recent years, however, a significant change has been made
MISC	some researchers thought about that why not those data points could move by themselves, just like agents or something, and collect together automatically
MISC	game theory came into being with the book named "theory of games and economic behavior" by john von neumann and oskar morgenstern  citation  in 1940
MISC	in this period, cooperative game was widely studied
MISC	till 1950's, john nash published two well-known papers to present the theory of non-cooperative game, in which he proposed the concept of nash equilibrium, and proved the existence of equilibrium in a finite non-cooperative game  citation
MISC	although non-cooperative game was established on the rigorous mathematics, it required that players in a game must be perfect rational or even hyper-rational
MISC	if this assumption could not hold, the nash equilibrium might not be reached sometimes
MISC	on the other hand, evolutionary game theory  citation  stems from the researches in biology which are to analyze the conflict and cooperation between animals or plants
MISC	it differs from classical game theory by focusing on the dynamics of strategy change more than the properties of strategy equilibria, and does not require perfect rational players
MISC	besides, an important concept, evolutionarily stable strategy  citation , in evolutionary game theory was defined and introduced by john maynard smith and george r
MISC	so, if data points in a dataset are considered as players in games, could clusters be formed automatically by playing games among them
OWNX	this is the question that we attempt to answer
OWNX	in our clustering algorithm, each player hopes to maximize his own payoff, so he constantly adjusts his strategies by observing neighbors' payoffs
MISC	in the course of strategies evolving, some strategies are spread in the network of players
OWNX	in section 3, the model based upon games on evolving network is proposed and described specifically
OWNX	section 4 gives three algorithms based on this model, and the algorithms are elaborated and analyzed in detail
OWNX	section 5 introduces those datasets used in the experiments briefly, and then demonstrates experimental results of the algorithms
OWNX	the conclusion is given in section 6
MISC	cooperative decision making is a vision of future network management and control
MISC	distributed connection preemption is an important example where nodes can make intelligent decisions on allocating resources and controlling traffic flows for multi-class service networks
MISC	a challenge is that nodal decisions are spatially dependent as traffic flows trespass multiple nodes in a network
MISC	connection preemption is known to be np-complete
MISC	decentralized preemption is computationally efficient but may result in a poor performance
MISC	this work investigates distributed preemption where nodes decide whether and which flows to preempt using only local information exchange with neighbors
OWNX	in this work, we first model a large number of distributed preemption-decisions using a probabilistic graphical model
OWNX	we show that a sufficient condition for distributed preemption to be optimal is that local decisions should constitute a markov random field
MISC	the decision variables, however, do not possess an exact spatial markov dependence in reality due to the flows passing through multiple links
OWNX	hence we study traffic patterns of flows, and derive sufficient conditions on flows for the distributed preemption to be near-optimal
OWNX	we develop, based on the probabilistic graphical models, a near-optimal distributed algorithm
OWNX	we study trade-offs between near-optimal performance and complexity that corresponds to the amount of information-exchange of the distributed algorithm
MISC	the algorithm is validated by both analysis and simulation
MISC	a vision of future network management is to involve nodes to make intelligent decisions on allocating resources and controlling traffic flows
MISC	this includes admitting new flows by preempting less important existing flows, which is well studied in the policy based admission control (i e ,  admission is based on the priority of flows)  citation   citation
MISC	specifically, preemption is defined  at a prioritized multi-class network, where a new call needs  to be set up with a high priority between a source (s) and a destination  (d)  citation   citation   citation   citation   citation
MISC	preemption decisions is to decide which lower priority flows to remove to free the reserved bandwidth for the new call at a chosen route  citation   citation
CONT	the goal is to decide whether to preempt an active flow so that the total preempted bandwidth can be minimal under such constraints as bandwidth demand of a new call and available free bandwidth at each link  \\   the benefit of preemption has been described in the prior works
MISC	for example, preemption allows a new high-priority connection to access heavily crowded core networks, eg , multi-protocol label switched (mpls) networks  citation
MISC	connection preemption also improves resource utilization by allowing low-priority flows to access unused bandwidths  citation   citation
MISC	preemption sees potential applications in emerging networks
MISC	for example, in 802 11e wireless lan, delay sensitive ip packets in expedited forwarding (ef) class can be served earlier than the best-effort packets through preemption  citation
MISC	multi-level preemption and precedence (mlpp) is proposed to classify calls by their importance, which can be used for military as well as commercial networks  citation  \\  there are two significant challenges for preemption which are performance and complexity
MISC	complexity corresponds to the amount of information needed for preemption decision
MISC	preemption is known to be np-complete  citation
MISC	the complexity results from a large number of active flows supported by a core network for which preemption decisions need to be made
MISC	for example, for a 1gbps link, if the bandwidth of each flow is in the order of kbps, there would be thousands of flows supported per link
MISC	in addition, a flow generally passes through multiple nodes, making preemption decisions among nodes dependent and thus difficult to be done with local information
MISC	thus preemption is network-centric, and may require a huge amount of information to perform in a large network \\  for centralized preemption decisions, a centralized node maintains the routed-path information of active flows, their priorities and bandwidth occupancies at the entire route
MISC	the centralized node then decides which active flows to preempt upon the request of a new call
MISC	but the amount of management information needed can be overwhelming at the centralized node
MISC	for example, let  symbol  be the total number of distinct flows per priority class at the route of a new call
MISC	each flow has two states, preempted or not preempted
MISC	the total number of possible states is  symbol  for making a centralized decision
MISC	decentralized preemption is then adopted for reducing the amount of management information  citation  \\ decentralized preemption is done at each node individually, and thus requires a node to maintain its local information, i e , active flows at the adjacent links, their priorities and bandwidth occupancy
OWNX	such information is available locally at nodes
MISC	a node then decides, independently from the other nodes, which connections to preempt
MISC	this, however, may cause conflicting local decisions on the same flows that pass multiple links on the route, resulting in more preempted bandwidth than necessary
MISC	in other words, decentralized preemption decision neglects the spatial dependence for the flows across multiple links, and may perform poorly
MISC	but the amount of management information are greatly reduced compared with centralized preemption
MISC	for example, let  symbol  be the maximum number of active flows per link
MISC	since  symbol   symbol   symbol , compared with centralized preemption, decentralized schemes have a much smaller search space for preemption decisions
MISC	therefore, most algorithms in the literature focus on decentralized preemption (see  citation   citation  and references there in) \\ this work studies distributed decisions, that take into account spatial dependence among neighboring links through local information exchange
MISC	in fact, distributed preemption can be considered as a generalization of centralized and decentralized preemption
MISC	centralized preemption corresponds to one extreme case of distributed preemption that an entire route is  the neighborhood for information exchange; whereas, decentralized decisions correspond to another extreme case where the neighborhood size is zero
MISC	therefore, the communication complexity can be characterized in terms of neighborhood size
MISC	there is a trade-off between the optimality and the complexity \\  in general, it has been shown to be a difficult problem to develop a distributed algorithm whose performance is predictable and within a tolerable degradation (i e , given error bound) from that of the optimal scheme  citation
MISC	hence, the open issues are: (a)  when  can distributed decisions collectively result in a near-optimal global preemption (b)  how  to model a large number of dependent decision variables and to obtain near-optimal local decisions using distributed algorithms
OWNX	we apply machine learning to study these issues \\  {machine learning perspective:} a machine learning view of distributed preemption is that individual nodes ``learn to make decisions" collectively and iteratively
MISC	ideally, if each node has complete information on all active flows at the route of a new flow, the node will be able to make correct decisions on which flows to preempt
MISC	however, at any given time, a node has only partial information on the active flows on the route and its neighbors' decisions on the flows to preempt
MISC	but a node can adapt, i e , learn to make decisions based on those of its neighbors'
MISC	as neighbors learn from neighbors' neighbors, a node would indirectly learn what farther nodes decide only with a delay
MISC	eventually, all nodes would make local decisions, collectively resulting in a near-optimal preemption at the entire route \\  how would machine learning benefit distributed preemption
MISC	the problem of collective learning and decision-making has been a keen interest in machine learning and adaptive control  citation   citation , but has just begun to see applications in networking
MISC	in particular,  citation  proposes using markov random fields as a general model of decision-making in ad hoc wireless networks
MISC	the model is then applied to routing in wireless networks
MISC	spatial dependence among these variables poses a key challenge to preemption, is an origin of high communication complexity,  and has not been dealt with sufficiently in prior works
MISC	the randomness results from randomly arriving/departing active flows and their locations
MISC	the preemption decisions made on flows at each node are also random due to incomplete and inaccurate local information for distributed  preemption
OWNX	a hamiltonian combines local preemption decisions and constraints into a single quantity
MISC	the constraints include link capacity, unused bandwidths and bandwidth-demand of a new flow at each link
MISC	in general, distributed decisions may not be spatially markov, since the spatial dependence is caused by flows across multiple links
OWNX	hence we identify traffic patterns of active flows that result in approximately spatial markov dependence
OWNX	we then define the near-optimality of distributed decisions as the difference between the centralized and distributed decisions, measured in the hamiltonian, and obtain sufficient conditions for the difference to reside within an error bound \\ (c)  distributed decision algorithm:  a near-optimal distributed algorithm is derived based on the markov random field
MISC	the algorithms can be implemented through either message passing  citation  or gibbs sampling  citation  \\ (d)  trade-offs:  a challenging issue is the performance-complexity trade-off, i e , ``when" and ``how" distributed preemption can achieve  a near-optimal performance with a moderate complexity
MISC	here the  performance  measures the optimality of distributed preemption decision relative to that of the centralized optimal decision
MISC	the communication complexity of distributed preemption can be characterized by the amount of information used in distributed decision making
MISC	distributed decisions reduce complexity using information exchange only with neighbors, but may deviate from the optimal performance

OWNX	section  provides a further literature review and discussions
MISC	the emergence of low-cost sensor architectures for diverse modalities has made it possible to deploy sensor arrays that capture a single event from a large number of vantage points and using multiple modalities
MISC	manifold models provide a particularly powerful model that captures the structure of high-dimensional data when it is governed by a low-dimensional set of parameters
MISC	however, these models do not typically take into account dependencies among multiple sensors
OWNX	we thus propose a new  joint manifold  framework for data ensembles that exploits such dependencies
OWNX	we show that simple algorithms can exploit the joint manifold structure to improve their performance on standard signal processing applications
MISC	the geometric notion of a low-dimensional manifold is a common, yet powerful, tool for modeling high-dimensional data
MISC	manifold models arise in cases where ( i ) a  symbol -dimensional parameter  symbol  can be identified that carries the relevant information about a signal and ( ii ) the signal  symbol  changes as a continuous (typically nonlinear) function of these parameters
MISC	in these and many other cases, the geometry of the signal class forms a nonlinear  symbol -dimensional manifold in  symbol ,  symbol } where  symbol  is the  symbol -dimensional parameter space~ citation
MISC	low-dimensional manifolds have also been proposed as approximate models for nonparametric signal classes such as images of human faces or handwritten digits~ citation
OWNX	in such cases, we will show that it is advantageous to model this joint structure contained in the ensemble of manifolds as opposed to simply treating each manifold independently
OWNX	thus we introduce the concept of the  joint manifold : a model for the concatenation of the data vectors observed by the group of sensors
MISC	joint manifolds enable the development of improved manifold-based learning and estimation algorithms that exploit this structure
MISC	furthermore, they can be applied to data of any modality and dimensionality
OWNX	in this work we conduct a careful examination of the theoretical properties of joint manifolds
OWNX	we then observe that these properties lead to improved performance and noise-tolerance for a variety of signal processing algorithms when they exploit the joint manifold structure, as opposed to processing data from each manifold separately
MISC	related prior work has studied  manifold alignment , where the goal is to discover maps between several datasets that are governed by the same underlying low-dimensional structure
MISC	lafon et al \ proposed an algorithm to obtain a one-to-one matching between data points from several manifold-modeled classes~ citation
MISC	then, an affine function that matches a set of landmark points is computed and applied to the remainder of the datasets
MISC	this concept was extended by wang and mahadevan, who apply procrustes analysis on the dimensionality-reduced datasets to obtain an alignment function between a pair of manifolds~ citation
OWNX	in our setting, we assume that either ( i ) the manifold alignment is provided intrinsically via synchronization between the different sensors or ( ii ) the manifolds have been aligned using one of the approaches described above

MISC	davenport, chinmay hegde, marco f
MISC	duarte, \\ and richard g
OWNX	we consider the problem of joint universal variable-rate lossy coding and identification for parametric classes of stationary  symbol -mixing sources with general (polish) alphabets
MISC	the results are supplemented by several examples of parametric sources satisfying the regularity conditions \\ \\  index terms--- learning, minimum-distance density estimation, two-stage codes, universal vector quantization, vapnik--chervonenkis dimension
MISC	it is well known that lossless source coding and statistical modeling are complementary objectives
MISC	this fact is captured by the kraft inequality (see section~5 2 in cover and thomas  citation ), which provides a correspondence between uniquely decodable codes and probability distributions on a discrete alphabet
OWNX	if one has full knowledge of the source statistics, then one can design an optimal lossless code for the source, and  vice versa
MISC	however, in practice it is unreasonable to expect that the source statistics are known precisely, so one has to design  universal  schemes that perform asymptotically optimally within a given class of sources
MISC	in universal coding, too, as rissanen has shown in  citation , the coding and modeling objectives can be accomplished jointly: given a sufficiently regular parametric family of discrete-alphabet sources, the encoder can acquire the source statistics via maximum-likelihood estimation on a sufficiently long data sequence and use this knowledge to select an appropriate coding scheme
OWNX	even in nonparametric settings (e g , the class of all stationary ergodic discrete-alphabet sources), universal schemes such as ziv--lempel  citation  amount to constructing a probabilistic model for the source
OWNX	once we consider  lossy  coding, though, the relationship between coding and modeling is no longer so simple
OWNX	on the one hand, having full knowledge of the source statistics is certainly helpful for designing optimal rate-distortion codebooks
MISC	on the other hand, apart from some special cases (e g , for  iid 
MISC	bernoulli sources and the hamming distortion measure or for  iid 
MISC	this is not a problem when the emphasis is on compression, but there are situations in which one would like to compress the source and identify its statistics at the same time
MISC	suppose that the controller is geographically separated from the plant and connected to it via a noiseless digital channel whose capacity is  symbol  bits per use
MISC	then, given the time horizon  symbol , the objective is to design an encoder and a decoder for the controller to obtain reliable estimates of both the plant parameters and the plant state sequence from the  symbol  possible outputs of the decoder
MISC	to state the problem in general terms, consider an information source emitting a sequence  symbol  of random variables taking values in an alphabet  symbol
MISC	suppose that the process distribution of  symbol  is not specified completely, but it is known to be a member of some parametric class  symbol
MISC	we wish to answer the following two questions:   is the class  symbol  universally encodable with respect to a given single-letter distortion measure  symbol , by codes with a given structure (e g , all fixed-rate block codes with a given per-letter rate, all variable-rate block codes, etc )
MISC	in other words, does there exist a scheme that is asymptotically optimal for each  symbol ,  symbol
MISC	if the answer to question 1) is positive, can the codes be constructed in such a way that the decoder can not only reconstruct the source, but also identify its process distribution  symbol , in an asymptotically optimal fashion
OWNX	in previous work  citation , we have addressed these two questions in the context of fixed-rate lossy block coding of stationary memoryless ( iid  ) continuous-alphabet sources with parameter space  symbol  a bounded subset of  symbol  for some finite  symbol
MISC	we have shown that, under appropriate regularity conditions on the distortion measure and on the source models, there exist joint universal schemes for lossy coding and source identification whose redundancies (that is, the gap between the actual performance and the theoretical optimum given by the shannon distortion-rate function) and source estimation fidelity both converge to zero as  symbol , as the block length  symbol  tends to infinity
MISC	assumption, which is rather restrictive as it excludes many practically relevant model classes (e g , autoregressive sources, or markov and hidden markov processes)
OWNX	furthermore, the assumption that the parameter space  symbol  is bounded may not always hold, at least in the sense that we may not know the diameter of  symbol   a priori
AIMX	in this paper we relax both of these assumptions and study the existence and the performance of universal schemes for joint lossy coding and identification of stationary sources satisfying a mixing condition, when the sources are assumed to belong to a parametric model class  symbol ,  symbol  being an open subset of  symbol  for some finite  symbol
OWNX	furthermore, comparing the rate at which the lagrangian redundancy decays to zero under our scheme with the  symbol  result of chou, effros and gray  citation , whose universal scheme is not aimed at identification, we immediately see that, in ensuring to satisfy the twin objectives of compression and modeling, we inevitably sacrifice some compression performance
OWNX	section~ introduces notation and basic concepts related to sources, codes and vapnik--chervonenkis classes
OWNX	section~ lists and discusses the regularity conditions that have to be satisfied by the source model class, and contains the statement of our result
OWNX	the result is proved in section~
OWNX	next, in section~ we give three examples of parametric source families (namely,  iid 
OWNX	we conclude in section~ and outline directions for future research
MISC	the problem of statistical learning is to construct an accurate predictor of a random variable as a function of a correlated random variable on the basis of an  iid  \ training sample from their joint distribution
MISC	allowable predictors are constrained to lie in some specified class, and the goal is to approach asymptotically the performance of the best predictor in the class
MISC	let  symbol  and  symbol  be jointly distributed random variables
MISC	the problem of statistical learning is to design an accurate predictor of the  output variable   symbol  from the  input variable   symbol  on the basis of a number of independent  training samples  drawn from their joint distribution, with very little or no prior knowledge of that distribution
MISC	this problem of  learning under communication constraints  arises in a variety of contexts, such as distributed estimation using a sensor network, adaptive control, or repeated games
OWNX	in these and other scenarios, it is often the case that the agents who gather the training data are geographically separated from the agents who use these data to make inferences and decisions, and communication between these two types of agents is possible only over rate-limited channels
MISC	hence, there is a trade-off between the communication rate and the quality of the inference, and it is of interest to characterize this trade-off mathematically
OWNX	whereas  citation  has looked at schemes where the finite-rate description of the training data was obtained through vector quantization, effectively imposing a separation structure between compression and learning, here we remove this restriction
OWNX	we show that, under certain regularity conditions, there is no penalty for compression of the training sequence in the setting (a)
MISC	this is due to the fact that the encoder can reliably estimate the underlying distribution (in the metric specifically tailored for the learning problem at hand) and then communicate the finite-rate description to the learning agent, who can then find the optimum predictor for the estimated distribution
MISC	the setting (b), however, is radically different: because the encoder has no access to the input part of the training sample, it cannot estimate the underlying distribution
MISC	instead, the encoder constructs a finite-rate description of the output part using a specific kind of a vector quantizer, namely one designed to minimize the expected distance between the underlying distribution (whatever it may happen to be) and the empirical distribution of the input/quantized output pairs
MISC	they assumed that the underlying probability distribution is known, and the rate constraint arises from the limitations on the memory of the learning agent; then the problem is to design the best possible classifier (without any constraints on its structure)
MISC	the motivation for the work in  citation  comes from biologically inspired models of learning
OWNX	planned future work includes obtaining converse theorems (lower bounds) and applying our formalism to specific classes of predictors used in statistical learning theory
MISC	if fisher  information matrix at the true distribution is singular,  then it has been left unknown what we can estimate about the  true distribution from random samples
MISC	assume that  symbol  is a probability space and that   symbol  is an  symbol -valued random variable which is subject to a simultaneous probability density function,   symbol  where  symbol  is a probability density function on  symbol ,  symbol  is a constant,  symbol  is a measurable function from  symbol  to  symbol , and  symbol  is the euclidean norm of  symbol
MISC	assume that  symbol  is a set of random variables which are independently subject to the same probability distribution as  symbol
MISC	let  symbol  be a function from  symbol  to  symbol
MISC	the square error  symbol  is a real function on  symbol ,   symbol  an expectation operator  symbol  on  symbol  is defined by  symbol } where  symbol  is a measurable function,   symbol  is a probability density function on  symbol , and   symbol  is a constant called an inverse temperature
MISC	note that  symbol  is not a constant but a random variable because  symbol  depends on random variables
MISC	two random variables  symbol  and  symbol  are defined by  symbol *} these random variables  symbol  and  symbol  are called the generalization  and training errors respectively
MISC	since  symbol , it is expected  on some natural conditions that  both  symbol  and  symbol  converge to  symbol   when  symbol  tends to infinity  if there exists  symbol  such that  symbol
MISC	if fisher information matrix   symbol  where  symbol , is positive definite for arbitrary  symbol , then this problem  is well known as a regular regression problem
MISC	in fact,  in a regular regression problem, convergences   symbol  and   symbol  hold
MISC	however, if  symbol  is singular, that is to say, if  symbol , then the problem is called a singular regression problem and convergences of  symbol  and  symbol  have been left unknown
MISC	in general it has been difficult to study a limit theorem  for the case when fisher information matrix is singular
AIMX	in this paper we prove a new limit theorem for the singular regression problem, which enables us to estimate birational invariants from random samples
MISC	if the function  symbol  is defined by   symbol  and  symbol , then the set  symbol  is not one point, and fisher information matrix at  symbol   is singular
MISC	a lot of functions used in statistics, information science, brain informatics,  and bio-informatics are singular, for example, artificial neural networks, radial basis functions, and wavelet functions
MISC	let  symbol  be an  symbol  matrix of rank  symbol ,  and assume that a uniformly random subset  symbol   of its entries is observed
OWNX	the complexity of our algorithm is  symbol , which opens the way to its use for massive  data sets
OWNX	in the process of proving these statements, we obtain a generalization of a celebrated result by friedman-kahn-szemer\'edi and feige-ofek on the spectrum of sparse random  matrices
MISC	can this inference problem be solved efficiently
MISC	the second question is particularly important in view of the  massive size of actual data sets
OWNX	we consider the least-square linear regression problem with regularization by the  symbol -norm, a problem usually referred to as the lasso
OWNX	for various decays of the regularization parameter, we compute asymptotic equivalents of the probability of correct model selection
MISC	this novel variable selection procedure, referred to as the bolasso, is extended to high-dimensional settings by a provably consistent two-step procedure
MISC	in the context of least-square linear regression, the problem is usually referred to as the  lasso ~ citation  or  basis pursuit ~ citation
MISC	much of the early effort has been dedicated to algorithms to solve the optimization problem efficiently, either through first-order methods~ citation , or through homotopy methods that leads to the entire regularization path (i e , the set of solutions for all values of the regularization parameters) at the cost of a single matrix inversion~ citation
MISC	a well-known property of the  regularization by the  symbol -norm is the  sparsity  of the solutions, i e ,  it leads to  loading vectors with many zeros, and thus performs model selection on top of regularization
MISC	in particular, in low correlation settings, the lasso is indeed consistent
MISC	however, in presence of strong correlations between relevant variables and irrelevant variables, the lasso cannot be model-consistent, shedding light on potential problems of such procedures for variable selection
MISC	various extensions of the lasso have been designed to fix its inconsistency, based on thresholding~ citation , data-dependent weights~ citation  or two-step procedures~ citation
MISC	note that recent work~ citation  has also looked at resampling methods for the lasso, but focuses on resampling the weights of the  symbol -norm rather than resampling the observations (see \mysec{support} for more details)
OWNX	if several datasets generated from the same distribution were available, then the latter property  would suggest to consider the intersection of the supports of the lasso estimates for each dataset: all relevant variables would always be selected for all datasets, while irrelevant variables would enter the models randomly, and intersecting the supports from sufficiently many different datasets would simply eliminate them
MISC	however, in practice, only one dataset is given; but resampling methods such as the  bootstrap  are exactly dedicated to mimic the availability of several datasets by resampling from the same unique dataset~ citation
OWNX	finally, our bolasso framework could be seen as a voting scheme applied to the supports of the bootstrap lasso estimates; however, our procedure may rather be considered as a consensus combination scheme, as we keep the (largest) subset of variables on which  all  regressors agree in terms of variable selection, which is in our case provably consistent and also allows to get rid of a potential additional hyperparameter
OWNX	we consider the two usual ways of using the bootstrap in regression settings, namely bootstrapping pairs and bootstrapping residuals~ citation
OWNX	in \mysec{support}, we show that the two types of bootstrap lead to consistent model selection in low-dimensional settings
OWNX	while we are currently unable to prove the consistency of bootstrapping residuals in high-dimensional settings, we prove in \mysec{highdim} the model consistency of a related two-step procedure:  the lasso is run once on the original data, with a larger regularization parameter, and then bootstrap replications (pairs or residuals) are run within the support of the first lasso estimation
OWNX	we show in \mysec{highdim} that this procedure is consistent
OWNX	in order to do so, we consider new sufficient conditions for the consistency of the lasso, which do not rely on sparse eigenvalues~ citation , low correlations~ citation  or finer conditions~ citation
OWNX	in \mysec{algorithms}, we derive efficient algorithms for the bootstrapped versions of the lasso
OWNX	finally, in \mysec{experiments-low} and \mysec{experiments-high}, we illustrate our results on synthetic examples, in low-dimensional and high-dimensional settings
OWNX	we also denote by  symbol  its  symbol -norm
OWNX	we let denote  symbol  and  symbol  the largest and smallest eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix  symbol
MISC	for    symbol ,  symbol  denotes the sign of  symbol , defined as  symbol  if  symbol ,  symbol  if  symbol , and  symbol  if  symbol
MISC	for a vector  symbol ,  symbol  denotes the   vector of signs of elements of  symbol
MISC	given a set  symbol ,  symbol  is the indicator function of the set  symbol
MISC	moreover, given a vector  symbol  and a subset  symbol  of  symbol ,  symbol  denotes the vector in  symbol  of elements of  symbol  indexed by  symbol
MISC	similarly, for a matrix  symbol ,  symbol   denotes the submatrix of   symbol  composed of elements of  symbol  whose rows are in  symbol  and columns are in  symbol
MISC	moreover,  symbol  denotes the cardinal of the set  symbol
OWNX	we study boosting algorithms from a new perspective
OWNX	we show that the lagrange dual problems of  symbol  norm regularized \adaboost, and soft-margin with generalized hinge loss  are all entropy maximization problems
OWNX	we also theoretically prove that, approximately,  symbol  norm regularized  maximizes the average margin, instead of the minimum margin
OWNX	we show that they exhibit almost identical classification results to that of standard stage-wise additive boosting algorithms but  with much faster convergence rates
OWNX	therefore fewer weak classifiers are needed to build the ensemble using our proposed optimization technique
MISC	\ieeeparstart{b}{oosting}  has attracted a lot of research interests since the first practical boosting algorithm, \adaboost, was introduced by freund and schapire  citation
MISC	the machine learning community has spent much effort on understanding how the algorithm works  citation
MISC	however, up to date there are still questions about the success of boosting that are left unanswered   citation
MISC	in boosting,  one is given a set of training examples  symbol , with binary labels  symbol  being either  symbol  or  symbol
OWNX	a boosting algorithm finds a convex linear  combination of weak classifiers (base learners, weak hypotheses) that can achieve much better classification accuracy than an individual base classifier
MISC	to do so, there are two unknown variables to be optimized
OWNX	the first one is the base classifiers
OWNX	an oracle is needed to produce base classifiers
OWNX	the second one is the positive weights associated with each base classifier
MISC	is one of the first and the most popular boosting algorithms for classification
MISC	later, various boosting algorithms have been advocated
MISC	for example,  by friedman  citation  replaces \adaboost's exponential cost function with the function of logistic regression
MISC	the authors of  citation   consider boosting algorithms with a generalized additive model framework
MISC	schapire  citation  showed  that converges to a large margin solution
MISC	however, recently it is pointed out that  does not converge to the maximum margin solution  citation
MISC	motivated by the success of the margin theory associated with support vector machines (svms), was invented by   citation  with the intuition of maximizing the minimum margin of all training examples
MISC	the final optimization problem can be formulated as a linear program (lp)
MISC	it is observed that the hard-margin does not perform well in most cases although it usually produces larger minimum margins
MISC	more often has worse generalization performance
MISC	in other words, a higher minimum margin would not necessarily  imply a lower test error
MISC	breiman  citation  also noticed the same phenomenon: his algorithm has a minimum margin that provably converges to the optimal but is inferior in terms of generalization capability
MISC	experiments on and have put the margin theory into serious doubt
MISC	until recently, reyzin and schapire  citation  re-ran breiman's experiments by controlling weak classifiers' complexity
MISC	they found that  the minimum margin is indeed larger for \arcgv, but the overall margin distribution is typically better for \adaboost
MISC	the conclusion is that the minimum margin is important, but not always at the expense of other factors
MISC	they also conjectured that maximizing the average margin, instead of the minimum margin, may result in better boosting algorithms
MISC	recent theoretical work  citation   has shown the important role of the margin distribution   on bounding the generalization error of combined classifiers such as boosting and bagging
MISC	as the soft-margin svm usually has a better classification accuracy than the hard-margin svm,  the soft-margin also performs better by relaxing  the constraints that all training examples must be correctly classified
MISC	cross-validation is required to determine an optimal value for the soft-margin trade-off parameter
MISC	r\"atsch  citation  showed the equivalence between svms and boosting-like algorithms
MISC	comprehensive overviews on boosting are given by  citation  and   citation
OWNX	we show in this work that the lagrange duals of  symbol  norm regularized \adaboost, and with generalized hinge loss are all   entropy maximization problems
MISC	previous work like      citation  noticed the connection between boosting techniques and entropy maximization based on bregman distances
OWNX	they did not   show that the duals of boosting algorithms are  actually entropy regularized as we show in  \eqref{eq:dual_ada0},  \eqref{eq:lpboost10} and \eqref{eq:dual_logit1}
OWNX	by knowing this duality equivalence,  we derive a general column generation (cg) based optimization framework that can be used to optimize arbitrary convex loss functions
OWNX	our major contributions are the following:    we derive the lagrangian duals of boosting algorithms and show that most of them are entropy maximization problems
MISC	the authors of  citation   conjectured that                   ``it may be fruitful to consider boosting algorithms that greedily maximize the average or median margin rather than the minimum one''
OWNX	we theoretically prove that, actually,  symbol   norm regularized approximately maximizes the average margin, instead of the minimum margin
OWNX	we propose \adaboost-qp that directly optimizes the asymptotic cost function of \adaboost
OWNX	furthermore, based on the duals we derive, we design column generation based optimization techniques for boosting learning
OWNX	we show that the new algorithms have almost identical results to that of standard stage-wise additive boosting algorithms but with much faster convergence rates
MISC	therefore fewer weak classifiers are needed to build the ensemble
OWNX	we use capital letters  symbol  to denote matrices
MISC	all vectors are column vectors unless otherwise specified
MISC	the inner product of two column vectors  symbol  and  symbol  are  symbol
MISC	symbol  and  symbol  are column vectors with each entry being  symbol  and  symbol  respectively
MISC	the length will be clear from the context
MISC	the abbreviation  symbol  means ``subject to''
OWNX	we denote the domain of a function  symbol  as  symbol
OWNX	section  briefly reviews several boosting algorithms for self-completeness
OWNX	their corresponding duals are derived in section
OWNX	our main results are also presented in section
OWNX	in section , we then present numerical experiments to illustrate various aspects of our new algorithms obtained in section
MISC	in a recent breakthrough, [bshouty et al , 2005] obtained the first passive-lear\-ning algorithm for dnfs under the uniform distribution
MISC	they showed that dnfs are learnable  in the random walk and noise sensitivity models
OWNX	we extend their results in several directions
OWNX	in contrast, we show that a cyclic version of the random walk model allows to learn efficiently  polynomially weighted thresholds of parities
OWNX	we also extend the algorithm of bshouty et al to the case of unions of rectangles, a natural generalization of dnfs to  symbol
MISC	in~ citation , it was shown that dnfs can be learned  using membership queries, a form of active learning
MISC	the use of harmonic analysis in the study of boolean functions was introduced in~ citation
MISC	the harmonic analysis  used in the \hs\ algorithm is based on a parity-finding algorithm of goldreich and levin~ citation , which  was first applied to a learning problem by kushilevitz and mansour~ citation
MISC	hypothesis boosting, a technique to reduce the classification error of a learning algorithm, was introduced by schapire~ citation
MISC	the boosting algorithm used by \hs\ is actually due to freund~ citation
MISC	in a recent breakthrough, bshouty et al ~ citation  obtained the first passive learning algorithm for dnfs
MISC	that variant of \hs, called bounded sieve (\bs),  was first obtained in~ citation
MISC	in~ citation , \bs\ was used to learn dnfs under the uniform distribution in two natural passive learning models
MISC	the first one is the random walk model, where examples, instead of being  iid  , follow a random walk on the  boolean cube (see also~ citation  for related work)
MISC	the second model is the closely related noise sensitivity model, where this time examples come in pairs, the second instance being a noisy version of the first one
MISC	the results of~ citation  are interesting in that they give a learning algorithm for dnfs in a case where the observer has no control over the examples provided
MISC	however the problem of learning dnfs under the uniform distribution when examples are  iid 
MISC	still remains open
MISC	it is known that dnfs cannot be learned in the more restrictive statistical query model (introduced in~ citation ) where one can ask only about statistics over random examples~ citation
MISC	jackson~ citation  also showed that \hs\ applies to thresholds of parities (top), a class that can express dnfs and decision trees with only polynomial increase in size, and extended his algorithm to the non-boolean case of unions of rectangles, a generalization of dnfs to  symbol  (where  symbol )
MISC	whether those classes of functions can be learned in the random walk and noise sensitivity models was left open by~ citation
OWNX	our contribution is threefold
OWNX	we first show that tops cannot be learned in the noise sensitivity model using statistical queries (sqs)
MISC	this does not rule out the possibility of learning tops in the random walk model although it provides evidence that the techniques of~ citation  cannot be easily extended to that case
MISC	this seems to be the first not-too-contrived passive model in which tops are efficiently learnable with respect to the uniform distribution
OWNX	actually, one can perform the harmonic sieve in this cyclic random walk model, and we also show that this model is strictly weaker than the active setting under a standard cryptographic assumption
MISC	this last result turns out to be rather straightforward once the proper analogues to the boolean case are found
OWNX	in section~, we introduce the learning models and give a brief review of fourier analysis
OWNX	the negative result for learning tops is derived in section~
OWNX	scenarios for the emergence or bootstrap of a lexicon involve the repeated interaction between at least two agents  who must reach a consensus on how to name  symbol  objects using   symbol  words
OWNX	here we consider minimal models of  two types of learning algorithms: cross-situational learning, in which the individuals determine the meaning of a  word by looking for something in common across all observed uses of that word, and supervised operant conditioning learning,  in which there is strong feedback between individuals about the intended meaning of the words
OWNX	despite the  stark differences between these learning schemes, we show that they yield the same communication accuracy in the realistic  limits of large   symbol  and  symbol , which coincides with the result of the classical occupancy problem of randomly  assigning  symbol  objects to  symbol   words
MISC	how a coherent lexicon can emerge in a group of interacting agents is a major open issue in the language evolution and  acquisition research area (hurford, 1989; nowak \& krakauer, 1999; steels, 2002; kirby, 2002; smith, kirby, \& brighton, 2003)
MISC	in addition, the dynamics in the self-organization of shared lexicons is one of the issues to which computational and mathematical  modeling can contribute the most, as the emergence of a lexicon from scratch implies some type of self-organization and, possibly,  threshold phenomenon
MISC	this cannot be completely understood without a thorough exploration of the parameter space of the models  (baronchelli, felici, loreto, caglioli, \& steels, 2006)
MISC	the first approach,  inspired by the seminal work of pinker and bloom (1990) who argued that natural selection is the main design principle  to explain the emergence and complex structure of language, resorts to evolutionary algorithms to evolve the shared lexicon
MISC	the key element here is that an improvement on the communication ability of an individual results, in average, in an increase  of the number of offspring it produces (hurford, 1989; nowak \& krakauer, 1999; cangelosi, 2001; fontanari \& perlovsky, 2007, 2008)
MISC	of course, if there is a fact about language which is uncontroversial, it is that the lexicon must be learned from the active or  passive interaction between children and language-proficient adults
MISC	the issue of whether this ability to learn the lexicon is  due to some domain-general learning mechanism, or  is an innate ability, unique to humans, is still on the table (bates \& elman, 1996)
OWNX	nevertheless, in this contribution  we will use many insights produced by research on language acquisition by children (see, eg , gleitman, 1990; bloom, 2000) to  study different learning strategies
MISC	from a developmental perspective, there are basically two competing schemes for lexicon acquisition by children  (rosenthal \& zimmerman, 1978)
MISC	the first scheme, termed cross-situational or observational learning, is based on the  intuitive idea that one way that a learner can determine the meaning of a word is to find something in common across all  observed uses of that word (pinker, 1984; gleitman, 1990; siskind, 1996)
MISC	hence learning takes place through the statistical  sampling of the contexts in which a word appears
OWNX	since the learner receives no feedback about its inferences, we refer to  this scheme as unsupervised learning
MISC	this supervised learning scheme has been applied to the design of a system for communication by  autonomous robots -- the so-called language game in the talking heads experiments (steels, 2003)
MISC	despite the technological  appeal, the empirical evidence is that most part of the lexicon is acquired by children as a product of unsupervised learning  (pinker, 1984; gleitman, 1990; bloom, 2000)
MISC	many different computational implementations and variants of these two schemes for bootstrapping a lexicon have  been proposed in the literature
MISC	for example, smith (2003a, 2003b), smith, smith, blythe, \& vogt (2006),  and de beule, de vylder, \& belpaeme (2006) have addressed the unsupervised learning scheme,  whereas steels \& kaplan (1999), ke, minett, au, wang (2002), smith, kirby, \& brighton, (2003),  and  lenaerts, jansen,  tuyls, \& de vylder (2005), the supervised scheme
OWNX	in fact, in this contribution we show that in  a realistic limit of very large lexicon sizes the supervised and unsupervised learning performances are essentially identical
MISC	it overcomes several fundamental problems which other approaches to uncertainty suffer from
MISC	yet, to be useful in practice, one needs efficient ways for computing the imprecise=robust sets or intervals
MISC	this work derives interval estimates under the imprecise dirichlet model (idm)  citation  for a large class of statistical estimators
MISC	the prior uncertainty about  symbol  is modeled by a set of dirichlet priors  symbol , where%  %  symbol , and  symbol  is a hyper-parameter, typically chosen between 1 and 2
MISC	sets of probability distributions are often called imprecise probabilities, hence the name idm for this model
MISC	the idm overcomes several fundamental problems which other approaches to uncertainty suffer from  citation
MISC	for instance, the idm satisfies the representation invariance principle and the symmetry principle, which are mutually exclusive in a pure bayesian treatment with proper prior  citation
MISC	statistical estimators  symbol  usually also depend on the chosen prior: so a set of priors leads to a set of estimators  symbol
MISC	for instance, the expected chances  symbol  lead to a robust interval estimate  symbol
MISC	robust intervals for the variance  symbol   citation  and for the mean and variance of linear-combinations  symbol  have also been derived  citation
OWNX	bayesian estimators (like expectations) depend on  symbol  and  symbol  only through  symbol  (and  symbol  which we suppress), i e \  symbol
MISC	walley suggests, for instance, to use  symbol  for inference problems and  symbol  for decision problems  citation , where  symbol  is some function of  symbol
MISC	one application is the inference of robust tree-dependency structures  citation , in which edges are partially ordered based on imprecise mutual information
OWNX	section  gives a brief introduction to the idm and describes our problem setup
OWNX	in section  we derive exact robust intervals for concave functions  symbol , such as the entropy
OWNX	section  derives approximate robust intervals for arbitrary  symbol
OWNX	in section  we show how bounds of elementary functions can be used to get bounds for composite function, especially for sums and products of functions
OWNX	the results are used in section  for deriving robust intervals for the mutual information
OWNX	the issue of how to set up idm models on product spaces is discussed in section
OWNX	section  addresses the problem of how to combine bayesian credible intervals with the robust intervals of the idm
OWNX	conclusions are given in section
MISC	it is known that when gabp converges it converges to the correct map estimate of the gaussian  random vector and simple sufficient conditions for its  convergence have been established
OWNX	our method computes the correct map estimate even in cases where standard gabp would not have converged
OWNX	as a case study, we discuss the linear detection problem
OWNX	we show that using our new construction, we are able to force convergence of montanari's linear detection algorithm, in cases where it would originally fail
MISC	gabp is also linked to the canonical problem of solving systems of linear equations~ citation , one of the fundamental problems in computer science and engineering, which explains the large number of algorithm variants and applications
OWNX	for example, the gabp algorithm is applied for signal processing~ citation , multiuser detection~ citation , linear programming~ citation , ranking in social networks~ citation , support vector machines~ citation  furthermore, it was recently shown that some existing algorithms are specific instances of the gabp algorithm, including consensus propagation~ citation , local probability propagation~ citation , multiuser detection~ citation , quadratic min-sum algorithm~ citation , turbo decoding with gaussian densities~ citation  and others
MISC	two general sufficient conditions for convergence of gabp in loopy graphs are known: diagonal-dominance  citation  and walk-summability  citation
MISC	see also numerous studies in specific settings~ citation
OWNX	as a specific application, we discuss montanari's multiuser detection algorithm~ citation
OWNX	by using our construction we are able to show convergence in practical cdma settings, where the original algorithm did not converge, supporting a significantly higher number of users on each cell
OWNX	section  outlines the problem model
OWNX	section  gives a brief introduction to the gabp algorithm
OWNX	section  describes our novel double-loop construction for positive definite matrices
OWNX	section  extends the construction for computing least-squares solution of general linear systems
OWNX	we provide experimental results of deploying our construction in the linear detection context in section
OWNX	we conclude in section
MISC	there is a large body of research on grammar inference within the theory of formal languages
MISC	however, there is surprisingly little known on grammar inference for graph grammars
MISC	specifically, we characterize, given a set of disjoint and isomorphic subgraphs of a graph  symbol , whether or not there is a nlc graph grammar rule which can generate these subgraphs to obtain  symbol
MISC	this leads naturally to consider the more involved ``non-confluent'' graph grammar rules
MISC	grammar inference, also called grammar induction, is a general line of research where one is concerned with determining a ``simple'' grammar that is consistent with a given set of possible and impossible outcomes
MISC	hence, one ``goes back'' in the derivation: instead of determining the generative power of a grammar, one determines the grammar given the generated output
MISC	this topic is well-studied for formal languages, especially with respect to context-free languages, see eg citation , however, relatively little is known for graph grammars
MISC	the topic of inference of graph grammars is considered in  citation  and uses their so-called subdue scheme developed in  citation
MISC	there it is characterized, given a set  symbol  of non-touching isomorphic graphs of a graph  symbol , whether or not there is a graph grammar consisting of one rule able to generate the graphs of  symbol  to obtain  symbol
OWNX	we continue this research and generalize this result for the case where these graphs are disjoint instead of non-touching
MISC	most notably, one has to deal with non-confluency issues: the generated graph depends on the order in which touching subgraphs are generated \addconf{due to space constraints, proofs of the results are omitted, but can be found in an extended version
MISC	
MISC	this is because the resulting planning task takes the form of a dynamic programming problem on a belief tree with an infinite number of states
MISC	the bounds are then used to create more efficient strategies for exploring the tree
MISC	in recent work~ citation , bayesian methods for exploration in markov decision processes (mdps) and for solving known partially-observable markov decision processes (pomdps), as well as for exploration in the latter case, have been proposed
MISC	all such methods suffer from computational intractability problems for most domains of interest
MISC	the sources of intractability are two-fold
MISC	firstly, there may be no compact representation of the current belief
MISC	this is especially true for pomdps
MISC	this tree grows large very fast, and it is particularly problematic to grow in the case of continuous observations or actions
OWNX	in this work, we concentrate on the second problem -- and consider algorithms for expanding the tree
MISC	for the simplest exploration-exploitation trade-off setting, bandit problems, there already exist nearly optimal, computationally simple methods~ citation
MISC	such methods have recently been extended to tree search~ citation
MISC	this work proposes to take advantage of the special structure of belief trees in order to design nearly-optimal algorithms for expansion of nodes
OWNX	in a sense, by recognising that the tree expansion problem in bayesian look-ahead exploration methods is also an optimal exploration problem, we develop tree algorithms that can solve this problem efficiently
OWNX	furthermore, we are able to derive interesting upper and lower bounds for the value of branches and leaf nodes which can help limit the amount of search
OWNX	the remainder of this section introduces the augmented mdp formalism employed within this work and discusses related work
OWNX	section~ discusses tree expansion in exploration problems and introduces some useful bounds
OWNX	these bounds are used in the algorithms detailed in section~, which are then evaluated in section~
OWNX	we conclude with an outlook to further developments
MISC	frequent episode discovery is a popular framework for pattern discovery in event streams
MISC	an episode is a partially ordered set of nodes with each node associated with an event type
MISC	efficient (and separate) algorithms exist for episode discovery when the associated partial order is total  (serial episode) and trivial (parallel episode)
MISC	these algorithms can be easily specialized to discover serial or parallel episodes
OWNX	simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms
MISC	the data in this framework is a single long time-ordered  stream of events and each temporal pattern (called an episode) is essentially a small, partially ordered  collection of nodes, with each node associated with a symbol (called event-type)
MISC	patterns with a total order on their nodes are called  serial  episodes, while those with an empty partial order are called  parallel  episodes  citation
MISC	related work can be found in the context of sequential patterns  citation  where the data consists of multiple sequences and the sequential pattern is a small partially ordered collection of symbols
MISC	a sequential pattern is considered frequent  if there are enough sequences (in the data) in  which the pattern    occurs  atleast once
MISC	this makes the computational task quite different from that in sequential patterns
MISC	we restrict our attention to a subclass of patterns called  injective  episodes, where an event-type cannot appear more than once in a given episode
OWNX	our algorithms can be easily specialized to either discover only frequent serial episodes or only frequent parallel episodes
MISC	as we point out here, one of the difficulties in efficient discovery of general partial orders is that    there is an inherent combinatorial explosion in the number of frequent episodes of any given size
MISC	this is because, for any partial order episode with  symbol  nodes,  there are an exponential number of subepisodes, also of size  symbol , all of which would occur at least as often as the episode (note that this problem does not arise in, eg , frequent serial episode discovery   because an  symbol -node serial episode cannot have any  symbol -node serial subepisode)
OWNX	to tackle this,    we propose a  new  measure called  bidirectional evidence , which captures some notion of entropy of relative frequencies of pairs of events occurring in either order   in the observed occurrences of an episode
MISC	the mining procedure now requires a user-defined threshold on bidirectional evidence in addition to the usual frequency threshold
OWNX	we demonstrate the utility of our  algorithms through extensive empirical studies
OWNX	in sec ~, we briefly review the frequent episodes formalism  and define injective episodes
MISC	recently, different works proposed a new way to mine patterns in databases with pathological size
MISC	for example, experiments in genome biology usually provide databases with thousands of attributes (genes) but only tens of objects (experiments)
MISC	in this case, mining the ``transposed'' database runs through a smaller search space, and the galois connection allows to infer the closed patterns of the original database
OWNX	we focus here on constrained pattern mining for those unusual databases and give a theoretical framework for database and constraint transposition
OWNX	we discuss the properties of constraint transposition and look into classical constraints
OWNX	finally, we show how to generate all the patterns satisfying the constraint from the closed ones
MISC	frequent pattern mining is now well mastered, but these patterns, like association rules, reveal to be too numerous for the experts and very expensive to compute
MISC	they have to be filtered or constrained
MISC	however, mining and constraining have to be done jointly (pushing the constraint) in order to avoid combinatorial explosion~ citation
MISC	mining under complex constraint has become today a hot topic and the subject of numerous works (e g ,~ citation )
MISC	in genome biology, biological experiments are very expensive and time consuming
MISC	therefore, only a small number of these experiments can be processed
MISC	however, thanks to new devices (such as biochips), experiments can provide the measurements of the activity of thousands of genes
MISC	this leads to databases with lots of columns (the genes) and few rows (the experiments)
MISC	numerous works present efficient algorithms which mine the patterns satisfying a user defined constraint in large databases
MISC	this constraint can combine minimum and maximum frequency threshold together with other syntactical constraints
MISC	however, their complexity is exponential in the number of columns and thus they are not suited for databases with too many columns, like those encountered in genome biology
MISC	therefore the ``transposed'' database has significantly less columns than the original one
MISC	both approaches use the transposition principle, however the problem of mining under constraints is not fully studied, specially for complex constraints (i e , conjunction and disjunction of simple constraints)
OWNX	our aim is to use classical algorithms (constrained pattern mining algorithms or closed patterns mining algorithms) in the ``transposed'' database and to use their output to regenerate patterns of the original database instead of directly mining in the original database
MISC	is it possible to ``transpose'' the constraints  i e , given a database and a constraint, is it possible to find a ``transposed'' constraint such that  mining the ``transposed'' database with the ``transposed'' constraint gives information about the patterns which satisfy the original constraint in the original database
OWNX	then we show in sec ~ how to transpose usual and complex constraints
OWNX	section~ is a complete discussion about mining constrained closed patterns using the ``transposed'' database and in sec ~ we show how to use this to compute all (i e , not only closed) the patterns satisfying a constraint
OWNX	we consider multi-label prediction problems with large output spaces under the assumption of  output sparsity  -- that the target (label) vectors have small support
OWNX	we develop a general theory for a variant of the popular error correcting output code scheme, using ideas from compressed sensing for exploiting this sparsity
AIMX	we show that the number of subproblems need only be logarithmic in the total number of possible labels, making this approach radically more efficient than others
OWNX	we also state and prove robustness guarantees for this method in the form of regret transform bounds (in general), and also provide a more detailed analysis for the linear prediction setting
MISC	suppose we have a large database of images, and we want to learn to predict who or what is in any given one
MISC	a standard approach to this task is to collect a sample of these images  symbol  along with corresponding labels  symbol , where  symbol  if and only if person or object  symbol  is depicted in image  symbol , and then feed the labeled sample to a multi-label learning algorithm
MISC	when  symbol  is very large ( eg ~ symbol ,  symbol ), the simple one-against-all approach of learning a single predictor for each entity can become prohibitively expensive, both at training and testing time
OWNX	our motivation for the present work comes from the observation that although the output (label) space may be very high dimensional, the actual labels are often sparse
MISC	that is, in each image, only a small number of entities may be present and there may only be a small amount of ambiguity in who or what they are
AIMX	in this work, we consider how this sparsity in the output space, or  output sparsity , eases the burden of large-scale multi-label learning {exploiting output sparsity } a subtle but critical point that distinguishes output sparsity from more common notions of sparsity (say, in feature or weight vectors) is that we are interested in the sparsity of  symbol  rather than  symbol
MISC	in general,  symbol  may be sparse while the actual outcome  symbol  may not ( eg ~if there is much unbiased noise); and, vice versa,  symbol  may be sparse with probability one but  symbol  may have large support ( eg ~if there is little distinction between several labels)
OWNX	conventional linear algebra suggests that we must predict  symbol  parameters in order to find the value of the  symbol -dimensional vector  symbol  for each  symbol
OWNX	this is the basis of our approach {our contributions } we show how to apply algorithms for compressed sensing to the output coding approach  citation
MISC	'', solves these problems, and then uses their solution to predict the final label
OWNX	rather, we  learn to predict compressed label vectors , and then use sparse reconstruction algorithms to  recover uncompressed labels from these predictions
MISC	robustness guarantees, in the form of regret transform bounds (in general) and a further detailed analysis for the linear prediction setting {prior work } the ubiquity of multi-label prediction problems in domains ranging from multiple object recognition in computer vision to automatic keyword tagging for content databases has spurred the development of numerous general methods for the task
MISC	perhaps the most straightforward approach is the well-known one-against-all reduction~ citation , but this can be too expensive when the number of possible labels is large (especially if applied to the power set of the label space  citation )
MISC	when structure can be imposed on the label space ( eg ~class hierarchy), efficient learning and prediction methods are often possible~ citation
OWNX	here, we focus on a different type of structure, namely output sparsity, which is not addressed in previous work
MISC	recently, heuristics have been proposed for discovering structure in large output spaces that empirically offer some degree of efficiency~ citation
OWNX	relative to this work, we expand the scope of the approach to multi-label prediction and provide bounds on regret and error which guide the design of codes
MISC	the loss based decoding approach~ citation  suggests decoding so as to minimize loss
OWNX	however, it does not provide significant guidance in the choice of encoding method, or the feedback between encoding and decoding which we analyze here
MISC	the output coding approach is inconsistent when classifiers are used and the underlying problems being encoded are noisy
OWNX	our algorithms rely on several methods from compressed sensing, which we detail where used
OWNX	text of abstract we present a family of pairwise tournaments reducing  symbol -class classification to binary classification
MISC	these reductions are provably robust against a constant fraction of binary errors, simultaneously matching the best possible computation  symbol  and regret  symbol
MISC	the construction also works for robustly selecting the best of  symbol -choices by tournament
OWNX	we strengthen previous results by defeating a more powerful adversary than previously addressed while providing a new form of analysis
MISC	in this setting, the error correcting tournament has depth  symbol  while using  symbol  comparators, both optimal up to a small constant
MISC	a common general approach to multiclass learning is to reduce a multiclass problem to a set of binary classification  problems~ citation
MISC	this approach is composable with any binary learning algorithm, including online algorithms, bayesian algorithms, and even humans \shrink{ an alternative is to design a multiclass learning algorithm directly,  typically by extending an existing algorithm for binary classification
MISC	for example, the first and still commonly used multiclass versions of the support vector machine may not even converge to the best possible predictor no matter how many examples are used (see  citation )
MISC	informally, regret is the difference in loss between the predictor and the best possible predictor on the same problem
OWNX	here  regret  (formally defined in section~) is the difference between the incurred loss and the smallest achievable loss on the problem, i e , excess loss due to suboptimal prediction
MISC	the most commonly applied reduction is one-against-all, which creates a binary classification problem for each of the  symbol  classes
MISC	optimizing squared loss of the binary predictions instead of the  symbol  loss makes the approach consistent, but the resulting  multiclass regret scales as  symbol  in the worst case, where  symbol  is the average squared loss regret on the induced problems
MISC	the resulting multiclass regret is bounded by  symbol , removing the dependence on the number of classes  symbol
MISC	when only a constant number of labels have non-zero probability given features, the computation can be reduced to  symbol  per example~ citation
MISC	this state of the problem raises several questions:   is there a consistent reduction from multiclass to binary classification  that does not have a square root dependence on  symbol ~ citation
MISC	for example, an average binary regret of just  symbol  may imply a pecoc multiclass regret of  symbol
MISC	%at the level of  is there a consistent reduction  that requires just  symbol  computation,  matching the information theoretic lower bound
MISC	the well-known  symbol  tree reduction distinguishes between  the labels using a balanced binary tree, with each non-leaf node predicting ``is the correct multiclass label to the left or not
MISC	''~ citation
OWNX	as shown in section~, this method is inconsistent
MISC	one fear associated with the pecoc approach is that it creates binary problems of the form ``what is the probability that the label is in a given random subset of labels ,''  which may be hard to solve
MISC	although this fear is addressed by regret analysis (as the latter operates only on avoidable, excess loss), and is  overstated in some cases~ citation ,  it is still of some concern, especially with larger values of  symbol
MISC	the error-correcting tournament family presented here answers all of these questions in the affirmative
MISC	it provides an exponentially faster in  symbol  method for multiclass prediction with the resulting multiclass regret bounded by  symbol , where  symbol  is the average binary regret; and every binary classifier logically compares two distinct class labels
MISC	the result is based on a basic observation that if a non-leaf  node fails to predict its binary label, which may be unavoidable due to noise in the distribution,  nodes between this node and the root should have no preference for class label prediction
MISC	the decision process of a filter tree, viewed bottom up, can be viewed as a single-elimination tournament on a set of  symbol  players
MISC	using multiple independent single-elimination tournaments is of no use as it does not affect the  average  regret of an adversary controlling the binary classifiers
MISC	somewhat surprisingly, it is possible to have  symbol  complete single-elimination  tournaments between  symbol  players in  symbol  rounds, with no player playing twice in the same round
MISC	% ~ citation
MISC	an  error-correcting tournament ,  first pairs labels in such simultaneous single-elimination tournaments, followed by a final carefully weighted single-elimination tournament that decides among the  symbol  winners of the first phase
MISC	repeating the last comparison  symbol  times defeats this strategy
MISC	the result here is also useful for the actual problem of tournament construction in games with real players
MISC	in an  symbol - elimination bracket tournament , bracket  symbol  is a single-elimination tournament on all players except the winners of brackets  symbol
MISC	after the bracket winners are determined, the player winning the last bracket  symbol  plays the winner of bracket  symbol  repeatedly until one player has suffered  symbol  losses (they start with  symbol  and  symbol  losses respectively)
MISC	the winner moves on to pair against the winner of bracket  symbol , and the process continues until only one player remains
MISC	this method does not scale well to large  symbol , as the final elimination phase takes  symbol  rounds
AIMX	to see that the bracketed  symbol -elimination tournament does not satisfy our goal, note that the second-best player could defeat the first player in the first single elimination tournament, and then once more in the final elimination phase to win, implying that an adversary need control only two matches \paragraph{paper overview} we begin by defining the basic concepts and introducing some of the  notation in section~
OWNX	section~ shows that the simple divide-and-conquer tree approach is inconsistent, motivating the filter tree algorithm described in section~ (which applies to more general cost-sensitive multiclass problems)
OWNX	section~ proves that the algorithm has the best possible computational dependence, and gives two upper bounds on the regret of the returned (cost-sensitive) multiclass classifier
MISC	setting  symbol  gives regret ratio of  symbol  with depth  symbol
MISC	%, and which is only charged according to two labels conditional  section~ gives an algorithm independent lower bound of 2 on the regret ratio for large  symbol
OWNX	when the number of calls to a binary classifier is independent (or nearly independent) of the label predicted, we strengthen this lower bound to  symbol  for large  symbol
OWNX	we report a new optimal resolution for the statistical stratification problem under proportional sampling allocation among strata
MISC	a common procedure in sampling surveys is partitioning the elements of a population, before distributing the sample on it, in such a way to obtain most useful information from the data to be collected
MISC	this procedure is called stratification
MISC	it may have different aims, such as to guarantee obtaining information for some or all the geopolitical regions of a country, or to provide more precision in estimating population quantities by identifying strata with more homogeneous elements into them, according to one or more variables
OWNX	in this problem, we must divide a population of size  symbol  into  symbol  strata considering an auxiliary variable  symbol , also called the size variable, whose values are known for all units in the population
MISC	the first stratum is defined as the set of units in the population whose  symbol   values are lower than or equal to a constant value  symbol  , the second one as the set of units whose  symbol  values are greater than  symbol   and lower than or equal  to  symbol   and so on
MISC	based on this definition the stratum  symbol   symbol  is defined as the set of units in population with values of  symbol  belonging to the interval  symbol , where   symbol  are the boundaries of each stratum, and the stratum  symbol  corresponds to the set of observations which values are greater than  symbol
OWNX	in section 2, we present some basic concepts about stratified simple random sampling
OWNX	in section 3, we define the problem of stratification to be tackled in this work and offer a brief discussion about different approaches to this topic
OWNX	we propose, in section 4, an algorithm based on graph theory in order to provide exact solutions to the stratification problem defined in section 3
OWNX	finally, we present some computational results and considerations about the new algorithm
MISC	the problem of joint universal source coding and modeling, addressed by rissanen in the context of lossless codes, is generalized to fixed-rate lossy coding of continuous-alphabet memoryless sources
OWNX	we show that, for bounded distortion measures, any compactly parametrized family of  iid 
OWNX	we also present explicit examples of parametric sources admitting such joint universal compression and modeling schemes
MISC	in universal data compression, a single code achieves asymptotically optimal performance on all sources within a given family
MISC	intuition suggests that a good universal coder should acquire an accurate model of the source statistics from a sufficiently long data sequence and incorporate this knowledge in its operation
MISC	for lossless codes, this intuition has been made rigorous by rissanen  citation
MISC	sources with values in  symbol  for some finite  symbol
MISC	source with the marginal distribution of  symbol  belonging to some indexed class  symbol  of absolutely continuous distributions on  symbol , where  symbol  is a bounded subset of  symbol  for some  symbol
OWNX	we also describe an extension of our scheme to unbounded distortion measures satisfying a certain moment condition, and present two examples of parametric families satisfying the regularity conditions of theorem~
MISC	this ability to simultaneously model and compress the data may prove useful in such applications as  media forensics   citation , where the parameter  symbol  could represent evidence of tampering, and the aim is to compress the data in such a way that the evidence can be later extracted with high fidelity from the compressed version
MISC	in a way, vapnik--chervonenkis estimates can be thought of as an (imperfect) analogue of the combinatorial method of types for finite alphabets  citation
OWNX	our approach is to directly approximate an optimal strategic tree depending on the observation
OWNX	this approximation is made by means of a parameterized probabilistic law
MISC	a particular family of hidden markov models, with input  and  output, is considered as a model of policy
MISC	there are different degrees of difficulty in planning and control problems
MISC	there are several transition rules, which condition the sequence of decision
OWNX	for example, a robot may be required to move from room a, starting state, to room b, final state; its decision could be  go forward ,  turn right  or  turn left , and it cannot cross a wall; these are the conditions over the decision
MISC	a first degree in the difficulty is to find at least one solution for the planning
MISC	when the states are only partially known or the resulting actions are not deterministic, the difficulty is quite enhanced: the planner has to take into account the various observations
MISC	for example, find the shortest trajectory which moves the robot from room a to room b
MISC	there are again different degrees in the difficulty, depending on the problem to be deterministic or not, depending on the model of the future observations
MISC	this solution has been extended to the case of partial observation (partially observable markov decision process/pomdp), but this solution is generally not practicable, owing to the huge dimension of the variables citation  \\\\ for such reason, different methods for approximating this problem has been introduced
MISC	for example, reinforcement learning methods  citation  are able to learn an evaluation table of the decision conditionnally to the known universe states and an observation short range
MISC	in this case, the range of observation is indeed limited in time, because of an exponential grow of the table to learn
MISC	recent works citation  are investigating the case of hierarchical rl, in order to go beyond this range limitation
MISC	whatever, these methods are generally based on an additivity hypothesis about the reward
MISC	another viewpoint is based on the direct learning of the policy citation
OWNX	our approach is of this kind
MISC	it is particularly based on the cross-entropy optimisation algorithm developed by rubinstein citation
OWNX	more precisely, the policy will be modelled by conditional probabilistic law,  i e decisions depending on observations, which are involving memories; typically hidden markov models are used
OWNX	also are implemented a hierachical modelling of the policies by means of hierarchical hidden markov models \\\\ the next section introduces some formalism and gives a quick description of the optimal planning in partially observable universes
MISC	it is proposed a near-optimal planning method, based on the direct approximation of the optimal decision tree
OWNX	the third section introduces the family of hierarchical hidden markov models being in use for approximating the decision trees
OWNX	the fourth section describes the method for optimizing the parameters of the hhmm, in order to approximate the optimal decision tree for the pomdp problem
MISC	a comparison with a reinforcement learning method, the q-learning, is made
OWNX	building on previous work by \emcite{bendavid}, we introduce a novel distance between distributions,  discrepancy distance , that is tailored to adaptation problems with arbitrary loss functions
OWNX	we give rademacher complexity bounds for estimating the discrepancy distance from finite samples for different loss functions
OWNX	using this distance, we derive novel generalization bounds for domain adaptation for a wide family of loss functions
OWNX	we also present a series of novel adaptation bounds for large classes of regularization-based algorithms, including support vector machines and kernel ridge regression based on the empirical discrepancy
OWNX	this motivates our analysis of the problem of minimizing the empirical discrepancy for various loss functions for which we also give novel algorithms
OWNX	we report the results of preliminary experiments that demonstrate the benefits of our discrepancy minimization algorithms for domain adaptation
MISC	in the standard pac model  citation  and other theoretical models of learning, training and test instances are assumed to be drawn from the same distribution
MISC	this is a natural assumption since, when the training and test distributions substantially differ, there can be no hope for generalization
MISC	the problem of domain adaptation arises in a variety of applications in natural language processing  citation , speech processing  citation , computer vision  citation , and many other areas
MISC	quite often, little or no labeled data is available from the  target domain , but labeled data from a  source domain  somewhat similar to the target as well as large amounts of unlabeled data from the target domain are at one's disposal
MISC	the domain adaptation problem then consists of leveraging the source labeled and target unlabeled data to derive a hypothesis performing well on the target domain
MISC	a number of different adaptation techniques have been introduced in the past by the publications just mentioned and other similar work in the context of specific applications
MISC	similar techniques and other more refined ones have been used for training maximum entropy models for language modeling or conditional models  citation
MISC	a theoretical study of domain adaptation was presented by \emcite{nips09}, where the analysis deals with the related but distinct case of adaptation with multiple sources, and where the target is a mixture of the source distributions
MISC	it builds on the work of \emcite{bendavid} and extends it in several ways
OWNX	we introduce a novel distance, the  discrepancy distance , that is tailored to comparing distributions in adaptation
MISC	as already pointed out, a crucial advantage of the  symbol  distance is that it can be estimated from finite samples when the set of regions used has finite vc-dimension
OWNX	we prove that the same holds for the discrepancy distance and in fact give data-dependent versions of that statement with sharper bounds based on the rademacher complexity
OWNX	we give new generalization bounds for domain adaptation and point out some of their benefits by comparing them with previous bounds
OWNX	we further combine these with the properties of the discrepancy distance to derive data-dependent rademacher complexity learning bounds
OWNX	we also present a series of novel results for large classes of regularization-based algorithms, including support vector machines (svms)  citation  and kernel ridge regression (krr)  citation
OWNX	we compare the pointwise loss of the hypothesis returned by these algorithms when trained on a sample drawn from the target domain distribution, versus that of a hypothesis selected by these algorithms when training on a sample drawn from the source distribution
OWNX	we show that the difference of these pointwise losses can be bounded by a term that depends directly on the empirical discrepancy distance of the source and target distributions
MISC	these learning bounds motivate the idea of replacing the empirical source distribution with another distribution with the same support but with the smallest discrepancy with respect to the target empirical distribution, which can be viewed as reweighting the loss on each labeled point
OWNX	we analyze the problem of determining the distribution minimizing the discrepancy in both 0-1 classification and square loss regression
OWNX	we show how the problem can be cast as a linear program (lp) for the 0-1 loss and derive a specific efficient combinatorial algorithm to solve it in dimension one
OWNX	we also give a polynomial-time algorithm for solving this problem in the case of the square loss by proving that it can be cast as a semi-definite program (sdp)
OWNX	finally, we report the results of preliminary experiments showing the benefits of our analysis and discrepancy minimization algorithms
OWNX	in section~, we describe the learning set-up for domain adaptation and introduce the notation and rademacher complexity concepts needed for the presentation of our results
OWNX	section~ introduces the discrepancy distance and analyzes its properties
OWNX	section~ presents our generalization bounds and our theoretical guarantees for regularization-based algorithms
OWNX	section~ describes and analyzes our discrepancy minimization algorithms
OWNX	section~ reports the results of our preliminary experiments
MISC	the tasks are related, which is modeled by imposing that the  symbol --tuple of actions taken by the decision maker needs to satisfy certain constraints
OWNX	we briefly discuss ``tracking'' and ``bandit'' versions of the problem and extend the model in various ways, including non-additive global losses and uncountably infinite sets of tasks
MISC	multi-task learning has recently received considerable attention, see  citation
MISC	in multi-task learning problems, one simultaneously learns several tasks that are related in some sense
MISC	the relationship of the tasks has been modeled in different ways in the literature
MISC	in our setting, a decision maker chooses an action simultaneously for each of  symbol  given tasks, in a repeated manner (to each of these tasks corresponds a game, and we will use interchangeably the concepts of game and task ) the relatedness is accounted for by putting some hard constraints on these simultaneous actions
MISC	as a motivating example, consider a distance-selling company that designs several commercial offers for its numerous customers, and the customers are ordered (say) by age
MISC	the company has to choose whom to send which offer
MISC	basic marketing considerations suggest that offers given to customers with similar age should not be very different, so the company selects a batch of offers that satisfy such a constraint
MISC	additional budget constraint may limit further the set of batches from which the company may select
OWNX	after the offers are sent out, the customers' responses are observed (at least partially) and new offers are selected and sent
MISC	we model such situations by playing many repeated games simultaneously with the restriction that the vector of actions that can be selected at a time needs to belong to a previously given set
MISC	the goal of the decision maker is to minimize the total accumulated regret (across the many games and through time), that is, perform, on the long run, almost as well as the best constant vector of actions satisfying the constraint
MISC	the problem of playing repeatedly several games simultaneously has been considered by  citation  who studies convergence to nash equilibria but does not address the issue of computational feasibility when a large number of games is played
MISC	on-line multi-task learning problems were also studied by  citation  and  citation
OWNX	as the latter reference, we consider minimizing regret simultaneously in parallel, by enforcing however some hard constraints
MISC	in previous models restrictions were only considered on the comparison class, but not on the way the decision maker plays
OWNX	we formulate the problem in the framework of on-line regret minimization, see  citation  for a survey
MISC	the main challenge is to construct a strategy for playing the many games simultaneously with small regret such that the strategy has a manageable computational complexity
OWNX	finally, we also consider cases when there are infinitely many tasks, indexed by real numbers
MISC	in such cases the decision maker chooses a function from a certain restricted class of functions
MISC	besides, the two families of forecasters, as pointed out by  citation , usually have implementation complexities of the same order
MISC	the problem of completing a low-rank matrix from a subset of its entries is often encountered in the analysis of incomplete data sets exhibiting an underlying factor model with applications in collaborative filtering, computer vision and control
MISC	a related problem from both the mathematical and algorithmic point of view is the distance geometry problem of realizing points in a euclidean space from a given subset of their pairwise distances
MISC	rigidity theory answers basic questions regarding the uniqueness of the realization satisfying a given partial set of distances
OWNX	crucial to our analysis is a new matrix, which we call the  completion matrix , that serves as the analogue of the rigidity matrix
MISC	can the missing entries of an incomplete real valued matrix be recovered
MISC	clearly, a matrix can be completed in an infinite number of ways by replacing the missing entries with arbitrary values
OWNX	in order for the completion question to be of any value we must restrict the matrix to belong to a certain class of matrices
MISC	a popular class of matrices are the matrices of limited rank and the problem of completing a low-rank matrix from a subset of its entries has received a great deal of attention lately
MISC	the completion problem comes up naturally in a variety of settings
MISC	one of these is the  netflix  problem  citation , where users submit rankings for only a small subset of movies, and one would like to infer their preference of unrated movies
MISC	the data matrix of all user-ratings may be approximately low-rank because it is believed that only a few factors contribute to an individual's preferences
MISC	the completion problem also arises in computer vision, in the problem of inferring three-dimensional structure from motion  citation , as well as in many other data analysis, machine learning  citation , control  citation  and other problems that are modeled by a factor model
MISC	numerous completion algorithms have been proposed over the years, see eg ,  citation
MISC	many of the algorithms relax the non-convex rank constraint by the convex set of semidefinite positive matrices and solve a convex optimization problem using semidefinite programming (sdp)  citation
MISC	these fascinating recent results do not provide, however, a solution to the more practical case in which the pattern of missing entries is non-random
MISC	prior to running any of the numerous existing completion algorithms such as sdp it is important for the analyst to know if such a completion is indeed unique
AIMX	building on ideas from rigidity theory (see, eg ,  citation ) we propose an efficient randomized algorithm that determines whether or not it is possible to uniquely complete an incomplete matrix to a matrix of specified rank  symbol
OWNX	our proposed algorithm does not attempt to complete the matrix but only determines if a unique completion is possible
OWNX	we introduce a new matrix, which we call  the completion matrix  that serves as the analogue of the rigidity matrix in rigidity theory
OWNX	the rank of the completion matrix determines a property which we call infinitesimal completion
OWNX	as in rigidity theory, we will also make the distinction between  local  completion and  global  completion
OWNX	the analogy between rigidity and completion is quite striking, and we believe that many of the results in rigidity theory can be usefully translated to the completion setup
OWNX	section  contains a glossary of definitions and results in rigidity theory on which our algorithms are based
OWNX	in section  we analyze the low-rank completion problem for the particular case of positive semidefinite gram matrices and present algorithms for testing local and global completion of such matrices
OWNX	in section  the analysis is generalized to the more common completion problem of general low-rank rectangular matrices and corresponding algorithms are provided
OWNX	section  is concerned with the combinatorial characterization of entry patterns that can be either locally completed or globally completed
OWNX	in particular, we present a simple combinatorial characterization for rank-1 matrices and comment on the rank-2 and rank- symbol  ( symbol ) cases
OWNX	in section  we detail the results of extensive numerical simulations in which we tested the performance of our algorithms while verifying the theoretical bounds of  citation  for matrices with random missing patterns
OWNX	finally, section  is a summary and discussion
OWNX	we introduce a new protocol for prediction with expert advice in which each expert evaluates the learner's and his own performance using a loss function that may change over time and may be different from the loss functions used by the other experts
MISC	the learner's goal is to perform better or not much worse than each expert, as evaluated by that expert, for all experts simultaneously
MISC	if the loss functions used by the experts are all proper scoring rules and all mixable, we show that the defensive forecasting algorithm enjoys the same performance guarantee as that attainable by the aggregating algorithm in the standard setting and known to be optimal
MISC	this result is also applied to the case of ``specialist'' (or ``sleeping'') experts
MISC	in this case, the defensive forecasting algorithm reduces to a simple modification of the aggregating algorithm
OWNX	we consider the problem of online sequence prediction
MISC	a process generates outcomes  symbol  step by step
MISC	at each step  symbol , a learner tries to guess the next outcome announcing his prediction  symbol
MISC	then the actual outcome  symbol  is revealed
MISC	the quality of the learner's prediction is measured by a loss function: the learner's loss at step  symbol  is  symbol
MISC	the performance of the learner is compared to the performance of several other predictors called experts
MISC	at each step, each expert gives his prediction  symbol , then the learner produces his own prediction  symbol  (possibly based on the experts' predictions at the last step and the experts' predictions and outcomes at all the previous steps), and the accumulated losses are updated for the learner  and for the experts
MISC	there are many algorithms for the learner in this framework; for a review, see~ citation
MISC	in practical applications of the algorithms for prediction with expert advice, choosing the loss function is often a problem
MISC	the task may have no natural measure of loss, except the vague concept that the closer the prediction to the outcome the better
MISC	thus one can select among several common loss functions, for example, the quadratic loss (reflecting the idea of least squares methods) or the logarithmic loss (which has an information theory background)
MISC	a similar issue arises when experts themselves are prediction algorithms that optimize some losses internally
MISC	then it is unfair to these experts when the learner competes with them according to a ``foreign'' loss function
MISC	the performance of the learner is compared to the performance of each expert according to the loss function linked to that expert
MISC	informally speaking, each expert has to be convinced that the learner performs almost as well as, or better than, that expert himself
OWNX	we generalize some of the known results in the case of mixable loss functions
OWNX	we formulate our results for mixable loss functions only
MISC	however, these results can be easily transferred  to more general settings (non-binary outcomes, arbitrary prediction spaces, countably many experts, second-guessing experts, etc )\ where the methods of~ citation  work
OWNX	we present  multiplicative updates for solving hard  and soft margin support  vector  machines  (svm)  with non-negative  kernels
MISC	they follow as a natural extension of the updates for non-negative matrix factorization
MISC	no additional parameter  setting, such  as choosing learning,   rate   is   required
MISC	support  vector  machines  (svm)  are  now  routinely  used  for  many classification problems  in machine learning~ citation  due to their  ease of use and  ability to generalize
MISC	this can  be formulated as a non-negative  quadratic programming (nqp) problem    and    there   are    efficient    algorithms   to    solve it~ citation
MISC	svm  can be  trained using  variants  of the  gradient descent  method applied   to  the   nqp
MISC	although   these  methods   can   be  quite efficient~ citation , their drawback  is the requirement of setting  the   learning  rate
MISC	subset  selection  methods   are  an alternative      approach     to      solving     the      svm     nqp problem~ citation
MISC	an alternative algorithm for solving  the general nqp problem has been applied   to  svm   in~ citation
MISC	it  does not require any heuristics, such as setting the learning rate or choosing how to split the argument set
MISC	nmf employs multiplicative updates and is  very successful in practice  due to its  independence from the learning rate parameter, low  computational complexity and the ease of implementation
MISC	the requirement  of a non-negative  kernel is  not very  restrictive since their set includes many  popular kernels, such as gaussian, polynomial of  even  degree  etc
MISC	the  new  updates possess  all  of  the  good properties   of  the   nmf  algorithm,   such  as   independence  from hyper-parameters,  low  computational   complexity  and  the  ease  of implementation
OWNX	we also  show how  to solve the  svm problem  with soft margin using the new algorithm
MISC	collaborative filtering systems influence purchase decisions, and hence have become targets of manipulation by unscrupulous vendors
MISC	while the expanding universe of products available via internet commerce provides consumers with valuable options, sifting through the numerous alternatives to identify desirable choices can be challenging
MISC	at the heart of a cf system is an algorithm that predicts whether a given user will like various products based on his past behavior and that of other users
MISC	nearest neighbor (nn) algorithms, for example, have enjoyed wide use in commercial cf systems, including those of amazon, netflix, and youtube  citation
MISC	a prototypical nn algorithm stores each user's history, which may include, for instance, his product ratings and purchase decisions
MISC	a prediction is then generated based on how these so-called neighbors have responded to the product
MISC	this prediction could be, for example, a weighted average of past ratings supplied by neighbors
MISC	because purchase decisions are influenced by cf systems, they have become targets of manipulation by unscrupulous vendors
MISC	for instance, a vendor can create multiple online identities and use each to rate his own product highly and competitors' products poorly
MISC	although this incident may not have been driven by commercial motives, it highlights the vulnerability of cf systems
MISC	the research literature offers further empirical evidence that nn algorithms are susceptible to manipulation  citation
MISC	in order to curb manipulation, one might consider authenticating each user by asking for, say, a credit card number to limit the number of fake identities
MISC	this may be effective in some situations
MISC	however, in web services that do not facilitate financial transactions, such as youtube, requiring authentication would intrude privacy and drive users away
MISC	one might also consider using only customer purchase data, when they are available, as a basis for recommendations because they are likely generated by honest users
MISC	recommendation quality may be improved, however, if higher-volume data such as page views are also properly utilized
OWNX	we find that, while nn algorithms can be quite sensitive to manipulation, cf algorithms that carry out predictions based on a particular class of probabilistic models are surprisingly robust
OWNX	we find that as a user rates an increasing number of products, the average accuracy of predictions made by a linear cf algorithm becomes insensitive to manipulated data
OWNX	to provide some intuition for why our results should hold, we now offer an informal argument
MISC	a robust cf algorithm should learn from its mistakes
MISC	in particular, differences between its predictions and actual ratings should help improve predictions on future ratings
OWNX	a linear cf algorithm generates predictions based on a probability distribution that is a convex combination of two distributions: one that it would learn given only data generated by honest users and one that it would learn given only manipulated data
OWNX	as a user whose ratings we wish to predict provides more ratings, it becomes increasingly clear which of these two distributions better represents his preferences
OWNX	as a result, the weight placed on manipulated data diminishes and distortion vanishes
OWNX	to broaden the scope of our analysis, we will also study cf algorithms that behave like linear cf algorithms asymptotically as the size of the training set grows
OWNX	this class of algorithms, which we refer to as  asymptotically linear , is more flexible in accommodating modeling assumptions that may improve prediction accuracy
OWNX	we will establish that a relaxed version of our distortion bound for linear cf algorithms applies to asymptotically linear cf algorithms
OWNX	we will also show that our distortion bound does not generally hold for nn algorithms
MISC	intuitively, this is because prediction errors do not always improve the selection of neighbors
OWNX	in particular, as a user provides more ratings, manipulated data that contribute to inaccurate predictions of his future ratings may remain in the set of neighbors while data generated by honest users may be eliminated from it
MISC	as a result, distortion of predictions may not decrease
OWNX	we produce a distorted version of this data set by injecting manipulated ratings generated using a manipulation technique studied in prior literature
OWNX	we then compare results from application of three cf algorithms: an nn algorithm, a linear cf algorithm called the kernel density estimation algorithm, and an asymptotically linear cf algorithm called the naive bayes algorithm
OWNX	results demonstrate that while performance of the nn algorithm is highly susceptible to manipulation, those of kernel density estimation and naive bayes algorithms are relatively robust
OWNX	in particular, the latter two experience distortion lower than the theoretical bound we provide, whereas the distortion for the former exceeds it by far
MISC	as an example, consider an algorithm that fixes predictions for all ratings to be a constant, without regard to the training data
MISC	this algorithm is uninfluenced by manipulation but is likely to yield poor predictions, and is therefore not useful
OWNX	in our experiments, the accuracy demonstrated by the three algorithms all seems reasonable
OWNX	in the next section, we discuss some related work
OWNX	in section , we formulate a simplified model that serves as a context for studying alternative cf algorithms
OWNX	we then establish results concerning the manipulation robustness of nn, linear, and asymptotically linear cf algorithms in section
OWNX	in section , we present our empirical study
OWNX	we make some closing remarks in a final section
MISC	collecting large labeled data sets is a laborious and expensive task, whose scaling up requires division of the labeling workload between many teachers
MISC	when the number of classes is large, miscorrespondences between the labels given by the different teachers are likely to occur, which, in the extreme case, may reach total inconsistency
AIMX	in this study we describe how globally consistent labels can be obtained, despite the absence of teacher coordination, and discuss the possible efficiency of this process in terms of human labor
OWNX	we define a notion of label efficiency, measuring the ratio between the number of globally consistent labels obtained and the number of labels provided by distributed teachers
OWNX	we show that the efficiency depends critically on the ratio  symbol  between the number of data instances seen by a single teacher, and the number of classes
OWNX	we suggest several algorithms for the distributed labeling problem, and analyze their efficiency as a function of  symbol
OWNX	in addition, we provide an upper bound on label efficiency for the case of completely uncoordinated teachers, and show that efficiency approaches  symbol  as the ratio between the number of labels each teacher provides and the number of classes drops (i e symbol )
MISC	as applications of machine learning mature, larger training sets are required both in terms of the number of training instances and the number of classes considered
MISC	in recent years we have witnessed this trend for example in vision related tasks such as object class recognition or detection  citation
MISC	specifically for object class recognition, current data sets such as the caltech-256  citation  include tens of thousands of images from hundreds of classes
MISC	collecting consistent data sets of this size is an intensive and expensive task
MISC	for example, in the label-me system  citation  the labels are contributed by dozens of researchers, while in the esp game  citation  labels are supplied by thousands of uncoordinated players
OWNX	as we turn toward distributed labeling, several practical considerations emerge which may disrupt the data integrity
MISC	in general, while it is reasonable to believe that a single teacher is relatively self-consistent (though not completely error-free), this is not the case with multiple uncoordinated teachers
MISC	different teachers may have differences in their labeling systems due to several causes
MISC	first, different teachers may use different words to describe the same item class
MISC	for example, one teacher may use the word ``truck'' while the other uses ``lorry'' to describe the same class
MISC	conversely, the same word may be used by two teachers to describe two totally different classes, hence one teacher may use ``greyhound'' to describe the breed of dog while the other uses it to describe the c-2 navy aircraft
MISC	similar problems occur when different teachers label the data with different abstraction levels, so one generalizes over all dogs, while the other discriminates between a poodle, a labrador and etc
MISC	finally, teachers often do not agree on the exact demarcation of concepts, so a chair carved in stone may be labeled as a ``chair'' by one teacher, while the other describes it as ``a rock''
MISC	all these phenomena become increasingly pronounced as the number of classes is increased, thus their neglect essentially leads to a severe decrease in label purity and consequently in learning performance
AIMX	in this paper we study the cost of obtaining globally consistent labels, while focusing on a specific distributed labeling scenario, in which only some of the difficulties described above are present
MISC	consider for example a security system for which we have to label a large set of face images, including thousands of different people
MISC	since teachers are not familiar with the persons to be labeled, the names they give to classes are entirely un-coordinated
MISC	the case of a partial consistency is exemplified in distributed labeling of flower images: the layman can easily distinguish between many different kinds of flowers but can name only a few
MISC	consider for example, the task of unifying images labeled in a site like flickr%  into a meaningful large training data set
MISC	in large systems, it is important for agents to learn to act effectively, but sophisticated multi-agent learning algorithms generally do not scale
MISC	an alternative approach is to find restricted classes of games where simple, efficient algorithms converge
MISC	it is shown that stage learning efficiently converges to nash equilibria in large anonymous games if best-reply dynamics converge
MISC	two features are identified that improve convergence
MISC	first, rather than making learning more difficult, more agents are actually beneficial in many settings
MISC	designers of distributed systems are frequently unable to determine how an agent in the system should behave, because optimal behavior depends on the user's preferences and the actions of others
MISC	a natural approach is to have agents use a learning algorithm
MISC	many multiagent learning algorithms have been proposed including simple strategy update procedures such as  fictitious play ~ citation , multiagent versions of  q-learning ~ citation , and  no-regret algorithms ~ citation
MISC	in a distributed system, each agent has a limited view of the actions of other agents
MISC	algorithms that require knowing, for example, the strategy chosen by every agent cannot be implemented
MISC	furthermore, the size of distributed systems requires fast convergence
MISC	users may use the system for short periods of time and conditions in the system change over time, so a practical algorithm for a system with thousands or millions of users needs to have a convergence rate that is sublinear in the number of agents
MISC	existing algorithms tend to provide performance guarantees that are polynomial or even exponential
MISC	even if no agent changes his strategy, there can still be noise in agent payoffs
MISC	for example, a gossip protocol will match different agents from round to round; congestion in the underlying network may effect message delays between agents
MISC	while finding an algorithm that satisfies these requirements for arbitrary games may be difficult, distributed systems have characteristics that make the problem easier
MISC	having more agents may seem to make learning harder---after all, there are more possible interactions
MISC	however, it has the advantage that the  outcome of an action typically depends only weakly on what other agents do
MISC	second, distributed systems are often  anonymous ~ citation ; it does not matter  who  does something, but rather  how many  agents do it
MISC	for example, when there is congestion on a link, the experience of a single agent does not depend on who is sending the packets, but on how many are being sent
MISC	finally, and perhaps most importantly, in a distributed system the system designer controls the game agents are playing
MISC	''   such games should  be ``well behaved,'' since it would be strange to design a  system where an agent's decisions can influence other agents in pathological ways
MISC	in this algorithm, agents divide the rounds of the game into a series of stages
MISC	in each stage, the agent uses a fixed strategy except that he occasionally explores
OWNX	we prove that, under appropriate conditions, a large system of stage learners will follow (approximate) best-reply dynamics despite errors and exploration
OWNX	for games where best-reply dynamics converge, our theorem guarantees that learners will play an approximate nash equilibrium
OWNX	in contrast to previous results where the convergence guarantee scales poorly with the number of agents, our theorem guarantees convergence in a finite amount of time with an infinite number of agents
MISC	while the assumption that best-reply dynamics converge is a strong one, many interesting games converge under best-reply dynamics, including dominance solvable games and games with monotone best replies
MISC	marden et al ~ citation  have observed that convergence of best-reply dynamics is often a property of games that humans design
MISC	moreover, convergence of best-reply dynamics is a weaker assumption than a common assumption made in the mechanism design literature, that the games of interest have dominant strategies (each agent has a strategy that is optimal no matter what other agents do)
OWNX	furthermore, we identify two factors that determine the rate and quality of convergence
MISC	one is the number of agents: having more agents makes the noise in the systen more consistent so agents can learn using fewer observations
MISC	the other is giving agents statistical information about the behavior of other agents; this can speed convergence by an order of magnitude
MISC	indeed, even noisy statistical information about agent behavior, which should be relatively easy to obtain and disseminate,  can significantly improve performance
OWNX	we study the problem of decision-theoretic online learning (dtol)
MISC	previous algorithms for learning in this framework have a tunable learning rate parameter, and a barrier to using online-learning in practical applications is that it is not understood how to set this parameter optimally, particularly when the number of actions is large
OWNX	we introduce a new notion of regret, which is more natural for applications with a large number of actions
OWNX	we show that our algorithm achieves good performance with respect to this new notion of regret; in addition, it also achieves performance close to that of the best bounds achieved by previous algorithms with optimally-tuned parameters, according to previous notions of regret
MISC	dtol is a variant of the problem of prediction with expert advice~ citation
MISC	in this problem, a learner must assign probabilities to a fixed set of actions in a sequence of rounds
MISC	the  regret  (of the learner) to an action is the difference between the learner's cumulative loss and the cumulative loss of that action
MISC	dtol is a general framework that captures many learning problems of interest
MISC	for example, consider tracking the hidden state of an object in a continuous state space from noisy observations~ citation
OWNX	to look at tracking in a dtol framework, we set each action to be a path (sequence of states) over the state space
MISC	the most popular solution to the dtol problem is the hedge algorithm~ citation
MISC	in hedge, each action is assigned a probability, which depends on the cumulative loss of this action and a parameter  symbol , also called the  learning rate
MISC	by appropriately setting the learning rate as a function of the iteration~ citation  and the number of actions, hedge can achieve a regret upper-bounded by  symbol , for each iteration  symbol , where  symbol  is the number of actions
MISC	this bound on the regret is optimal as there is a  symbol  lower-bound~ citation
MISC	a major barrier to using online-learning for practical problems is that when  symbol  is large, it is not understood how to set the learning rate  symbol
MISC	citation  suggest setting  symbol  as a fixed function of the number of actions  symbol
MISC	one way to address this is by simultaneously running multiple copies of hedge with multiple values of the learning rate, and choosing the output of the copy that performs the best in an online way
OWNX	our algorithm is called normalhedge
MISC	a second issue with using online-learning in problems such as tracking,  where  symbol  is very large, is that the regret to the  best action  is not an effective measure of performance
MISC	for problems such as tracking, one expects to have a lot of actions that are close to the action with the lowest loss
MISC	as these actions also have low loss, measuring performance with respect to a small group of actions that perform well is extremely reasonable -- see, for example, figure~
AIMX	in this paper, we address this issue by introducing a new notion of regret, which is more natural for practical applications
OWNX	notice that in our regret bound, the term involving  symbol  has no dependence on  symbol
MISC	normalhedge works by assigning each action  symbol  a potential; actions which have lower cumulative loss than the algorithm are assigned a potential  symbol , where  symbol  is the regret of action  symbol  and  symbol  is an adaptive scale parameter, which is adjusted from one round to the next, depending on the loss-sequences
MISC	actions which have higher cumulative loss than the algorithm are assigned potential  symbol
MISC	the weight assigned to an action in each round is then  proportional to the derivative of its potential
OWNX	our proof techniques are also different from previous potential-based methods
MISC	another useful property of normalhedge, which hedge does not possess, is that it assigns zero weight to any action whose cumulative loss is larger than the cumulative loss of the algorithm itself
MISC	in other words, non-zero weights are assigned only to actions which perform better than the algorithm
MISC	these bounds can be sharper than the bounds with respect to  symbol
OWNX	in section 2, we provide normalhedge
OWNX	in section 4, we discuss related work
OWNX	in section 5, we present some outlines of the proof
OWNX	we study the tracking problem, namely, estimating the hidden state of an object over time, from unreliable and noisy measurements
OWNX	the standard framework for the tracking problem is the generative framework, which is the basis of solutions such as the bayesian algorithm and its approximation, the particle filters
MISC	however, the problem with these solutions is that they are very sensitive to model mismatches
OWNX	we provide an efficient tracking algorithm for this framework
OWNX	we provide experimental results comparing our algorithm to the bayesian algorithm on simulated data
OWNX	our experiments show that when there are slight model mismatches, our algorithm vastly outperforms the bayesian algorithm
MISC	in tracking, we are given noisy measurements over time, and the problem is to estimate the hidden state of an object
MISC	the challenge is to do this reliably, by combining measurements from multiple time steps and prior knowledge about the state dynamics, and the goal of tracking is to produce estimates that are as close to the true states as possible
MISC	the most popular solutions to the tracking problem are the kalman filter~ citation , the particle filter~ citation , and their numerous extensions and variations ( eg ~ citation ), which are  based on a generative framework for the tracking problem
OWNX	in the generative approach, we think of the state  symbol  and measurements  symbol  as random variables
OWNX	we represent our knowledge regarding the dynamics of the states using the transition process  symbol  and our knowledge regarding the (noisy) relationship between the states and the observations by the measurement process  symbol
MISC	this is done by calculating the likelihood of each state sequence and then using as the estimate either the sequence with the highest posterior probability (maximum a posteriori, or map) or the expected value of the state with respect to the posterior distribution (the bayesian algorithm)
OWNX	in practice, one uses particle filters, which are an approximation to the bayesian algorithm
MISC	the problem with the generative framework is that in practice, it is very difficult to precisely determine the distributions of the measurements
OWNX	we emphasize that this is done regardless of how the observations are generated
MISC	the tracking algorithm selects its own \explanatory\ path by taking a weighted average of the best \explanatory\ paths according the past observations
OWNX	the theoretical guarantee we provide is that the loss of the \explanatory\ path generated in this online way by the tracking algorithm is close to that of the \explanatory\ path with the minimum \changeto{loss, where}{such loss; here,} the loss is measured according to the loss function supplied to the algorithm
OWNX	our next contribution is to provide an online-learning-based algorithm for tracking in the \explanatory\ framework
MISC	when supplied with a bounded loss function, it is guaranteed to produce a path with loss close to that of the path with the minimum loss, from a set of candidate paths
OWNX	as it is inefficient to directly apply \nhedge\ to tracking, we derive a sequential \changeto{monte-carlo-based}{monte carlo} approximation to \nhedge, and we show that this approximation is efficient
OWNX	to demonstrate the robustness of our tracking algorithm, we perform simulations on a simple one-dimensional tracking problem
OWNX	we instantiate our algorithm with a simple clipping loss function
OWNX	our simulations show that our algorithm consistently outperforms the bayesian algorithm, under high measurement noise, and a wide range of levels of model mismatch
OWNX	we note that bayesian algorithm can also be interpreted in the \explanatory\ framework
MISC	in particular, if the loss of a path is the negative log-likelihood (the log-loss) under some measurement model, then, the bayesian algorithm can be shown to produce a path with log-loss close to that of the path with the minimum log-loss
AIMX	one may be tempted to think that our tracking solution follows the same approach; however, the point of our paper is that one can use loss functions that are different from log-loss, and in particular, we show a scenario \changeto{where}{in which} using other loss functions produces better tracking performance than the bayesian algorithm (or its approximations)
OWNX	in section 2, we explain in detail our explanatory model for tracking
OWNX	in section 3, we present \changeto{normalhedge }{normalhedge, on which our tracking algorithm is based}
OWNX	in section 4, we provide our \changeto{actual tracking algorithm}{tracking algorithm} \changeto{section 5 presents some experiments that compare our algorithm with the bayesian algorithm on simulated data }{section 5 presents the experimental comparison of our algorithm with the bayesian algorithm } \changeto{finally, in section 6, we report on our experiments with face-tracking }{finally, we discuss related work in section 6 }  the detailed bounds and proofs for normalhedge are provided in the supplementary material
MISC	this question may be considered a refinement of the problem of sequence prediction in its most general formulation: for a given  class of probability measures, does there exist a measure which predicts all of the measures in the class
MISC	let a sequence  symbol ,  symbol  of letters from some finite alphabet  symbol  be generated by some probability measure  symbol
OWNX	having observed the first  symbol  letters  symbol  we want to predict what is the probability of the next letter being  symbol , for each  symbol
MISC	this task is motivated by numerous applications --- from weather forecasting and stock market prediction to data compression
OWNX	if the measure  symbol  is known completely then the best forecasts one can make for the  symbol st  outcome of a sequence  symbol  is  symbol -conditional probabilities of   symbol  given  symbol
MISC	on the other hand, it is immediately apparent that if nothing is known about the distribution  symbol  generating the sequence then no prediction is possible, since for any predictor there is a measure on which it errs (gives inadequate probability forecasts) on every step
MISC	thus one has to restrict the attention to some class of measures
MISC	he suggested to assume that the probability that the sun rises is the same every day and the trials are independent of each other
MISC	thus laplace considered the task of sequence prediction when the true generating measure belongs to the family of bernoulli  iid  \ measures  with binary alphabet  symbol
MISC	the predicting measure suggested by laplace was  symbol  where  symbol  is the number of 1s in  symbol
MISC	the conditional probabilities of laplace's measure  symbol  converge to the true conditional probabilities  symbol -almost surely under any bernoulli  iid  measure  symbol
MISC	this approach generalizes to the problem of predicting any finite-memory (e g \ markovian) measure
MISC	moreover, in  citation  a measure  symbol  was constructed for predicting an arbitrary stationary measure
MISC	the conditional probabilities of  symbol  converge to the true ones  on average , where average is taken over time steps (that is, in cesaro sense),  symbol -almost surely for any stationary measure  symbol
MISC	however, as it was shown in the same work, there is no measure for which conditional probabilities converge to the true ones  symbol -a s \ for every stationary  symbol
OWNX	thus we can see that already for the problem of predicting outcomes of a stationary measure two criteria of prediction arise: prediction in the average (or in cesaro sense) and prediction on each step, and the solution exists only for the former problem
MISC	a different assumption one can make is that the measure  symbol  generating the sequence is computable
MISC	solomonoff  citation  suggested a measure  symbol  for predicting any computable probability measure
MISC	the key observation here is that the class of all computable probability measures is countable; let us denote it by  symbol
MISC	a bayesian predictor  symbol  for a countable class of measures  symbol   is constructed as follows:  symbol  for any measurable set a, where the weights  symbol  are positive  and sum to one
MISC	the best predictor for a measure  symbol  is the measure  symbol  itself
MISC	it was shown by solomonoff  citation  that  symbol -conditional probabilities converge to  symbol -conditional probabilities almost surely for any computable measure  symbol
MISC	in fact this is a special case of a more general (though without convergence rate) result of blackwell and dubins  citation  which states that if a measure  symbol  is absolutely continuous with respect to a measure  symbol  then  symbol  converges to  symbol  in total variation  symbol -almost surely
MISC	convergence in total variation means prediction in a very strong sense~--- convergence of conditional probabilities of arbitrary events (not just the next outcome), or prediction with arbitrary fast growing horizon
MISC	thus the problem of sequence prediction for certain  classes of measures (such as the class of all stationary measures or the class of all computable measures) was often addressed in the literature
MISC	although the mentioned classes of measures are sufficiently interesting, it is often hard to decide in applications with which assumptions does a problem at hand comply; not to mention such practical issues as that a predicting measure for all computable measures is necessarily non-computable itself
MISC	moreover, to be able to generalize the solutions of the sequence prediction problem to such problems as active learning, where outcomes of a sequence may depend on actions of the predictor, one has to understand better under which conditions  the problem of sequence prediction is solvable
MISC	in particular, in active learning, the stationarity assumption does not seem to be applicable (since the predictions are non-stationary), although, say, the markov assumption is often applicable and is extensively studied
MISC	in  citation  a question of whether, given a class of measures  symbol  and a prior (``meta''-measure)  symbol  over this class of measures, the conditional probabilities of a bayesian mixture of the class  symbol  w r t
MISC	this question can be considered solved, since the authors provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the measure given by the mixture of the class  symbol  w r t
MISC	symbol  for each  symbol ), and moreover, for any measure  symbol  some constants  symbol  can be found that satisfy ()
MISC	for example, if  symbol  is bernoulli  iid  \ measure with parameter  symbol  and  symbol  is any other measure, then () is (trivially) satisfied with  symbol
OWNX	thus we know that if  symbol  then  symbol  predicts  symbol  in a very strong sense, whereas exponentially decreasing  symbol  are not enough for prediction
OWNX	perhaps somewhat surprisingly, we will show that dominance with any subexponentially decreasing coefficients is sufficient for prediction, in a weak sense of convergence of expected averages
MISC	dominance with any polynomially decreasing coefficients, and also with coefficients decreasing (for example) as  symbol , is sufficient for (almost sure) prediction on average (i e \ in cesaro sense)
MISC	thus the situation is similar to that for predicting any stationary measure: prediction is possible in the average but not on every step
MISC	note also that for laplace's measure  symbol  it can be shown that  symbol  dominates any  iid  \ measure  symbol  with linearly decreasing coefficients  symbol ; a generalization of  symbol  for predicting all measures with memory  symbol  (for a given  symbol ) dominates them with polynomially  decreasing coefficients
MISC	another way to look for generalizations  is as follows
MISC	the bayes mixture  symbol , being a sum of countably many measures (predictors), possesses some of their predicting properties
MISC	in general, which predictive properties are preserved under summation
OWNX	in particular, if we have two predictors  symbol  and  symbol  for two classes of measures, we are interested in the question whether  symbol  is a predictor for the union of the two classes
OWNX	an answer to this question would improve our understanding of how far a class of measures for which a predicting measure exists can be extended without losing this property \paranodot{{thus,} the second question} we consider is the following: suppose that a measure  symbol  predicts  symbol  (in some weak sense), and let  symbol  be some other measure (e g \ a predictor for a different class of measures)
MISC	does the measure  symbol  still predict  symbol
OWNX	that is, we ask to which prediction quality criteria does the idea of taking a bayesian sum generalize
MISC	absolute continuity is preserved under summation along with it's (strong) prediction ability
OWNX	here we find that several stronger notions of prediction are not preserved under summation
MISC	is dominance with decreasing coefficients sufficient for prediction in some sense, under some  conditions on the coefficients
MISC	and, if a measure  symbol  predicts a measure  symbol  in some sense, does the measure  symbol  also predict  symbol  in the same sense, where  symbol  is an arbitrary measure
OWNX	considering different criteria of prediction (a s \ convergence of conditional probabilities, a s \ convergence of averages, etc ) in the above two questions we obtain not two but many different questions, some of which we answer in the positive and some in the negative,   yet some are left open
OWNX	section~ introduces necessary notation and measures of divergence of probability measures
OWNX	in section~ we discuss some interesting special cases of the questions considered, and also some related problems
OWNX	a  symbol -adic modification of the split-lbg classification method is presented in which first clusterings and then cluster centers  are computed which locally minimise an energy function
MISC	the methods are applied to the construction of  symbol -adic classifiers in the context of learning
MISC	the field  symbol  of   symbol -adic numbers is of interest  in hierarchical classification  because of its inherent hierarchical structure  citation
MISC	a great amount of work deals with finding  symbol -adic data representation (e g \  citation )
MISC	this was applied in  citation  to the special case of data consisting in words over a given alphabet and where proximity of words is defined by the length of the common initial part
MISC	however, the question of finding optimal clusterings of  symbol -adic data was not raised
MISC	this process is repeated until the desired class number is attained
MISC	the  a posteriori  choice of centers turns out useful for  constructing % efficient classifiers
OWNX	after introducing notations in section , we briefly describe the classical split-lbg method in section
OWNX	section  reformulates the minimisation task of split-lbg in  the  symbol -adic setting, and describes the corresponding algorithms
MISC	such exploration is impossible in environments with the unlimited number of states
MISC	in reinforcement learning citation  an agent collects rewards in an environment
MISC	the environment is not known in advance
MISC	the agent has to explore it to learn where to go
MISC	a reward could be received when taking an action in a state
MISC	there are many existing exploration techniques citation  that are optimistic in the face of uncertainty
MISC	their optimism assumes that a greater reward will be obtained when taking an unknown action
MISC	the problem is how to do exploration in environments with the unlimited number of states
MISC	in these environments, it is not possible to try every action in every possible state
OWNX	i describe how to use this kind of exploration in section
OWNX	my experiments in section  demonstrate how simulated exploration reduced the needed amount of real exploration
MISC	many works touched related problems
OWNX	they inspired me and i discuss them in section
OWNX	in this work, we first show that feature selection methods other than boosting can also be used for training an efficient object detector
OWNX	in particular, we introduce greedy sparse linear discriminant analysis (gslda)  citation  for its conceptual simplicity and  computational efficiency; and slightly better detection performance is achieved compared with  citation
OWNX	moreover, we propose a new technique, termed boosted greedy sparse linear discriminant analysis (bgslda), to efficiently train a detection cascade
OWNX	experiments in the domain of highly skewed data distributions, \eg, face detection, demonstrates that classifiers trained with the proposed bgslda outperforms adaboost and its variants
OWNX	this finding provides a significant opportunity to argue that adaboost and similar approaches are not the only methods that can achieve high classification results for high dimensional data in  object detection
MISC	various detectors have been proposed in the literature  citation
OWNX	object detection is challenging due to the variations of the visual appearances, poses and illumination conditions
OWNX	furthermore, object detection is a  highly-imbalanced   classification task
MISC	a typical natural image contains many more negative background patterns than object patterns
MISC	the number of background patterns can be  symbol  times larger than the number of object patterns
OWNX	that means, if one wants to achieve a high detection rate, together with a low false detection rate, one needs a specific classifier
MISC	the cascade classifier takes this imbalanced distribution into consideration  citation
MISC	because of the huge success of viola and jones' real-time adaboost based face detector  citation , a lot of incremental work has been proposed
MISC	most of them have focused on improving the underlying boosting method or accelerating the training process
MISC	for example, asymboost was introduced in  citation  to alleviate the limitation of adaboost in the context of highly skewed example distribution
OWNX	li  citation  proposed floatboost for a better detection accuracy by introducing a backward feature elimination step into the adaboost training procedure
MISC	wu  citation  used forward feature selection for fast training by ignoring the re-weighting scheme in adaboost
MISC	klboost was proposed in  citation  to train a strong classifier
OWNX	therefore in the detection phase, it is not as efficient as haar-like features
MISC	notice that in klboost, the classifier design is separated from feature selection
OWNX	in this work (part of which was published in preliminary form in  citation ),  we propose an improved learning algorithm for face detection, dubbed boosted greedy sparse linear discriminant analysis (bgslda)
MISC	the cascade framework allows most non-face patches to be rejected quickly before reaching the final node, resulting in fast performance
MISC	this way, most non-face patches are rejected by these early nodes
OWNX	cascade detectors lead to very fast detection speed and high detection rates
OWNX	cascade classifiers have also been used in the context of support vector machines (svms) for faster face detection  citation
MISC	in  citation , soft-cascade is developed to  reduce the training and design complexity
MISC	the idea was further developed in  citation
OWNX	we have followed viola and jones' original cascade classifiers in this work
MISC	one issue that contributes to the efficacy of the system comes from the use of adaboost algorithm for training  cascade nodes
MISC	adaboost is a forward stage-wise additive modeling with the weighted exponential loss function
OWNX	the algorithm combines an ensemble of weak classifiers to produce a final strong classifier with high classification accuracy
MISC	adaboost chooses a small subset of weak classifiers and assign them with proper coefficients
OWNX	as a result, the coefficients of selected weak classifiers are updated repetitively during the learning process according to this criterion
OWNX	given the selected features, wu then build an optimal linear classifier for the node learning goal using lac or lda
MISC	note that similar techniques have also been applied in neural network
MISC	in  citation , a nonlinear adaptive feed-forward layered network with linear output units has been introduced
OWNX	as our experiments show, in terms of feature selection,  the proposed bgslda methods is superior than adaboost and asymboost   for object detection }     the key contributions of this work are as follows
OWNX	we introduce gslda  as an alternative approach for training face detectors
OWNX	we propose a new algorithm, bgslda, which combines the sample re-weighting schemes typically used in boosting into gslda
OWNX	experiments show that bgslda can achieve better detection performances
OWNX	we show that feature selection and classifier training techniques can have different objective functions (in other words, the two processes can be separated) in the context of training a visual detector
MISC	this offers more flexibility and even better performance
MISC	previous boosting based approaches select features and train a classifier simultaneously
OWNX	our results confirm that it is beneficial to consider the highly skewed data distribution when training a detector
MISC	hence it is better than standard adaboost's exponential loss for training an object detector
OWNX	we then discuss how lda incorporates imbalanced data information when training a classifier in section~
MISC	detecting outliers which are grossly different from or inconsistent with the remaining dataset is a major challenge in real-world kdd applications
OWNX	we define a novel  local distance-based outlier factor  (ldof) to measure the {outlier-ness} of objects in scattered datasets which addresses these issues
MISC	ldof uses the relative location of an object to its neighbours to determine the degree to which the object deviates from its neighbourhood
MISC	properties of ldof are theoretically analysed including ldof's lower bound and its false-detection probability, as well as parameter settings
OWNX	compared to conventional approaches (such as top- symbol  knn and top- symbol  lof), our method top- symbol  ldof is more effective at detecting outliers in scattered data
MISC	it is also easier to set parameters, since its performance is relatively stable over a large range of parameter values, as illustrated by experimental results on both real-world and synthetic datasets
MISC	it is concerned with discovering the exceptional behavior of certain objects~ citation
MISC	however, these methods are often unsuitable in real-world applications due to a number of reasons
MISC	firstly, real-world data usually have a scattered distribution, where objects are loosely distributed in the domain feature space
MISC	that is, from a `local' point of view, these objects cannot represent explicit patterns (e g clusters) to indicate normal data `behavior'
MISC	only the objects which do not belong to any other object groups are genuine outliers
MISC	unfortunately, existing outlier definitions depend on the assumption that most objects are crowded in a few main clusters
OWNX	secondly, it is difficult in current outlier detection approaches to set accurate parameters for real-world datasets
MISC	most outlier algorithms must be tuned through {trial-and-error}~ citation
OWNX	therefore, the detection result will be uncontrollable if parameters are not properly chosen
OWNX	distance-based, top- symbol  { symbol -nearest} neighbour distance~ citation  is a typical top- symbol  style outlier detection approach
MISC	in {top- symbol  knn} outlier, the distance from an object to its  symbol  nearest neighbour (denoted as { symbol -distance} for short) indicates {outlier-ness} of the object
MISC	intuitively, the larger the { symbol -distance} is, the higher {outlier-ness} the object has {top- symbol  knn} outlier regards the  symbol  objects with the highest values of { symbol -distance} as outliers~ citation
MISC	a {density-based} outlier, local outlier factor (lof)~ citation , was proposed in the same year as top- symbol  knn
MISC	in lof, an outlier factor is assigned for each object w r t its surrounding neighbourhood
OWNX	the outlier factor depends on how the data object is closely packed in its locally reachable neighbourhood~ citation
MISC	since lof uses a threshold to differentiate outliers from normal objects~ citation , the same problem of parameter setting arises
MISC	in recent real-world applications, researchers have found it more reliable to use lof in a top- symbol  manner~ citation , i e \ only objects with the highest lof values will be considered outliers
MISC	besides top- symbol  knn and top- symbol  lof, researchers have proposed other methods to deal with real-world data, such as the {connectivity-based} (cof)~ citation , and resolution {cluster-based} ({rb-outlier})~ citation
MISC	ldof uses the relative distance from an object to its neighbours to measure how much objects deviate from their scattered neighbourhood
MISC	the higher the violation degree an object has, the more likely the object is an outlier
OWNX	in addition, we theoretically analyse the properties of ldof, including its lower bound and false-detection probability, and provide guidelines for choosing a suitable neighbourhood size
OWNX	in order to simplify parameter setting in real-world applications, the top- symbol  technique is employed in our approach
OWNX	the experimental results illustrate that our proposed top- symbol  ldof represents a significant improvement on outlier detection capability for scattered datasets
OWNX	in section~, we formally introduce the outlier definition of our approach, and mathematically analyse properties of our {outlier-ness} factor in section~
OWNX	experiments are reported in section~, which show the superiority of our method to previous approaches, at least on the considered datasets
OWNX	finally, conclusions are presented in section~
MISC	classically sensor management problems can be well formalized as partially-observed markov decision processes (pompd)
MISC	the learned policy can then be used to manage the sensor(s)
OWNX	in order to approximate the gradient in a stochastic context, we introduce a new method to approximate the gradient, based on infinitesimal approximation (ipa)
MISC	years after years the complexity and the performances of many sensors have increased leading to more and more complex sensor(s)-based systems which supply the decision centers with an increasing amount of data
MISC	the number, the types and the agility of sensors along with the increased quality of data far outstrip the ability of a human to manage them: it is often difficult to compare how much information can be gained by way of a given management scheme  citation
MISC	it results from this the necessity to derive unmanned sensing platforms that have the capacity to adapt to their environment  citation
MISC	this problem is often refered as the  sensor(s) management problem
MISC	in more simple situations, the operational context may lead to works on sensor(s) management like in the  radar - infrared sensor  case  citation
MISC	a general definition of this problem could then be : sensor management is the effective use of available sensing and database capabilities to meet the mission goals
MISC	many applications deal with military applications,a classical one being to detect, to track and tp identify smart targets (a smart target can change its way of moving or its way of sensing when it detects it is under analysis) with several sensors
MISC	the increasing complexity of the targets to be detected, tracked and identified, makes the management even more difficult and led to the development of researches on the definition of an optimal sensor management scheme in which the targets and the sensors are treated altogether in a complex dynamic system  citation
MISC	sensor management has become very popular this last years and many approaches can be found in the litterature
OWNX	in  citation  and  citation  the authors use a the modelling of the detection process of an electronically scanned array (esa) radar to propose management scheme during the detection step
MISC	in  citation  an information-based approach is use to manage a set of sensors
MISC	from a theorical point of view the sensor management can be modelled as a partially observable markov decision process (pomdp)  citation
MISC	whatever the underlying application, the sensor management problem consists in choosing at each time  symbol  an action  symbol  within the set  symbol  of available actions
MISC	the choice of  symbol  is generally based on the density state vector  symbol  describing the environment of the system and variables of the system itself
MISC	it is generally assumed that the state or at least a part of this state is markovian
OWNX	this estimation process is often derived within a bayesian framework where we use state-dynamics and observation models such as:   symbol }   symbol }  where  symbol ,  symbol ,  symbol  and  symbol  respectively stands for the state noise, the measurements noise, the state-dynamics and the measurement function
MISC	symbol  and  symbol  are generally time varying functions
MISC	the control problem consists in finding the scheduling policy  symbol  i e select  symbol  given the past and the possible futures
MISC	however, this control problem may have a theorical solution, it is generally untractable in practice
MISC	however few works propose optimal solution in the frame of pomdps like  citation
MISC	beside, several works have been carried out to find sub-optimal policies like for instance myopic policies
MISC	reinforcement learning and q-learning have also been used to propose a solution ( citation )
MISC	once the optimal parameter has been found it is used to manage the sensor(s)
AIMX	the frame of this work being the detection and localization of targets, we show in the last part of this paper how it may be applied the the management of an esa radar
OWNX	in the section  we derive the algorithm to learn the parameter of the policy
OWNX	in section  we show how this method may be used for the tasking of an esa radar
OWNX	finally section  exhibits firts simulations results
MISC	given a random binary sequence  symbol  of random variables,  symbol   symbol , for instance, one that is generated by a markov source of order  symbol  (each state represented by  symbol  bits)
MISC	let  symbol  be the probability of  symbol  and assume it is constant with respect to  symbol  (due to stationarity)
MISC	test the learner's performance by giving it a sequence  symbol  (generated by the source) and check its predictions on every bit of  symbol  an error occurs at time  symbol  if the  prediction  symbol  differs from the true bit value  symbol
MISC	denote by  symbol  the sequence of errors where the error bit  symbol  at time  symbol  equals  symbol  or  symbol  according to whether the event of an error occurs or not, respectively
MISC	from basic theory on finite markov chains, since the matrix  symbol  is stochastic (i e , the sum of the elements in any row equals  symbol ) then  symbol  has a stationary joint probability distribution  symbol *} which is not necessarily unique
OWNX	to keep the notation simple we use  symbol  to denote also any marginal distribution derived from the stationary joint distribution
MISC	for instance,  symbol
MISC	henceforth, all random binary sequences are assumed to be drawn according to this probability distribution  symbol
MISC	thus for any  symbol  and  symbol  satisfying  symbol  the probability of a string  symbol  can be expressed as  symbol } let us denote by  symbol } the stationary probability of the event  symbol  at time  symbol
OWNX	data generation : we henceforth assume that the source reached stationarity and produces the data sequence  symbol  with respect to  symbol
MISC	consider the learner's model  symbol
MISC	its set of parameters are the true (unknown) probability values of transitions between states in  symbol  where the probability values are assigned according to the source distribution  symbol
OWNX	we denote them by  symbol  for instance, suppose  symbol  and  symbol  and consider two states  symbol  and  symbol
MISC	the corresponding transition probability is  symbol  based on  symbol  the learner estimates  symbol  by  symbol  where for a state  symbol ,  symbol  denotes the number of times that  symbol  appears in  symbol  and  symbol  denotes the number of times there is a transition from state  symbol  to  symbol  in  symbol
MISC	for instance, if  symbol ,  symbol  and  symbol  then  symbol
MISC	thus  symbol  are the frequency of state-transitions in  symbol
MISC	note that  symbol ,  symbol , are dependent random variables since the markov chain may visit each state a random number of times and they must satisfy  symbol
MISC	it makes a binary prediction  symbol  for  symbol ,  symbol  based on the maximum  a posteriori  probability which is defined as follows: suppose that the current state is  symbol  then the prediction is   symbol } where  symbol  is defined as  symbol  for the state  symbol  obtained from  symbol  by a type-1 transition, i e , if  symbol  then  symbol
MISC	the corresponding true probability value is denoted by  symbol
OWNX	we now prove the claim which will be used in section
MISC	let us denote by  symbol ,  symbol ,  symbol , the particular sequence of states corresponding to the sequence  symbol
OWNX	to show the dependence of  symbol  on  symbol  we will sometimes write  symbol
MISC	for instance, if  symbol  then the state sequence  symbol  is valid but  symbol  is not valid
MISC	for any state  symbol  denote by  symbol  the random variable whose value is the number of type-1 transitions from state  symbol  in a sequence of random states  symbol
MISC	let  symbol  be a non-negative integer parameter and define the random variable  symbol
MISC	associate a conditional probability function with parameter  symbol  for the random variable  symbol  as  symbol  then the right side of () equals symbol } for a fixed value of  symbol  the event {}`` symbol '' is equivalent to the event {}`` symbol ''
MISC	hence alternatively, the right side of () can be expressed as  symbol } the right side of () is a product of probability functions of the random variables  symbol
MISC	so conditioned on  symbol  and on the event that  symbol  corresponds to a valid state sequence  symbol , the event that  symbol  is generated by the source markov chain  symbol  is equivalent to the event that its corresponding state sequence  symbol  has transition frequencies  symbol  that independently take the particular values  symbol  as prescribed in  symbol
MISC	it also follows that  symbol  is the average of independent bernoulli trials (success taken as a type-1 transition from state  symbol )
MISC	it is distributed according to the binomial distribution with parameters  symbol  and  symbol
MISC	problem setting : let  symbol  and  symbol  be positive integers
MISC	all probability values are measured according to  symbol
MISC	denote by  symbol
MISC	denote by  symbol
MISC	let  symbol  be a data-sequence obtained by randomly drawing according to  symbol
MISC	let  symbol  denote the number of times that state  symbol  appears in  symbol ,  symbol
MISC	after training, the learner's decision at state  symbol  is to output  symbol  if  symbol  else output  symbol
MISC	denote by  symbol  the probability that a binomial random variable with parameters  symbol ,  symbol , is larger (or smaller) than  symbol  given that  symbol  is smaller (or larger) than  symbol , respectively
MISC	let  symbol
MISC	let  symbol
MISC	using  symbol  the learner is tested incrementally on the remaining  symbol  bits  symbol  of the data and predicts an output bit  symbol  for bit  symbol  in  symbol  to be  symbol  if  symbol , else  symbol
MISC	denote by  symbol  the sequence of mistakes where  symbol  if  symbol , and  symbol  otherwise,  symbol
MISC	denote by  symbol ,  symbol , the subsequence of  symbol  with time instants  symbol  corresponding to  symbol -predictions,  symbol ,  symbol
OWNX	before presenting the proof we make the following remarks,   the effect of the training sequence length  symbol  on  symbol  is as  symbol  which is  symbol
MISC	as  symbol  increases the class of possible learnt models (hypothesis class) decreases in size thereby decreasing the bound  symbol  on the deviation of the error sequence
MISC	the effect of the length  symbol  of the error sequence on  symbol  is as  symbol
MISC	clearly, the longer the subsequence the less chance that its frequency of 1s deviate from the mean  symbol
MISC	as the dependence increases,  symbol  decreases which increases the possible deviation size  symbol
MISC	as  symbol  decreases, the bits of the sequence  symbol  become less dependent and  symbol  decreases
OWNX	we analyze a natural reduction of this problem to a set of binary regression problems organized in a tree structure, proving a regret bound that scales with the depth of the tree
OWNX	motivated by this analysis, we propose the first online algorithm which provably constructs a logarithmic depth tree on the set of labels to solve this problem
OWNX	we test the algorithm empirically, showing that it works succesfully on a dataset with roughly  symbol  labels
MISC	virtually all approaches for solving this problem require  symbol  time
MISC	a commonly used one-against-all approach, which tries to predict the probability of label  symbol  versus all other labels, for each  symbol ,  requires  symbol  time per training example
MISC	another common  symbol  approach is to learn a scoring function  symbol  and convert it into a conditional probability estimate according to  symbol , where  symbol  is a normalization factor
OWNX	the motivation for dealing with the computational difficulty is the usual one---we want the capability to solve otherwise unsolvable problems
OWNX	for example, one of our experiments involves a probabilistic prediction problem with roughly  symbol  labels and  symbol  examples, where any  symbol  solution is intractable
MISC	for a variety of regularized optimization problems in machine learning,  algorithms computing the entire solution path have been developed recently
MISC	most of these methods are quadratic programs that are parameterized by a single parameter, as for example the support vector machine (svm)
MISC	solution path algorithms do not only compute the solution for one particular value of the regularization parameter but the entire path of solutions, making the selection of an optimal parameter much easier
MISC	it has been assumed that these piecewise linear solution paths have only linear complexity, ie \ linearly many bends
OWNX	we prove that for the support vector machine this complexity can be exponential in the number of training points in the worst case
MISC	these regularization methods have in common that they are convex, usually quadratic, optimization problems containing a special parameter in their objective function, called the regularization parameter, representing the tradeoff between two optimization objectives
MISC	in machine learning the two terms are usually the model complexity (regularization term) and the accuracy on the training data (loss term), or in other words the tradeoff between a good generalization performance and over-fitting
MISC	such parameterized quadratic programming problems have been studied extensively in both optimization and machine learning, resulting in many algorithms that are able to not only compute solutions at a single value of  the parameter, but along the whole solution path as the parameter varies
MISC	for many variants, it is known that the solution paths are piecewise linear functions in the parameter, however, the complexity of these paths remained unknown
OWNX	here we prove that the complexity of the solution path for svms, which  are simple instances of parameterized quadratic programs, is indeed  exponential in the worst case
OWNX	furthermore, our example shows that  exponentially many distinct subsets of support vectors of the optimal  solution occur as the regularization parameter changes
MISC	here  the ``exponentially many'' is valid both in terms of the number of input  points and also in the dimension of the space containing the points
MISC	for a wide variety of regularization methods, algorithms computing the entire solution path have been developed recently
MISC	solution path algorithms do not only compute the solution for one particular value of the regularization parameter but the entire path of solutions, making the selection of an optimal parameter much easier
OWNX	here we present a new robust, generic method for parametric quadratic programming
OWNX	our algorithm directly applies to nearly all machine learning applications, where so far every application required its own different algorithm
OWNX	we illustrate the usefulness of our method by applying it to a very low rank problem which could not be solved by existing path tracking methods, namely to compute part-worth values in choice based conjoint analysis, a popular technique from market research to estimate consumers preferences on a class of parameterized options
OWNX	we study a combinatorial algorithm to solve parameterized quadratic programs, i e , to compute the whole solution path
OWNX	unlike other methods employed in machine learning, our algorithm can deal with singular objective function matrices, without perturbing the input
OWNX	we will briefly review some applications here, and we will also study another application, namely choice based conjoint analysis in more detail
MISC	conjoint analysis comprises a popular family of techniques mostly used in market research to assess consumers' preferences on a set of options that are specified by multiple parameters, see~ citation  for an overview and recent developments
OWNX	we will show that a regularization approach to the analysis of preference data leads to a parameterized quadratic program with a sparse, low rank positive semi-definite matrix describing the quadratic term of the objective function
MISC	a prior information composed of correlations among a large set of  symbol  variables, is encoded into a graphical model; this encoding is optimized with respect to an approximate decoding procedure (\textsc{lbp}), which is used to infer hidden variables from an observed subset
OWNX	considering a single parameter family of models we show how \textsc{lpb} may be used to encode and decode efficiently such information, without solving the np hard inverse problem yielding the optimal \textsc{mrf}
OWNX	contrary to usual practice, we work in the non-convex bethe free energy minimization framework, and manage to associate a belief propagation fixed point to each component of the underlying probabilistic mixture
MISC	the mean field limit is considered and yields an exact connection with the hopfield model at finite temperature and steady state, when the number of mixture components is proportional to the number of variables
OWNX	in addition, we provide an enhanced learning procedure, based on a straightforward multi-parameter extension of the model in conjunction with an effective continuous optimization procedure
MISC	this is performed using the stochastic search heuristic \textsc{cmaes} and yields a significant improvement with respect to the single parameter basic model
MISC	prediction or recognition methods on systems in a random environment have somehow to exploit regularities or correlations, possibly both spatial and temporal, to infer a global behavior from partial observations
MISC	for example, on a road-traffic network, one is interested to extract, from fixed sensors and floating car data, an estimation of the overall traffic situation and its evolution~ citation
OWNX	the natural probabilistic tool to encode mutual information is the markov random field (\textsc{mrf}), which marginal conditional probabilities have to be computed for the prediction or recognition process
MISC	such marginals are typically the result of some empirical procedure producing historical data
MISC	based on this historical information,  consider then a situation where some of the variables are observed, say a subset  symbol , while  the other one, the complementary set  symbol , remains hidden
MISC	there are two main issues:    inverse problem : how to set the parameters of () in order to fulfill the constraints imposed by the historical data
MISC	inference : how to decode (in the sense of computing marginals) in the most efficient manner---typically in real time---this information, in terms of conditional probabilities  symbol
MISC	exact procedures generally face an exponential complexity problem both for the encoding and decoding procedures and one has to resort to approximate procedures~ citation
MISC	the bethe approximation~ citation , which is used in statistical physics consists in minimizing an approximate version of the variational free energy associated to~()
MISC	in computer science, the belief propagation \textsc{bp} algorithm~ citation  is a message passing procedure that allows to compute efficiently exact marginal probabilities when the underlying graph is a tree
MISC	however, there may be several fixed points, either stable or unstable
MISC	it has been shown that these points coincide with stationary points of the bethe free energy~ citation  which is defined as follows:  in addition, stable fixed points of \textsc{lbp} are local minima of the bethe free energy~ citation
MISC	the question of convergence of \textsc{lbp} has been addressed in a series of works~ citation  establishing conditions and bounds on the \textsc{mrf} coefficients for having global convergence
OWNX	in the present work, we reverse the viewpoint
MISC	since the decoding procedure is performed with \textsc{lbp}, presumably the best encoding of the historical data is the one for which \textsc{lbp}'s output is  symbol  in absence of ``real time'' information, that is when all the variables remain hidden ( symbol )
MISC	this has actually been proposed in~ citation , where it is proved in a specific case, that working with the ``wrong'' model, i e \ the message passing approximate version, yields better results from the decoding viewpoint
AIMX	in this paper, we propose  a new  approach, based on multiple fixed points of \textsc{lbp} identification, able to deal both with the encoding and decoding  procedure in a consistent way, suitable for real time applications
AIMX	the paper is organized as follows: our inference strategy is detailed in section~; in section~, we specify the problem to the inference of binary variables which distribution follows a mixture of product forms and present some numerical results; these are analyzed in section~ in the light of some scaling limits where mean field equations become relevant, allowing for a direct connection with the hopfield model
OWNX	in section~ we propose a multi-parameter extension of the model well suited to a continuous optimization, which allows to enhance the performance of the model
OWNX	finally we conclude in section~ by comparing our approach with other variant of \textsc{lbp} and giving perspective for future developments
MISC	the standard goal for predictor in learning theory is to incur a small loss for a given loss function measuring the discrepancy between the predictions and the actual outcomes
MISC	competitive on-line learning concentrates on a ``relative'' version of this goal: the predictor is to perform almost as well as the best strategies in a given benchmark class of prediction strategies
MISC	such predictions can be interpreted as decisions made by a ``small'' decision maker (i e , one whose decisions do not affect the future outcomes)
MISC	predictions, or  probability forecasts , considered in the foundations of probability are statements rather than decisions; the loss function is replaced by a procedure for testing the forecasts
MISC	an important achievement of kolmogorov's school of the foundations of probability was construction of a universal testing procedure and realization (levin, 1976) that there exists a forecasting strategy that produces ideal forecasts
MISC	levin's ideal forecasting strategy, however, is not computable
MISC	its more practical versions can be obtained from the results of game-theoretic probability theory
MISC	for a wide class of forecasting protocols, it can be shown that for any computable game-theoretic law of probability there exists a computable forecasting strategy that produces ideal forecasts, as far as this law of probability is concerned
OWNX	choosing suitable laws of probability we can ensure that the forecasts agree with reality in requisite ways
MISC	probability forecasts that are known to agree with reality can be used for making good decisions: the most straightforward procedure is to select decisions that are optimal under the forecasts (the principle of minimum expected loss)
MISC	in recent years colt invited talks have tended to aim at establishing connections between the traditional concerns of the learning community and the work done by other communities (such as game theory, statistics, information theory, and optimization)
MISC	following this tradition, i will argue that some ideas from the foundations of probability can be fruitfully applied in competitive on-line learning
MISC	they can never be true or false but can be good or bad
MISC	they can be tested and, if found inadequate, rejected as false [f-predictions] (or frequentist predictions) are intermediate between d-pre\-dic\-tions and s-predictions
MISC	they are successful if they match the fre\-quen\-cies of various observed events
MISC	traditionally, learning theory in general and competitive on-line learning in particular consider d-predictions
OWNX	i will start, in section , from a simple asymptotic result about d-predictions: there exists a universally consistent on-line prediction algorithm (randomized if the loss function is not required to be convex in the prediction)
OWNX	section  is devoted to s-prediction and section  to f-prediction
OWNX	we will see that s-prediction is more fundamental than, and can serve as a tool for, f-prediction
OWNX	section  explains how f-prediction (and so, indirectly, s-prediction) is relevant for d-prediction
OWNX	in section  i will prove the result of section  about universal consistency, as well as its non-asymptotic version
OWNX	we study the regret of optimal strategies for online convex optimization games
OWNX	we use this expression to obtain upper and lower bounds on the regret of an optimal strategy for a variety of online learning problems
OWNX	our method provides upper bounds without the need to construct a learning algorithm; the lower bounds provide explicit optimal strategies for the adversary
MISC	within the theory of learning, two particular topics have gained significant popularity over the past 20 years: statistical learning and online adversarial learning
MISC	papers on the former typically study generalization bounds, convergence rates, complexity measures of function classes---all under the assumption that the examples are drawn, typically in an  iid 
MISC	manner, from some underlying distribution
MISC	working under such an assumption, statistical learning finds its roots in statistics, probability theory, high-dimensional geometry, and one can argue that the main questions are by now relatively well-understood
MISC	online learning, while having its origins in the early 90's, recently became a popular area of research once again
MISC	indeed, it is often assumed that the observed data is generated maliciously rather than being drawn from some fixed distribution
MISC	it is no surprise that this adversarial learning seems quite a bit more difficult than its statistical cousin
OWNX	the worst case adversarial analysis does provide a realistic modeling in learning scenarios such as network security applications, email spam detection, network routing etc , which is largely responsible for the renewed interest in this area
MISC	upon a review of the central results in adversarial online learning---most of which can be found in the recent book cesa-bianchi and lugosi  citation ---one cannot help but notice frequent similarities between the guarantees on performance of online algorithms and the analogous guarantees under stochastic assumptions
MISC	however, discerning an explicit link has remained elusive
MISC	vovk  citation  notices this phenomenon: ``for some important problems, the adversarial bounds of on-line competitive learning theory are only a tiny amount worse than the average-case bounds for some stochastic strategies of nature
OWNX	using von neumann's minimax theorem, we show that the optimal regret of an algorithm for online convex optimization is exactly the difference between a sum of minimal expected losses and the minimal empirical loss, under an adversarial choice of a stochastic process generating the data
MISC	the online convex optimization game proceeds in rounds
MISC	at each of these  symbol  rounds, the player (learner) predicts a vector in some convex set, and the adversary responds with a convex function which determines the player's loss at the chosen point
OWNX	in order to emphasize the relationship with the stochastic setting, we denote the player's choice as  symbol  and the adversary's choice as  symbol
MISC	suppose  symbol  is a  convex compact  class of functions, which constitutes the set of player's choices
MISC	the adversary draws his choices from a  closed compact  set  symbol
MISC	denote by  symbol  the associated loss class
MISC	let  symbol  be the set of all probability distributions on  symbol
MISC	denote a sequence  symbol  by  symbol
MISC	an adaptive way to estimate the probability density is to recursively subdivide the domain to an appropriate data-dependent granularity
MISC	in bayesian inference one assigns a data-independent prior probability to ``subdivide'', which leads to a prior over infinite(ly many) trees
OWNX	we derive an exact, fast, and simple inference algorithm for such a prior, for the data evidence, the predictive distribution, the effective model dimension, moments, and other quantities
OWNX	we prove asymptotic convergence and consistency results, and illustrate the behavior of our model on some prototypical functions
OWNX	we consider the problem of inference from  iid  \ data  symbol , in particular of the unknown distribution  symbol  the data is sampled from
MISC	in parametric estimation one assumes that  symbol  belongs to a finite-dimensional family
MISC	the maximum likelihood (ml) estimate of  symbol  is the distribution that maximizes the data likelihood
MISC	maximum likelihood overfits if the family is too large and especially if it is infinite-dimensional
MISC	a remedy is to penalize complex distributions by assigning a prior (2nd order) probability to the densities  symbol
MISC	maximizing the model posterior (map), which is proportional to likelihood times the prior, prevents overfitting
OWNX	a full bayesian procedure keeps the complete posterior for inference
MISC	typically, summaries like the mean and variance of the posterior are reported }  \paranodot{how to choose the prior } in finite or small compact low-dimensional spaces a uniform prior often works (map reduces to ml)
OWNX	in a full bayesian treatment one would assign a prior probability (e g \  symbol ) to the dimension  symbol   and mix over the dimension
MISC	the probably simplest and oldest model for an interval domain is to divide the interval (uniformly) into bins, assume a constant distribution within each bin, and take a frequency estimate for the probability in each bin (figure ), or a dirichlet posterior in bayesian inference
MISC	there are heuristics for choosing the number of bins as a function of the data size
MISC	the simplicity and easy computability of the bin model is very appealing to practitioners
MISC	drawbacks are that distributions are discontinuous, its restriction to one dimension (or at most low dimension: curse of dimensionality), the uniform (or more generally fixed) discretization, and the heuristic choice of the number of bins
OWNX	we present a full bayesian solution to these problems, except for the non-continuity problem
MISC	there are plenty of alternative bayesian models that overcome some or all of the limitations
MISC	examples are % continuous dirichlet process (mixtures)  citation , % bernstein polynomials  citation , % bayesian field theory  citation , % randomized polya trees  citation , % bayesian bins with boundary averaging  citation , % bayesian kernel density estimation % or other mixture models  citation , and universal priors  citation , % but exact analytical solutions are infeasible
MISC	there are of course also plenty of non-bayesian density estimators; see (references in)  citation  in general, and  citation  for density tree estimation in particular
MISC	for finitely many splits,  symbol  is a piecewise constant function, for infinitely many splits it is virtually  any  distribution
OWNX	the method is a full bayesian non-heuristic tree approach to adaptive binning for which we present a very simple and fast algorithm for computing all( ) quantities of interest
OWNX	note that we are not arguing that our model performs better in practice than the more advanced models above
OWNX	the main distinguishing feature of our model is that it allows for a fast and exact analytical solution
MISC	it's likely use is as a building block in complex problems, where computation time and bayesian integration are the major issues
OWNX	in any case, if/since the polya tree model deserves attention, also our model should

MISC	given a time series of multicomponent measurements  symbol , the usual objective of nonlinear blind source separation (bss) is to find a ``source" time series  symbol , comprised of statistically independent combinations of the measured components
OWNX	separability is shown to impose constraints on certain locally invariant (scalar) functions of  symbol , which are derived from local higher-order correlations of the data's velocity  symbol
MISC	the data are separable if and only if they satisfy these constraints, and, if the constraints are satisfied, the sources can be explicitly constructed from the data
MISC	the method is illustrated by using it to separate two speech-like sounds recorded with a single microphone
MISC	sensory devices often receive signals from multiple physical stimuli that evolve simultaneously but are unrelated to one another
MISC	in many of these situations, it is necessary to create separate representations of one or more of these stimuli by blindly processing the observed signals (i e , by processing them without prior knowledge of the nature of the stimuli)
MISC	in recent years, there has be considerable progress in the solution of this ``blind source separation" (bss) problem for the special case in which the signals and source variables are linearly related
MISC	however, although nonlinear bss is often performed effortlessly by humans, computational methods for doing this are quite limited~ citation
MISC	consider a time series of data  symbol , where  symbol  is a multiplet of  symbol  measurements ( symbol )
MISC	in other words, the problem is to find a coordinate transformation  symbol  that transforms the observed data  symbol  from the measurement-defined coordinate system ( symbol ) on state space to a special source coordinate system ( symbol ) in which the components of the transformed data are statistically independent
MISC	let  symbol  be the state space probability density function (pdf) in the source coordinate system, defined so that  symbol  is the fraction of total time that the source trajectory  symbol  is located within the volume element  symbol  at location  symbol
MISC	however, it is well known that the criterion in () is so weak that it suffers from a much worse non-uniqueness problem: namely, in this form of the bss problem, multiple solutions can be created by transformations that mix the source variables (see~ citation  and references therein)
MISC	first, let  symbol  be the pdf in this space, defined so that  symbol  is the fraction of total time that the location and velocity of the source trajectory are within the volume element  symbol  at location  symbol
MISC	to see this, note that () can be recovered by integrating both sides of () over all velocities, but the latter equation cannot be deduced from the former one
MISC	in fact, it can be shown that () is strong enough to guarantee that the bss problem in  symbol  has a unique solution, up to permutations and component-wise transformations~ citation
MISC	furthermore, this type of statistical independence has the virtue of being satisfied by almost all classical physical systems that are composed of non-interacting subsystems, which are the generators of most signals of interest
MISC	this approach is advantageous because it requires much less data for an accurate computation
OWNX	for example, in the synthetic speech separation experiment in section iii, the new method can separate two synthetic utterances recorded with a single microphone after minutes of observation, rather than the hours of observation required by the differential geometric method
OWNX	the method described in this paper differs significantly from the methods proposed by other investigators because it uses a criterion of statistical independence in  symbol , instead of state space
MISC	in addition, there are technical differences between the proposed method and conventional ones
OWNX	furthermore, unlike many other methods~ citation , the mixing function is derived in a constructive, deterministic, and non-parametric manner, without employing iterative algorithms, without using probabilistic learning methods, and without parameterizing it with a neural network architecture or other means
OWNX	the next section describes how to separate two-dimensional data into two one-dimensional source variables
OWNX	section iii illustrates the method by using it to separate two simultaneous speech-like sounds that are recorded with a single microphone
OWNX	the implications of this work are discussed in the last section
CONT	our analysis helps compare the stability of these algorithms \ignore{it suggests that several existing algorithms might not be stable but prescribes a technique to make them stable }  it also shows that a number of widely used transductive regression algorithms are in fact unstable
OWNX	finally, it reports the results of experiments with local transductive regression demonstrating the benefit of our stability bounds for model selection, for one of the algorithms, in particular for determining the radius of the local neighborhood used by the algorithm
MISC	the problem of  transductive inference  was originally introduced by  citation
MISC	many learning problems in information extraction, computational biology, natural language processing and other domains can be formulated as a transductive inference problem
MISC	in the transductive setting, the learning algorithm receives both a labeled training set, as in the standard induction setting, and a set of unlabeled test points
MISC	no other test points will ever be considered
MISC	this setting arises in a variety of applications
MISC	often, there are orders of magnitude more unlabeled points than labeled ones and they have not been assigned a label due to the prohibitive cost of labeling
MISC	this motivates the use of transductive algorithms which leverage the unlabeled data during training to improve learning performance
MISC	several algorithms have been devised for the specific setting of transductive regression  citation
MISC	several other algorithms introduced for transductive classification can be viewed in fact as transductive regression ones as their objective function is based on the square loss, for example, in  citation
MISC	citation  gave explicit vc-dimension generalization bounds for transductive regression that hold for all bounded loss functions and coincide with the tight classification bounds of  citation  when applied to classification
OWNX	we present novel algorithm-dependent generalization bounds for transductive regression
MISC	since they are algorithm-specific, these bounds can often be tighter than bounds based on general complexity measures such as the vc-dimension
OWNX	in section~ we give a formal definition of the transductive inference learning set-up, including a precise description and discussion of two related transductive settings
OWNX	we also introduce the notions of cost and score stability used in the following sections
MISC	standard concentration bounds such as mcdiarmid's bound  citation  cannot be readily applied to the transductive regression setting since the points are not drawn independently but uniformly without replacement from a finite set
OWNX	instead, section~ proves a concentration bound generalizing mcdiarmid's bound to the case of random variables sampled without replacement
OWNX	this concentration bound is used to derive a general transductive regression stability bound in section~
OWNX	section~ introduces and examines a very general family of tranductive algorithms, that of local transductive regression (\ltr) algorithms, a generalization of the algorithm of  citation
OWNX	the stability analysis in this section is based on the notion of cost stability and based on convexity arguments
OWNX	in section~, we analyze a general class of unconstrained optimization algorithms that includes a number of recent algorithms  citation
OWNX	we use that to give a score-based stability analysis of these algorithms
OWNX	in fact, in section~ we prove a lower bound on the stability coefficient of these algorithms under some assumptions
OWNX	section~ examines a class of constrained regularization optimization algorithms for graphs that enjoy better stability properties than the unconstrained ones just mentioned
MISC	this includes the graph laplacian algorithm of  citation
OWNX	section~ shows that algorithms based on constrained graph regularizations are in fact special instances of the \ltr\ algorithms by showing that the regularization term can be written in terms of a norm in a reproducing kernel hilbert space
OWNX	these generalizations are briefly discussed in section~ where it is indicated, in particular, how similar constraints can be imposed to the algorithms of  citation  to derive new and stable versions of these algorithms
OWNX	by learning a convex body we mean finding a set having at most  symbol  relative symmetric difference with the input body
OWNX	our construction of this family is very simple and based on error correcting codes
MISC	we consider the following problem: given uniformly random points  from a convex body in  symbol , we would like to approximately learn the body with as few samples as possible
OWNX	our main result will show that this needs about  symbol  samples
MISC	this problem is a special case of the statistical problem of inferring  information about a probability distribution from samples
MISC	for example, one can approximate the centroid of the body with a sample of size roughly linear in  symbol
MISC	note that known approximation algorithms for the volume (e g ,  citation ) do not work in this setting as they need a membership oracle and random points from various carefully chosen subsets of the  input body
MISC	aside from different distributions, another difference between the learning setting of   citation  and ours is that in ours one gets only positive examples
MISC	klivans~et~al ~ citation  give an algorithm and a nearly matching lower bound for learning convex bodies  with labeled samples chosen according to the gaussian distribution
MISC	their algorithm takes time   symbol  and they also show a lower bound of  symbol
MISC	the problem of learning convex sets from uniformly random samples from them was raised by frieze~et~al ~ citation
MISC	they gave a polynomial time algorithm for learning parallelopipeds
MISC	note that it is known that estimating the volume of convex bodies requires an exponential number of  membership  queries if the algorithm is  deterministic   citation , which implies that learning bodies requires an exponential number of membership queries because if an algorithm can learn the body then it can also estimate its volume
OWNX	to formally define the notion of learning we need to specify a distance   symbol  between bodies
OWNX	a natural choice  in our setting is to consider the total variation distance of the uniform distribution on each body (see section )
MISC	remarkably, the lower bound of klivans~et~al ~ citation  is numerically essentially identical to  ours ( symbol  for  symbol  constant)
OWNX	we believe that our argument is considerably simpler, and elementary compared to that of  citation
OWNX	furthermore, our construction of the hard to learn family  is explicit
OWNX	our construction makes use of error correcting codes
MISC	since any two bodies are almost disjoint, even approximating a body would allow one to determine it exactly
MISC	this will imply that it is also hard to approximate
MISC	consider the cross polytope  symbol  in  symbol  (generalization of the octahedron to  symbol  dimensions: convex hull of the vectors  symbol , where  symbol  is the unit vector in  symbol  with the   symbol th coordinate  symbol  and the rest  symbol )
OWNX	we will show later that we can choose the height so that the volume of all the  symbol  peaks is  symbol  fraction of the volume of  symbol
MISC	we call this family of bodies  symbol  [we remark that our construction of cross-polytopes with peaks has resemblance to a construction in  citation  with different parameters, but there does not  seem to be any connection between the problem studied there and the problem we are interested in ]  intuitively, a random point in a body from this family tells one that if the point is in one of the peaks then that peak is present, otherwise one learns nothing
MISC	therefore if the number of queries is at most a polynomial in  symbol , then one learns nothing about most of the peaks and so the algorithm cannot tell which body it got
MISC	but these bodies do not have large symmetric difference (can be as small as a  symbol  fraction of the cross polytope if the two bodies differ in just one peak) but we can pick a subfamily of them having pairwise symmetric difference at least  symbol  by picking a large random subfamily
MISC	large sets of such strings are of course furnished by good error correcting codes
MISC	acknowledgments
OWNX	we are grateful to adam kalai and santosh vempala for useful discussions
OWNX	we are working with a new data set collected over a period of 7 years
OWNX	using the level of ca125 and mass-spectrometry peaks, our algorithm gives probability predictions for the disease
OWNX	to estimate classification accuracy we convert probability predictions into strict predictions
OWNX	our algorithm makes fewer errors than almost any linear combination of the ca125 level and one peak's intensity (taken on the log scale)
MISC	this leads to difficulties in treatment of the patient
MISC	using the antigen ca125 significantly improves the quality of diagnosis
OWNX	however, ca125 becomes less reliable at early stages and sometimes elevates too late to make use of it
OWNX	we refer to the  combination  of ca125 and peak intensity meaning the decision rule in the form  symbol *} where  symbol  is the level of ca125,  symbol  is the intensity of the  symbol -th peak, and  symbol  are taken from the sets described below
OWNX	in order to estimate classification accuracy, we convert probability predictions into strict predictions by the  maximum rule : we assign weight 1 to the labels with maximum predicted probability, weight 0 to the labels of other samples, and then normalize the assigned weights
OWNX	we show that our algorithm gives more reliable predictions than the vast majority of particular combinations (in fact, more thorough experiments, not described here, show that it outperforms all particular combinations)
MISC	it performs well on different stages of disease
OWNX	our paper is organized as follows
OWNX	in section~ we describe methods we use to give predictions
OWNX	section~ gives a short description of the data set on which we work
OWNX	we show our experiments and results in section~, separated into description of the probability prediction algorithm in subsection~ and detection at different stages before diagnosis in subsection~
OWNX	section~ concludes our paper
MISC	in statistical physics language, this problem is equivalent to computing the marginals of a one-dimensional model with a random external field
OWNX	while this task can be accomplished through transfer matrix methods,  it becomes quickly intractable when the underlying state space is large
MISC	hidden markov models (hmm's) are a workhorse of modern statistics and  machine learning, with applications ranging from speech recognition to biological sequence alignment, to pattern classification  citation
MISC	the conditional  distribution of the state sequence given the observations is, by bayes theorem,  symbol } where  symbol  can be thought as a normalization constant
MISC	the state sequence can then be estimated by the sequence of most likely states (symbol maximum a posteriori probability -map- estimation)  symbol } this reduces the inference problem to the problem of computing marginals of  symbol
MISC	from a statistical physics point of view  citation , the  conditional distribution () can be regarded as the boltzmann distribution of a one dimensional system with variables  symbol  and energy function  symbol } at temperature  symbol
MISC	the sequence of observations thus act  as a quenched external field
MISC	in the present context this is also known as the bahl-cocke-jelinek-raviv (bcjr) algorithm  citation
MISC	more precisely, the complexity in  symbol  is the same as  multiplying an  symbol  matrix times an  symbol  vector
OWNX	while this is easy for simple models with a few states, it becomes intractable for complex models
OWNX	in all of these cases, the model can be reduced to a standard hmm via state space augmentation, but the augmented  state space becomes exponential in the memory length
OWNX	we study the proposed method on a concrete model used in dna pyrosequencing
OWNX	in this case, one is interested in inferring the  underlying dna sequence from an absorption signal that carries  traces of the base type at several positions
MISC	the effective memory length scales roughly as the square root of the sequence length, thus making plain transfer matrix impractical
OWNX	the next section will define the  concrete model we study, and section  describes the connection with dna pyrosequencing to motivate it
OWNX	section  describes the transfer matrix algorithm and several low complexity approximation schemes
OWNX	after describing a few bounds in , numerical and analytical results are collected in section  \\
MISC	boosting is of great interest recently in the machine learning community because  of the impressive performance for classification and regression problems
MISC	the success of boosting algorithms may be interpreted in terms of the margin theory   citation
MISC	recently, it has been shown that generalization error of classifiers can be obtained by explicitly taking the margin distribution of the training data into account
MISC	most of the current boosting algorithms in practice usually optimize a convex loss function and do not make use of the margin distribution
MISC	given a training dataset, boosting builds a   strong  classifier using only a  weak  learning algorithm   citation
MISC	a strong classifier has a much better test error
MISC	later, breiman  citation  and friedman  citation  observed that many boosting algorithms can be viewed as gradient descent optimization in functional space
MISC	mason  citation  developed  anyboost for boosting arbitrary loss functions with a similar idea
MISC	despite the large success in practice of these boosting algorithms, there are still open questions about why and how boosting works
MISC	inspired by the large-margin theory in kernel methods,  schapire   citation  presented a margin-based bound for adaboost, which tries to interpret adaboost's success with the margin theory
MISC	although the margin theory provides a qualitative explanation of the effectiveness  of boosting, the bounds are quantitatively weak
MISC	it   is very similar to adaboost (only different  in calculating the coefficient associated with each weak classifier) such that  it increases margins even more aggressively than adaboost
MISC	grove and schuurmans  citation  observed the same phenomenon
MISC	in the literature, much work has focused on maximizing the minimum margin  citation
MISC	recently, reyzin and schapire  citation  re-ran breiman's experiments by controlling weak classifiers' complexity
MISC	they found that a better margin distribution is more important than the minimum margin
MISC	it is of importance to have a large minimum margin, but not at the expense of other factors
MISC	they thus conjectured that maximizing the average margin rather than the minimum margin may lead to improved boosting algorithms
OWNX	we try to verify this conjecture in this work
MISC	recently, garg and roth  citation   introduced margin distribution based complexity measure for learning classifiers and developed margin distribution based generalization bounds
MISC	competitive classification results have been shown by optimizing this bound
MISC	another relevant work is  citation
MISC	citation  applies a boosting method to optimize the margin distribution based generalization bound obtained by   citation
OWNX	aligned with these attempts, we propose a new boosting algorithm through optimization of margin distribution (termed mdboost)
OWNX	instead of minimizing a margin distribution based generalization bound, we directly optimize the margin distribution: maximizing the average margin and at the same time minimizing the variance of the margin distribution
OWNX	the main contributions of our work are as follows
OWNX	we propose a new totally-corrective boosting algorithm, mdboost, by optimizing the margin distribution directly
MISC	the optimization procedure of mdboost is based on the idea of  column generation that has been widely used in large-scale linear programming
OWNX	we empirically demonstrate that mdboost outperforms adaboost and lpboost on most uci datasets used in our experiments
MISC	the success of mdboost verifies the conjecture in    citation
MISC	adaboost-cg  is also totally-corrective in the sense  that all the linear coefficients of the weak classifiers are updated during the training
MISC	an advantage of mdboost is that,  at each iteration, mdboost solves a quadratic program while adaboost-cg needs to solve a general convex program
MISC	the  symbol th row of  symbol  is denoted by  symbol  and the  symbol th column  symbol
OWNX	we use  symbol  to denote the identity matrix
MISC	their sizes will be clear from the context
OWNX	we use  symbol  to denote component-wise inequalities
OWNX	in section  we present the main idea
OWNX	experimental verification has been the method of choice for verifying the stability of a multi-agent reinforcement learning (marl) algorithm as the number of agents grows and theoretical analysis becomes prohibitively complex
MISC	for cooperative  agents, where the ultimate goal is to optimize some global metric, the stability is usually verified by observing the evolution of the global performance metric over time
MISC	if the global metric improves and eventually stabilizes, it is considered a reasonable verification of the system's stability
MISC	the main contribution of this note is establishing the need for better experimental frameworks and measures to assess the stability of large-scale adaptive cooperative systems
OWNX	we show an experimental case study where the stability of the global performance metric can be rather deceiving, hiding an underlying instability in the system that later leads to a significant drop in performance
OWNX	we then propose an alternative metric that relies on  agents' local policies and show, experimentally, that our proposed metric is more effective (than the traditional global performance metric) in exposing the instability of marl algorithms
MISC	the term  convergence , in reinforcement learning context, refers to the stability of the learning process (and the underlying model) over time
MISC	similar to single agent reinforcement learning algorithms (such as q-learning  citation ), the convergence of a multi-agent reinforcement learning (marl) algorithm is an important property that received considerable attention  citation
MISC	however, proving the convergence of a marl algorithm via theoretical analysis is significantly more challenging than proving the convergence in the single agent case
MISC	the presence of other agents that are also learning deem the environment non-stationary, therefore violating a foundational assumption in single agent learning
MISC	in fact, proving the convergence of marl algorithm even in 2-player-2-action single-stage games (arguably the simplest class of multi-agent systems domains) has been challenging  citation
MISC	for cooperative agents, researchers typically verified  the stability of a marl algorithm by observing the evolution of some global performance metric overtime  citation
MISC	this is not surprising since the ultimate goal of a cooperative system is to optimize some global metric
MISC	examples of global performance metrics include the percentage of total number of delivered packets in routing problems  citation , the average turn around time of tasks in task allocation problems   citation , or the average reward (received by agents) in general  citation
MISC	if the global metric improves over time and eventually  appears  to stabilize, it is usually considered a reasonable verification of convergence  citation
MISC	even if the underlying agent policies are not stable, one could argue that at the end, global performance is all that matters in a cooperative system
OWNX	we show an experimental case study where the stability of the global performance metric can hide an underlying instability in the system
OWNX	we propose an alternative measure that relies on agents' local policies: the policy entropy
OWNX	section  reviews marl algorithms (with particular focus on wpl and giga-wolf, the two algorithms we use in our experimental evaluation)
OWNX	section  presents our initial experimental results, where the global performance metric leads to a (misleading) conclusion that a marl algorithm converges
OWNX	section  presents our proposed measure and illustrates how it is used to expose the hidden instability of a marl algorithm
OWNX	we conclude in section
OWNX	we describe a preliminary investigation into learning a chess player's style from game records
MISC	the method is based on attempting to learn features of a player's individual evaluation function using the method of temporal differences, with the aid of a conventional chess engine architecture
OWNX	some encouraging results were obtained in learning the styles of two recent chess world champions, and we report on our attempt to use the learnt styles to discriminate between the players from game records by trying to detect who was playing white and who was playing black
MISC	in chess, as in other popular strategic board games, players have different styles
MISC	for example, in chess some players are more ``positional'' and other more ``tactical'', and this difference in style will affect their move choice in any given board position, and more generally their overall plan
AIMX	the problem we tackle in this paper is that of applying machine learning to teach a computer to discriminate between players based on their style
OWNX	before we explain our methodology, we briefly review the method of temporal difference learning, which is central to our approach
MISC	temporal difference learning  citation  is a machine learning technique, originating from the seminal work of samuel  citation , in which learning occurs by minimising the differences between predictions and actual outcomes of a temporal sequence of observations
MISC	samuel  citation  used the game of checkers as a vehicle to study the feasibility of a computer learning from experience
MISC	although the program written by samuel did not achieve master strength, it was the precursor of the checkers program chinook  citation , which was the first computer program to win a match against a human world champion (see  citation  for a detailed, but less technical, description of the machine learning in samuel's checkers program )  tesauro  citation  demonstrated the power of this technique by showing that temporal difference learning, combined with using a neural network, can enable a program to learn to play backgammon at an expert level through self-play
MISC	following this approach, there have been similar efforts in applying this technique to the games of chess  citation , go  citation , othello  citation  and chinese chess  citation
MISC	self-play is time consuming, so it is natural to try to make use of existing game records of strong players to train the evaluation function, as in  citation  (in which, however, the temporal difference training did not employ minimax lookahead)
MISC	learning from game records has also been used in the game of go  citation  to extract patterns for move prediction, using methods other than temporal difference learning
MISC	all the learning module observes is the sequence of moves played in each game
OWNX	looking at it from a different perspective, we can view the problem as one of classification
MISC	at an even higher level, the problem can be recast as a turing test for chess  citation , where a computer may fool a human that it is a human player
MISC	in some sense this may already be true for the strongest available computer chess programs  citation , as computers have already surpassed humans in their playing strength, mainly due to increased computing power and relying on brute-force calculations
MISC	moreover, there seems to be a high correlation between the choices made by top human chess grandmasters and world class chess engines (see  citation )
OWNX	we will not discuss the turing test debate further and, from now on, we will concentrate on the classification problem within the domain of chess
MISC	of course, if the player under consideration is very strong, for example kasparov or kramnik, then the resulting program is likely to improve; but the method could also be used to learn the evaluation functions of weaker players
OWNX	the learning algorithm described in section~, based on sutton's td(0)  citation , corresponds to the simplest rule, which updates only the current predictions
OWNX	we note that a more general formulation proposed by sutton is td( symbol ); this utilises a decay factor  symbol  between 0 and 1, and forces the algorithm to also take into account earlier predictions
MISC	however, these concepts are difficult to formulate in a precise manner and, moreover, it is not clear how to translate them into an algorithmic framework
OWNX	we discuss these and other issues in subsection~
OWNX	in section~ we give our concluding remarks
OWNX	we derive an exact and efficient bayesian regression algorithm for piecewise constant functions of unknown segment number, boundary location, and levels
OWNX	we derive simple but good estimates for the in-segment variance
OWNX	we also propose a bayesian regression curve as a better way of smoothing data without blurring boundaries
MISC	the bayesian approach also allows straightforward determination of the evidence, break probabilities and error estimates, useful for model selection and significance and robustness studies
OWNX	we discuss the performance on synthetic and real-world examples
MISC	many possible extensions will be discussed
OWNX	we consider the problem of fitting a piecewise constant function through noisy one-dimensional data, as eg \ in figure , where the segment number, boundaries and levels are unknown
OWNX	regression with piecewise constant (pc) functions, also known as change point detection, has many applications
OWNX	we provide a full bayesian analysis of pc-regression
OWNX	from this we obtain the posterior segmentation probability distribution (section )
OWNX	in practice we need summaries of this complicated distribution
MISC	a simple maximum (map) approximation or mean does not work here
OWNX	we also extract the evidence, the boundary probability distribution, and an interesting non-pc regression curve including error estimate (section )
OWNX	we derive an exact polynomial-time dynamic-programming-type algorithm for all quantities of interest (sections  and )
OWNX	our algorithm works for any noise and level prior
OWNX	we consider more closely the gaussian ``standard'' prior and heavy-tailed robust-to-outliers distributions like the cauchy, and briefly discuss the non-parametric case (sections  and )
OWNX	we introduce and discuss efficient semi-principled estimators, thereby avoiding problematic or expensive numerical em or monte-carlo estimates (section )
OWNX	we test our method on some synthetic examples (section ) and some real-world data sets (section )
OWNX	the simulations show that our method handles difficult data with high noise and outliers well
OWNX	our basic algorithm can (easily) be modified in a variety of ways: for discrete segment levels, segment dependent variance, piecewise linear and non-linear regression, non-parametric noise prior, etc (section )
MISC	sen and srivastava  citation  developed a frequentist solution to the problem of detecting a single (the most prominent) segment boundary (called change or break point)
MISC	olshen et al \  citation  generalize this method to detect pairs of break points, which improves recognition of short segments
MISC	both methods are then (heuristically) used to recursively determine further change points
MISC	another approach is penalized maximum likelihood (ml)
MISC	for a fixed number of segments, ml chooses the boundary locations that maximize the data likelihood (minimize the mean square data deviation)
MISC	an additional penalty term has to be added to the likelihood in order to determine the correct number of segments
MISC	the most principled penalty is the bayesian information criterion  citation
MISC	since it can be biased towards too simple  citation  or too complex  citation  models, in practice often a heuristic penalty is used
MISC	an interesting heuristic, based on the curvature of the log-likelihood as a function of the number of segments, has been used in  citation
MISC	many other regressors exist; too numerous to list them all
MISC	another closely related work to ours is bayesian bin density estimation by endres and f\"oldi\'ak  citation , who also average over all boundary locations, but in the context of density estimation
MISC	this is particularly important for estimating the number of segments
MISC	another generic advantage is that it can be easily embedded in a larger framework
MISC	for instance, one can decide among competing models solely based on the (bayesian) evidence
MISC	finally, bayes often works well in practice, and provably so if the model assumptions are valid
OWNX	we can also extract other information (nearly for free), like probability estimates and variances for the various quantities of interest
MISC	particularly interesting is the expected level (and variance) of each data point
MISC	this leads to a regression curve, which is very flat, i e \ smoothes the data, in long and clear segments, wiggles in less clear segments, follows trends, and jumps at the segment boundaries
OWNX	we present a method for learning max-weight matching predictors in bipartite graphs
OWNX	although inference is in general hard, we show that for one very relevant application--web page ranking--exact inference is efficient
OWNX	contrary to existing max-margin matching models, our approach is statistically consistent and, in addition, experiments with increasing sample sizes indicate superior improvement over such models
OWNX	we apply the method to graph matching in computer vision as well as to a standard benchmark dataset for learning web page ranking, in which we obtain state-of-the-art results, in particular improving on max-margin variants
MISC	the maximum-weight bipartite matching problem (henceforth `matching problem') is a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization  citation
MISC	an exact optimal solution can be found in cubic time by standard methods such as the hungarian algorithm
MISC	this problem is of practical interest because it can nicely model real-world applications
MISC	for example, in computer vision the crucial problem of finding a correspondence between sets of image features is often modeled as a matching problem  citation
MISC	ranking algorithms can be based on a matching framework  citation , as can clustering algorithms  citation
MISC	when modeling a problem as one of matching, one central question is the choice of the weight matrix
OWNX	the problem is that in real applications we typically observe edge  feature vectors , not edge weights
MISC	consider a concrete example in computer vision: it is difficult to tell what the `similarity score' is between two image feature points, but it is straightforward to extract feature vectors (e g ~sift) associated with those points
MISC	this idea of `parameterizing algorithms' and then optimizing for agreement with data is called  structured estimation   citation
MISC	citation  and  citation  describe max-margin structured estimation formalisms for this problem
MISC	max-margin structured estimators are appealing in that they  try  to minimize the loss that one really cares about (`structured losses', of which the hamming loss is an example)
MISC	however structured losses are typically piecewise constant in the parameters, which eliminates any hope of using smooth optimization directly
MISC	max-margin estimators instead minimize a surrogate loss which is easier to optimize, namely a convex upper bound on the structured loss  citation
MISC	in practice the results are often good, but known convex relaxations produce estimators which are statistically inconsistent  citation , i e ,~the algorithm in general fails to obtain the best attainable model in the limit of infinite training data
MISC	the inconsistency of multiclass support vector machines is a well-known issue in the literature that has received careful examination recently  citation
AIMX	motivated by the inconsistency issues of max-margin structured estimators as well as by the well-known benefits of having a full probabilistic model, in this paper we present a maximum a posteriori (map) estimator for the matching problem
OWNX	we build an exponential family model where the sufficient statistics are such that the mode of the distribution (the prediction) is the solution of a max-weight matching problem
MISC	the resulting partition function is  symbol p-complete to compute exactly
OWNX	however, we show that for  learning to rank  applications the model instance is tractable
OWNX	we show very competitive results on standard webpage ranking datasets, and in particular we show that our model performs better than or on par with dorm
OWNX	for intractable model instances, we show that the problem can be approximately solved using sampling and we provide experiments from the computer vision domain
MISC	the factored optimistic initial model (foim) algorithm, maintains an empirical model of the fmdp in a conventional way, and always follows a greedy policy with respect to its model
MISC	the only trick of the algorithm is that the model is initialized optimistically
OWNX	to our best knowledge, foim is the first algorithm with these properties
OWNX	factored markov decision processes (fmdps) are practical ways to compactly formulate sequential decision problems---provided that we have ways to solve them
MISC	when the environment is unknown, all effective reinforcement learning methods apply some form of the ``optimism in the face of uncertainty'' principle: whenever the learning agent faces the unknown, it should assume high rewards in order to encourage exploration
MISC	factored optimistic initial model  (foim) takes this principle to the extreme: its model is initialized to be overly optimistic
MISC	for more often visited areas of the state space, the model gradually gets more realistic, inspiring the agent to head for unknown regions and explore them, in search of some imaginary ``garden of eden''
MISC	the algorithm is an extension of oim ( optimistic initial model )  citation , which is a sample-efficient learning algorithm for flat mdps
MISC	there is an important difference, however, in the way the model is solved
MISC	every time the model is updated, the corresponding value function needs to be re-calculated (or updated) for flat mdps, this is not a problem: various dynamic programming-based algorithms (like value iteration) can solve the model to any required accuracy in polynomial time
MISC	this planner is guaranteed to converge, and the error of its solution is bounded by a term depending only on the quality of function approximators
MISC	however, the listed proofs of convergence rely critically on access to a near-optimal planner, so they have to be generalized suitably
OWNX	we introduce basic concepts and notations in section , then in section  we review existing work, with special emphasis to the immediate ancestors of our method
OWNX	in sections  and  we describe the blocks of foim and the foim algorithm, respectively
MISC	to overcome this problem, another state of beliefs, called  near-ignorance , has been proposed
MISC	near-ignorance resembles ignorance very closely, by satisfying some principles that can arguably be regarded as necessary in a state of ignorance, and allows learning to take place
MISC	the key to this result is focusing on a setting characterized by a variable of interest that is  latent
MISC	this condition is shown to be easily satisfied even in the most common statistical problems
OWNX	we regard these results as a strong form of evidence against the possibility to adopt a condition of prior near-ignorance in real statistical problems
MISC	epistemic theories of statistics are often confronted with the question of  prior ignorance
MISC	yet, the subject would like to exploit the available sample to draw some statistical conclusion, i e , the subject would like to use the data to learn, moving away from the initial condition of ignorance
MISC	this situation is very important as it is often desirable to start a statistical analysis with weak assumptions about the problem of interest, thus trying to implement an objective-minded approach to statistics
MISC	a fundamental question is whether prior ignorance is compatible with learning or not
MISC	he shows, in a very general sense, that  vacuous  prior beliefs, i e , beliefs that a priori are maximally imprecise, lead to vacuous posterior beliefs, irrespective of the type and amount of observed data  citation
MISC	at the same time, he proposes focusing on a slightly different state of beliefs, called  near-ignorance , that does enable learning to take place  citation
OWNX	loosely speaking, near-ignorant beliefs are beliefs that are vacuous for a proper subset of the functions of the random variables under consideration (see section~)
MISC	in this way, a near-ignorance prior still gives one the possibility to express vacuous beliefs for some functions of interest, and at the same time it maintains the possibility to learn from data
MISC	the fact that learning is possible under prior near-ignorance is shown, for instance, in the special case of the  imprecise dirichlet model  (idm)  citation
MISC	this is a popular model, based on a near-ignorance set of priors, used in the case of inference from categorical data generated by a multinomial process
MISC	the interest in this investigation is motivated by the fact that near-ignorance sets of priors appear to play a crucially important role in the question of modeling prior ignorance about a categorical random variable
MISC	the key point is that near-ignorance sets of priors can be made to satisfy two principles: the  symmetry  and the  embedding principles
OWNX	the first is well known and is equivalent to laplace's  indifference principle ; the second states, loosely speaking, that if we are ignorant a priori, our prior beliefs on an event of interest should not depend on the space of possibilities in which the event is embedded (see section~ for a discussion about these two principles)
MISC	walley  citation , and later de cooman and miranda  citation , have argued extensively on the necessity of both the symmetry and the embedding principles in order to characterize a condition of ignorance about a categorical random variable
OWNX	our investigation starts by focusing on a setting where the categorical variable  symbol  under consideration is  latent
OWNX	variable  symbol  is assumed to be  manifest , in the sense that its realizations can be observed (see section~)
OWNX	using the introduced setup, we give a condition in section~, related to the likelihood function, that is shown to be sufficient to prevent learning about  symbol  under prior near-ignorance
OWNX	the condition is very general as it is developed for any set of priors that models near-ignorance (thus including the case of the idm), and for very general kinds of probabilistic relations between  symbol  and  symbol
MISC	in order to fully appreciate this result, it is important to realize that latent variables are ubiquitous in problems of uncertainty
MISC	doing this distinction makes sense because in practice an observational process is usually imperfect, i e , there is very often (it could be argued that there is always) a positive probability of confounding the realized value of  symbol  with another possible value committing thus an observation error
MISC	of course, if the probability of an observation error is very small and we consider one of the common bayesian model proposed to learn under prior ignorance, then there is little difference between the results provided by a latent variable model modeling correctly the observational process, and the results provided by a model where the observations are assumed to be perfect
MISC	for this reason, the observational process is often neglected in practice and the distinction between the latent variable and the manifest one is not enforced
MISC	as a consequence, when dealing with sets of probability distributions, neglecting the observational process may be no longer justified even if the probability of observation error is tiny
MISC	and the question is that these problematic distributions, which are usually not considered when dealing with bayesian models with a single prior, cannot be ruled out without dropping near-ignorance
MISC	as a consequence, it may make sense to consider re-focusing the research about this subject on developing models of very weak states of belief that are, however, stronger than near-ignorance
MISC	this might also involve dropping the idea that both the symmetry and the embedding principles can be realistically met in practice
MISC	engine assembly is a complex and heavily automated distributed-control process, with large amounts of faults data logged everyday
OWNX	we describe an application of temporal data mining for analyzing fault logs in an engine assembly plant
MISC	frequent episode discovery framework is a model-free method that can be used to deduce (temporal) correlations among events from the logs in an efficient manner
MISC	in addition to being theoretically elegant and computationally efficient, frequent episodes are also easy to interpret in the form actionable recommendations
MISC	incorporation of domain-specific information is critical to successful application of the method for analyzing fault logs in the manufacturing domain
OWNX	to the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first real, large-scale application of temporal data mining in the manufacturing domain
MISC	automotive engine assembly is a heavily automated and complex process that is  controlled in a distributed fashion
MISC	each assembly plant consists of several machines (or operations/stations) that are extensively inter-connected and are programmed to automatically execute the various operations necessary to manufacture an automotive engine
AIMX	in this paper, we present an application that uses temporal data mining techniques for analyzing these time-stamped logs to help in  fault analysis and root-cause diagnosis
MISC	the problem of multi--agent learning and adaptation has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years
MISC	it has been suggested that the dynamics of multi agent learning can be studied using replicator equations from population biology
MISC	most existing studies so far have been limited to discrete strategy spaces with a small number of available actions
MISC	in many cases, however, the choices available to agents are better characterized by continuous spectra
MISC	instead of probability vectors, agents' strategies are now characterized by probability measures over  continuous variables
MISC	the notion of autonomous agents that learn by interacting with the environment, and possibly with other agents, is a central concept in modern distributed ai~ citation
MISC	of particular interests are systems where multiple agents learn concurrently and independently by interacting with each other
MISC	this multi--agent learning problem has attracted a great deal of attention due to a number of important applications
MISC	among existing approaches,  multi--agent reinforcement learning (marl) algorithms have become increasingly popular due to their generality~ citation
MISC	although marl does not hold the same convergence guarantees as in single--agent case,  it has been shown to work well in practice (for a  recent survey, see~ citation )
MISC	from the analysis standpoint, marl represents a complex  dynamical system, where the learning trajectories of individual agents are coupled with each other via  a collective reward  mechanism
MISC	thus, it is desirable to know what are the possible long--term behaviors of those trajectories
MISC	specifically, one is usually interested whether, for a particular game structure, those trajectories converge to a    desirable steady state (called fixed points),    or oscillate indefinitely between many (possibly infinite) meta--stable states
MISC	in particular, it has been established that for  simple, stateless q--learning with a finite number of actions, the learning dynamics can be examined using the so called  replicator equations  from population biology~ citation
MISC	namely, if one associates a particular biological trait with each pure strategy, then the adaptive learning of (possibly mixed) strategies in multi--agent settings is analogous to   competitive dynamics of mixed population, where the species evolve according to their relative fitness in the population
MISC	this framework has been used successfully to study various interesting features of adaptive dynamics of learning agents~ citation
MISC	for instance, modeling an agent's bid in an auction with a continuous rather than discrete variable is more natural
MISC	in such situations, agents' strategies are represented as  probability density functions defined over a continuous set of actions
MISC	however, the rationale for using the continuous approximation is that it makes the dynamics more amenable to mathematical analysis
MISC	the agents use boltzmann action--selection mechanism that controls the exploration/exploitation tradeoff through a single temperature--like parameter
MISC	the reward functions for the agents are assumed to be functions of continuous variables instead of tensors, and the agent strategies are represented as probability distribution over those variables
MISC	the long--term behavior of those equations define the steady state, or equilibrium, profiles of the agent strategies
MISC	it is shown that, in general, the steady state strategy profiles of the replicator dynamics  do not correspond to the nash equilibria of the  game
MISC	this discrepancy can be attributed to the limited rationality of the agents due to exploration
OWNX	and example of such a game if provided in section~
OWNX	in section~ we introduce our model,  derive the replicator equations for the continuous strategy spaces, and a set of coupled non--linear functional equations that describe the steady state strategy profile
OWNX	in section~ we illustrate the framework on several examples of two--agent games, and  provide some detailed results for  general bi--linear and quadratic payoffs
MISC	motivated by the philosophy and phenomenal success of compressed sensing, the problem of reconstructing a matrix from a sampling of its entries has attracted much attention recently
MISC	such a problem can be viewed as an information--theoretic variant of the well--studied matrix completion problem, and the main objective is to design an  efficient  algorithm that can reconstruct a matrix by inspecting only a  small  number of its entries
MISC	although this is an impossible task in general, cand\`{e}s and co--authors have recently shown that under a so--called  incoherence  assumption, a rank  symbol   symbol  matrix can be reconstructed using semidefinite programming (sdp) after one inspects  symbol  of its entries
AIMX	in this paper we propose an alternative approach that is much more efficient and can reconstruct a larger class of matrices by inspecting a significantly smaller number of the entries
OWNX	specifically, we first introduce a class of so--called  stable  matrices and show that it includes all those that satisfy the incoherence assumption
OWNX	then, we propose a randomized basis pursuit (rbp) algorithm and show that it can reconstruct a stable rank  symbol   symbol  matrix after inspecting  symbol  of its entries
OWNX	perhaps more importantly, our algorithm will provide an  exact  reconstruction of the input matrix in polynomial time
MISC	by contrast, the sdp--based algorithm can only provide an  approximate  one in polynomial time
MISC	a fundamental problem that arises frequently in many disciplines is that of reconstructing a matrix with certain properties from some partial information
MISC	typically, such a problem is motivated by the desire to deduce global structure from a (small) number of local observations
MISC	for instance, consider the following applications:   {covariance estimation } in areas such as statistics, machine learning and wireless communications, it is often of interest to find the  maximum likelihood estimate  of the covariance matrix  symbol  of a random vector  symbol
MISC	such an estimate can be used to study the relationship among the variables in  symbol , or to give some indication on the performance of certain systems
MISC	usually, extra information is available to facilitate the estimation
OWNX	thus, the estimation problem becomes that of completing a partially specified matrix so that the completion satisfies the structural constraints and maximizes certain likelihood function {graph realization } it is a trivial matter to see that given the coordinates of  symbol  points in  symbol , the distance between any two points can be computed efficiently
MISC	however, the inverse problem --- given a subset of interpoint distances, find the coordinates of points (called a  realization ) in  symbol  (where  symbol  is fixed) that fit those distances --- turns out to be anything but trivial (see, eg ,  citation )
MISC	such a problem arises in many different contexts, such as sensor network localization (see, eg ,  citation ) and molecular conformation (see, e
MISC	g,  citation ), and is equivalent to the problem of completing a partially specified matrix to an  euclidean distance matrix  that has a certain rank (cf ~ citation ) {recovering structure from motion } a fundamental problem in computer vision is to reconstruct the structure of an object by analyzing its motion over time
MISC	this problem, which is known as the  structure from motion (sfm) problem  in the literature, can be formulated as that of finding a low--rank approximation to certain measurement matrix (see, eg ,  citation )
MISC	however, due to the presence of occlusion or tracking failures, the measurement matrix often has missing entries
MISC	to cope with this problem, various  recommendation systems  have been developed over the years (see, eg ,  citation )
MISC	roughly speaking, those systems maintain a matrix of preferences, where the rows correspond to users and columns correspond to items
MISC	naturally, if an user has not considered a particular item, then the corresponding entry of the matrix will remain unspecified
MISC	now, in order to predict users' preferences for the unseen items, one will have to complete a partially specified matrix so that the completion maximizes certain performance measure (such as each individual's utility  citation )
MISC	as a result, the reconstruction problem can be ill--posed (e g , there may not be a unique or even any solution that satisfies the given criteria)
MISC	this is indeed an important issue
OWNX	instead, we take a different approach and consider the information--theoretic aspects of the reconstruction problem
OWNX	specifically, let  symbol  be the rank  symbol  matrix that we wish to reconstruct
MISC	for the sake of simplicity, suppose that  symbol  is known
OWNX	initially,  no  information about  symbol  (other than its rank) is available
MISC	besides being a theoretical curiosity, such a problem does arise in practical applications
MISC	for instance, in the sensor network localization setting  citation , the aforementioned problem is tantamount to asking which of the pairwise distances are needed in order to guarantee a successful reconstruction of the network topology
MISC	it turns out that if the number of required pairwise distances is small, then we will be able to efficiently reconstruct the network topology by performing just a few distance measurements and solving a small semidefinite program (sdp)  citation
OWNX	to get an idea of what we should aim for, let us first determine the degrees of freedom available in specifying the rank  symbol  matrix  symbol
OWNX	this will give us a lower bound on the number of entries of  symbol  we need to inspect in order to guarantee an exact reconstruction
MISC	towards that end, consider the singular value decomposition (svd)  symbol , where  symbol  and  symbol  have orthonormal columns, and  symbol  is a diagonal matrix
MISC	clearly, there are  symbol  degrees of freedom in specifying  symbol
MISC	now, observe that for  symbol , the  symbol --th column of  symbol  must be orthogonal to all of the previous  symbol  columns, and that it must have unit length
MISC	thus, there are  symbol  degrees of freedom in specifying the  symbol --th column of  symbol , which implies that there are  symbol  degrees of freedom in specifying  symbol
MISC	by the same argument, there are  symbol  degrees of freedom in specifying  symbol
OWNX	hence, we have:  symbol  symbol a symbol symbol a symbol a symbol a symbol \theta(\delta) symbol a symbol nn symbol a=e_1e_1^t symbol e_1=(1,0,\ldots,0)\in\r^n symbol a symbol a symbol a symbol \theta(\delta) symbol a symbol a$
MISC	the notion of information distance is extended from pairs to multiples (finite lists)
OWNX	we study maximal overlap, metricity, universality,  minimal overlap, additivity, and normalized information distance in multiples
MISC	in pattern recognition, learning, and data mining one obtains information from objects containing information
MISC	this involves an objective definition of the information in a single object, the information to go from one object to another object in a pair of objects, the information to go from one object to any other object in a multiple of objects, and the shared information between objects,   citation
MISC	the classical notion of kolmogorov complexity  citation  is an objective measure  for the information in an  a  single  object, and information distance measures the information  between a  pair  of objects  citation
MISC	a variant of this compression distance has been tested on all time sequence databases used in the last decade in the major data mining conferences (sigkdd, sigmod, icdm, icde, ssdb, vldb, pkdd, pakdd)  citation
OWNX	the conclusion is that the method is competitive with all 51  other methods used and superior in  heterogenous data clustering and anomaly detection
MISC	this theory  has found many applications in pattern recognition, phylogeny, clustering, and classification
MISC	for objects that are represented as computer files such applications range from weather forecasting, software, earthquake prediction, music, literature, ocr, bioinformatics, to internet  citation
MISC	it discovers the `meaning' of words and phrases in the sense of producing a relative semantics
MISC	applications run from ontology, semantics, tourism on the web, taxonomy, multilingual questions, to question-answer systems   citation
MISC	for more references on either subject see the textbook  citation  or google scholar for references to  citation
OWNX	thus, we want to extend the information distance  measure from pairs to multiples
OWNX	we provide theory showing this new approach is consistent for models with long range structure, and apply the approach to motion capture and  high-dimensional video data, yielding results superior to standard alternatives
MISC	the method for predicting future events under such a dynamic model is to maintain a posterior distribution over the hidden state  symbol , based on all observations  symbol  up to time  symbol
MISC	the posterior can be updated using the formula:   the prediction of future events  symbol ,  symbol , conditioned on  symbol  is through the posterior over  symbol :  hidden state based dynamic models have a wide range of applications, such as time series forecasting, finance, control, robotics, video and speech processing
MISC	some detailed dynamic models and application examples can be found in  citation
MISC	from \eqref{eq:predict}, it is clear that the benefit of using a hidden state  dynamic model is that the information contained in the observation  symbol  can be captured by a relatively small hidden state  symbol
OWNX	therefore in order to predict the future, we do not have to use all previous observations  symbol  but only its state representation  symbol
MISC	there are reasonable algorithms that can learn these linear dynamic models
MISC	for example, in addition to the classical em approach, it was recently shown that global learning of certain hidden markov models can be achieved in polynomial time  citation
MISC	moreover, for linear models, the posterior update rule is quite  simple
MISC	therefore, once the model parameters are estimated, such models can be readily applied for prediction
MISC	however in many real problems, the system dynamics cannot be approximated linearly
MISC	for such problems, it is often necessary to  incorporate nonlinearity into the dynamic model
MISC	when the learned model is applied for prediction purposes, it is necessary to maintain the posterior  symbol  using the update formula in \eqref{eq:post-update}
MISC	unfortunately, for nonlinear systems, maintaining  symbol  is generally difficult because the posterior can become exponentially more complex (e g , exponentially many mixture components in a mixture model) as  symbol  increases
MISC	this computational difficulty is a significant obstacle to applying nonlinear dynamic systems to practical problems
MISC	the traditional approach to address the computational difficulty is through approximation methods
MISC	for example, in the particle filtering approach  citation , one uses a finite number of samples to represent the posterior distribution and the samples are then updated as observations arrive
MISC	although an exponential in  symbol  number of mixture components are needed to accurately represent the posterior, in practice, one has to use a fixed number of mixture components to approximate the distribution
MISC	this leads to the following question: even if the posterior can be well-approximated by a computationally tractable approximation family (such as finite mixtures of gaussians), how can one design a good approximate inference method that is guaranteed to find a good quality approximation
OWNX	it is shown that one can recover the underlying state representation by using prediction methods that are not necessarily probabilistic
MISC	compared to the traditional approach, it has several distinct advantages:   it does not require us to design any explicit state representation and probability model using prior knowledge
MISC	instead, the representation is implicitly embedded in the representational choice of the underlying supervised learning algorithm, which may be regarded as a black box with the power to learn an arbitrary representation
MISC	the prior knowledge can be simply encoded as input features to the learning algorithms, which significantly simplifies the modeling aspect
MISC	it does not require us to come up with any specific representation of the posterior and the corresponding approximate bayesian inference schemes for posterior updates
MISC	instead, this issue is addressed by incorporating the posterior update as part of the learning process
MISC	again, the posterior representation is implicitly embedded in the representational choice of the underlying supervised learning algorithm
OWNX	it is possible to obtain performance guarantees for our algorithm in terms of the learning performance of the underlying supervised algorithm
MISC	the performance of the latter has been heavily investigated in the statistical and learning theory literature
MISC	separating anomalous objects from well-known classes is an important step towards the discovery of new classes of astronomical objects
MISC	light-curve data precludes the use of these methods as the periods of any given pair of light-curves may be out of sync
OWNX	our method is able to scale to large data sets through the use of sampling
OWNX	we validate our method on both light-curve data and other time series data sets
OWNX	we demonstrate its effectiveness at finding known anomalies, and discuss the effect of sample size and number of centroids on our results
OWNX	we compare our method to naive solutions and existing time series anomaly detection methods for unphased data, and show that pcad's reported anomalies are comparable to or better than all other methods
OWNX	finally, astrophysicists on our team have verified that pcad finds true anomalies that might be indicative of novel astrophysical phenomena \keywords{anomaly detection time series data}
MISC	quasars  citation , radio pulsars  citation , and cosmic gamma-ray bursts  citation  were all discovered by alert scientists who, while examining data for a primary purpose, encountered aberrant phenomena whose further study led to these legendary discoveries
MISC	such discoveries were possible in an era when scientists had a close connection with their data
MISC	the advent of massive data sets renders unexpected discoveries through manual inspection improbable if not impossible
OWNX	our specific application is to find anomalies in sets of light-curves of periodic variable stars
MISC	there are over 350,000 cataloged variable stars with more being discovered
MISC	for  periodic  variable stars, the period of the star can be established
MISC	common types of periodic variable stars include cepheid, eclipsing binaries and rr lyrae, details of which can be found in  citation
MISC	the study of periodic variable stars is of great importance to astronomy
MISC	for example, the study of cepheids yielded the most valuable method for determining the hubble constant, and the study of binary stars enabled the discovery of a star's true mass
MISC	finding a new class or subclass of variable stars will be of tremendous value
OWNX	figure  shows a typical light-curve from each star class before and after we perform our pre-processing techniques (described in section )
MISC	the y-axis measures the magnitude of brightness of the star
MISC	magnitude is inversely proportional to the brightness of the observation, thus, the y-axis is plotted with descending values
MISC	the x-axis measures folded time
MISC	a folded light-curve is a light-curve where all periods are mapped onto a single period, which is why there may be multiple points on the y-axis for a single time point
OWNX	we describe light-curves and the process of folding in more detail in section  }  our research is motivated by the challenges inherent to performing anomaly detection on large sets of periodic variable light-curves
MISC	several of these challenges are common to many time series data sets
MISC	there are a large number of time-points in each light-curve (high dimensionality), low signal-to-noise ratio, and voluminous amounts of data
MISC	indeed, new surveys, such as the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system (pan-starrs), have the capacity to produce light-curves for billions of stars  citation
MISC	the middle panel shows the square of the correlation plotted as a function of the phase adjustment
OWNX	we define the optimal phase shift between two light-curves as the shift that yields the maximum similarity value
OWNX	this phasing problem presents a challenge to both general anomaly detection techniques, and those developed specifically for time series
OWNX	a general anomaly detection method, even with a metric that works for unphased data, may not work out of the box
OWNX	pcad is our solution to the problem of anomaly detection on large sets of unsynchronized periodic time series
MISC	pk-means differs from k-means in that it re-phases each time series prior to similarity calculation and updates centroids from these rephased curves
MISC	the pk-means subroutine runs offline on a sampling of the data
MISC	the online portion of pcad is the calculation of the anomaly score for each time series from the set of centroids produced offline by pk-means
MISC	this operation is linear in the size of the data set
MISC	another advantage of pcad is its flexibility to discover two types of anomalies: local and global
OWNX	we define the terms local and global anomaly and provide scoring methods for both
MISC	once each time series is assigned an anomaly score, pcad ranks the time series accordingly and outputs the top  symbol  for review
OWNX	to our knowledge, pcad is the only anomaly detection method developed specifically for unsynchronized time series data that can output both global and local outliers
OWNX	our paper presents empirical evidence on four data sets that pcad effectively finds known anomalies and produces a better ranking of anomalies when compared to naive solutions and other state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods for time series
OWNX	we discuss the effect of sample size and the parameter  symbol  (used by pk-means) on the anomaly detection results, and show experimental results on light-curve data with an unknown number of anomalies
OWNX	our paper concludes with an astrophysicists's discussion of the significance of the anomalies found by pcad
OWNX	as one might expect, the better our estimates of the label class distributions, the better the resulting classifier will be
OWNX	we give an inefficient but general-purpose smoothing method for converting an estimated distribution that is good under the  symbol  metric into a distribution that is good under the kl-divergence
OWNX	we consider a general approach to pattern classification in which elements of each class are first used to train a probabilistic model via some unsupervised learning method
MISC	the resulting models for each class are then used to assign discriminant scores to an unlabeled instance, and a label is chosen to be the one associated with the model giving the highest score
MISC	the natural discriminant score to assign to a string, is the probability that the hypothesis would generate that string at random
MISC	as one might expect, the better one's estimates of label class distributions (the class-conditional densities), the better should be the associated classifier
OWNX	we give bounds on the risk of the associated bayes classifier in terms of the quality of the estimated distributions
MISC	in~ citation  it has been shown how to learn a class of pdfas using kl-divergence, in time polynomial in a set of parameters that includes the expected length of strings output by the automaton
OWNX	we show here that this leads to a different---but still useful---performance guarantee for the bayes classifier
OWNX	abe and warmuth~ citation  study the problem of learning probability distributions using the kl-divergence, via classes of probabilistic automata
MISC	abe, takeuchi and warmuth~ citation  study the negative log-likelihood loss function in the context of learning  stochastic rules , i e ~rules that associate an element of the domain  symbol  to a probability distribution over the range  symbol
MISC	we show here that if two or more label class distributions are learnable in the sense of~ citation , then the resulting stochastic rule (the conditional distribution over  symbol  given  symbol ) is learnable in the sense of~ citation
OWNX	we also incorporate variable misclassification penalties (sometimes one might wish a false positive to cost more than a false negative), and show that this more general loss function is still approximately minimized provided that discriminant likelihood scores are rescaled appropriately
MISC	papers such as~ citation  study the problem of learning various classes of probability distributions with respect to kl-divergence and variation distance, in this setting
MISC	it is well-known (noted in~ citation ) that learnability with respect to kl-divergence is stronger than learnability with respect to variation distance
MISC	furthermore, the kl-divergence is usually used (for example in~ citation ) due to the property that when minimized with respect to an sample, the empirical likelihood of that sample is maximized
MISC	an algorithm that learns with respect to variation distance can sometimes be converted to one that learns with respect to kl-divergence by a smoothing technique~ citation , when the domain is  symbol , and  symbol  is a parameter of the learning problem
AIMX	in this paper we give a related smoothing rule that applies to the version of the pdfa learning problem where we seem to ``need'' to use the variation distance
MISC	however, the smoothed distribution does not have an efficient representation, and requires the probabilities used in the target pdfa to have limited precision
AIMX	this paper presents studies on a deterministic annealing algorithm based on quantum annealing for variational bayes (qavb) inference, which can be seen as an extension of the simulated annealing for variational bayes (savb) inference
MISC	qavb	is as easy as savb to implement
MISC	several studies that are related to machine learning with quantum mechanics have recently been conducted
MISC	citation  connects the basic probability rule of quantum mechanics, called the ``born rule'', which formulates a generalized probability by using a density matrix, to spectral clustering and other machine learning algorithms based on spectral theory

MISC	citation  proposed a quantum markov random field using a density matrix and quantum mechanics and applied to image restoration
MISC	warmuth et al generalized the bayes rule to treat a case where the prior was a density matrix  citation  and unified bayesian probability calculus for density matrices with rules for translation between joints and conditionals  citation
MISC	typically, the formulas derived by quantum mechanics generalization have retained the conventional theory as a special case when the density matrices have been diagonal
OWNX	computing the full posterior distributions over model parameters for probabilistic graphical models, eg latent dirichlet allocation  citation , remains difficult in these quantum bayesian frameworks, as well as classical bayesian frameworks
MISC	vb is an optimization algorithm that minimizes the cost function
MISC	the cost function, called the negative variational free energy, is a function of latent variables
MISC	since vb is a gradient algorithm similar to the expectation maximization (em) algorithm, it suffers from a local optimal problem in practice
MISC	deterministic annealing (da) algorithms have been proposed for the em algorithm  citation  and vb  citation  based on simulated annealing (sa)  citation  to overcome issue with local optima
OWNX	we called simulated annealing based vb savb
MISC	sa is one of the most well known physics based approaches to machine learning
MISC	sa is based on the concept of statistical mechanics, called ``temperature''
OWNX	because the energy landscape becomes flat at high temperature, it is easy to change the state (see fig (a))
OWNX	however, the state is trapped at low temperature because of the valley in the energy barrier and the transition probability becomes very low
MISC	therefore, sa does not necessarily find a global optimum in the practical cooling schedule of temperature  symbol
MISC	in physics, quantum annealing (qa) has attracted attention as an alternative annealing method of optimization problems by a process that is analogous to quantum fluctuations  citation
OWNX	we describe our motivation for deriving qavb in terms of a density matrix in section
OWNX	here, we overview the qavb that we derived
OWNX	interestingly, although qavb is generalized and formulated by a density matrix, the algorithm for qavb we finally derived does not need operations for a density matrix such as eigenvalue decomposition and only has simple changes from the savb algorithm
OWNX	here, let us consider running dependently, not independently, multiple savbs where ``dependently'' means that we run multiple savbs introducing interaction  symbol  among neighboring savbs that are randomly numbered such as  symbol ,  symbol  and  symbol  (see fig (b))
MISC	if there is a better state around sub-optimal states that the independent savbs find, the dependent savbs are expected to work well
OWNX	the dependent savbs are just qavb where interaction  symbol  and the above scheme are derived from qa mechanisms as will be explained in the following section
OWNX	in section , we motivate qavb in terms of a density matrix
OWNX	section  and  explain how we derive qavb and present the experimental results in latent dirichlet allocation (lda)
MISC	many learning machines that have hierarchical structure or hidden variables are now being used in information science, artificial intelligence, and bioinformatics
MISC	however, several learning machines used in such fields are not regular but  singular statistical models,  hence their generalization performance is still left unknown
MISC	to overcome these problems,  in the previous papers, we proved new equations in statistical learning,   by which we can estimate the bayes generalization loss from the bayes training loss and the functional variance, on the condition that the true distribution is a singularity contained in a learning machine
OWNX	also we prove that, the proposed equations in  a regular case are asymptotically equivalent to the takeuchi information criterion
MISC	nowadays, a lot of learning machines are being used in information science, artificial intelligence, and bioinformatics
MISC	however, several learning machines used in such fields, for example,  three-layer neural networks, hidden markov models, normal mixtures, binomial mixtures, boltzmann machines, and reduced rank regressions have hierarchical structure or hidden variables, with the result that the mapping from the parameter to the probability distribution is not one-to-one
MISC	in such learning machines, it was pointed out that  the maximum likelihood estimator is not subject to the normal distribution  citation ,  and that the  a posteriori  distribution can not be approximated by any gaussian distribution  citation
MISC	hence the conventional statistical  methods for model selection, hypothesis test, and hyperparameter optimization  are not applicable to such learning machines
OWNX	in statistical learning theory, we study the problem of learning and generalization based on several assumptions
MISC	let  symbol  be a true probability density function and   symbol  be a learning machine, which is represented by  a probability density function of  symbol  for a parameter  symbol
MISC	a true distribution  symbol  is said to be  parametrizable  by a learning machine  symbol ,  if there is a parameter  symbol  which satisfies  symbol
MISC	if  otherwise, it is called  nonparametrizable  \\ (2) the second is the regularity condition
MISC	a true distribution  symbol  is said to be  regular  for a learning machine  symbol ,  if the parameter  symbol  that minimizes the log loss function  symbol } is unique and if the hessian matrix  symbol  is positive definite
MISC	if a true distribution is not regular for a learning machine, then it is said to be   singular
MISC	in study of layered neural networks and normal mixtures,  both conditions are important
MISC	in fact,  if a learning machine is redundant compared to a true distribution, then the true distribution is parametrizable and singular
MISC	or if a learning machine is too simple to approximate a  true distribution, then the true distribution is nonparametrizable and  regular
OWNX	in practical applications, we need a method  to determine the optimal learning machine,  therefore, a general formula is desirable by which the generalization loss can be estimated from the training loss without regard to such conditions
MISC	since the new formulas hold for an arbitrary  set of a true distribution,  a learning machine, and an  a priori  distribution, they are called   equations of states in statistical estimation
MISC	however, it has not been clarified whether they hold or not  in a nonparametrizable case
OWNX	moreover, we show that, in  a nonparametrizable and regular case, the equations of states are asymptotically  equivalent to the takeuchi information criterion (tic)  for the maximum likelihood method
MISC	here tic was  derived for the model selection criterion in the case when the true distribution  is not contained in a statistical model  citation
MISC	the network information criterion  citation  was devised by generalizing it to an arbitrary loss function in the regular case
MISC	therefore, equations of states can be understood as the generalized version of tic from the maximum likelihood method in a regular case to bayes method for regular and singular cases
OWNX	in section 2, we summarized the framework of bayes learning and the results of previous papers
OWNX	in section 4, some lemmas are prepared  which are used in the proofs of the main results
OWNX	in section 5, we prove the main theorems
MISC	the problem of classifying sonar signals from rocks and mines first studied by gorman and sejnowski has become a benchmark against which many learning algorithms have been tested
OWNX	we discovered that both the training set and the test set of this benchmark are linearly separable, although with different hyperplanes
MISC	moreover, the complete set of learning and test patterns together, is also linearly separable
OWNX	we give the weights that separate these sets, which may be used to compare results found by other algorithms
MISC	it has become a current practice to test the performance of learning algorithms on \textsl{realistic} benchmark problems
MISC	the underlying difficulty of such tests is that in general these problems are not well caracterized, making it thus impossible to decide whether a better solution that the one already found exists
MISC	the sonar signals classification benchmark, introduced by gorman et al citation  is widely used to test machine learning algorithms
MISC	in this problem the classifier has to discriminate if a given sonar return was produced by a metal cylinder or by a cylindrically shaped rock in the same environment
MISC	the benchmark contains 208 preprocessed sonar spectra, defined by  symbol  real values, with their corresponding class
MISC	among these,  symbol  patterns are usually used to determine the classifier parameters through a procedure called learning
OWNX	we applied monoplane, a neural incremental learning algorithm, to this benchmark
MISC	in this algorithm, the hidden units are included one after the other until the number of training errors vanishes
MISC	each hidden unit is a simple binary perceptron, trained with the learning algorithm minimerror  citation
MISC	an approach to the acceleration of parametric weak classifier boosting is proposed
MISC	weak classifier is called parametric if it has fixed number of parameters and, so, can be represented as a point into multidimensional space
MISC	genetic algorithm is used instead of exhaustive search to learn parameters of such classifier
MISC	proposed approach also takes cases when effective algorithm for learning some of the classifier parameters exists into account
MISC	experiments confirm that such an approach can dramatically decrease classifier training time while keeping both training and test errors small
MISC	boosting is one of the commonly used classifier learning approaches
MISC	it is machine learning meta-algorithm that iteratively learns additive model consisting of weighed \term{weak} classifiers that belong to some classifier family  symbol
MISC	set  symbol  is referred to as \term{weak} classifier family
MISC	that is because it elements should have error rate only slightly better than random guessing
MISC	it expresses the key idea of boosting: strong classifier can be built on top of many weak
MISC	there are many boosting procedures that differ by the type of loss being optimized for the final classifier
MISC	but no matter what kind of boosting procedure is used, on each iteration it should select (learn) a weak classifier with minimal weighed loss from  symbol  family using special algorithm called \term{weak learner}
MISC	fast and accurate optimization methods are often not applicable there (especially in the case of discrete classifier parameters), so exhaustive search over weak classifier parameter space is used as a weak learner
MISC	unfortunately, exhaustive search can take a lot of time
MISC	that's why it is often very important to decrease weak classifier learning time using some appropriate numerical optimization approach
MISC	one of the widely used approaches to the numerical optimization is genetic algorithm  citation
MISC	it is based on biological evolution ideas
MISC	optimization problem solution is coded as \term{chromosome} vector \term{initial population} of solutions is created using random number generator \term{fitness function} is then used to assign fitness value to every population member
OWNX	solutions with the biggest fitness values are selected for the next step
MISC	that's how evolution is modeled
MISC	it continues until global or suboptimal solution is found or time allowed for evolution is over
MISC	it makes genetic algorithm good candidate for weak classifier learner
OWNX	before we can think of mechanizing this search for suitable mdps, we need a formal objective criterion
MISC	extensions to more realistic dynamic bayesian networks are developed in part ii  citation
MISC	the role of pomdps is also considered there
MISC	artificial general intelligence (agi) is concerned with designing agents that perform well in a wide range of environments  citation
MISC	among the well-established ``narrow'' artificial intelligence (ai) approaches  citation , arguably reinforcement learning (rl)  citation  pursues most directly the same goal
MISC	the agent's objective is to collect as much reward as possible
MISC	since the future is generally unknown and uncertain, the agent needs to learn a model of the environment based on past experience, which allows to predict future rewards and use this to maximize expected long-term reward
MISC	the simplest interesting environmental class consists of finite state fully observable markov decision processes (mdps)  citation , which is reasonably well understood
MISC	extensions to continuous states with (non)linear function approximation  citation , partial observability (pomdp)  citation , structured mdps (dbns)  citation , and others have been considered, but the algorithms are much more brittle
MISC	even if  potentially  useful representations have been found, it is usually not clear which ones will turn out to be better, except in situations where we already know a perfect model
MISC	think of a mobile robot equipped with a camera plunged into an unknown environment
OWNX	while we can imagine which image features will potentially be useful, we cannot know in advance which ones will actually be useful
AIMX	the primary goal of this paper is to develop and investigate a method that  automatically  selects those features that are necessary and sufficient for  reducing  a complex real-world problem to a computationally tractable mdp
OWNX	formally, we consider maps  symbol  from the past observation-reward-action history  symbol  of the agent to an mdp state
MISC	histories not worth being distinguished are mapped to the same state, i e \  symbol  induces a partition on the set of histories
OWNX	we call this model  symbol mdp
MISC	a state may be simply an abstract label of the partition, but more often is itself a structured object like a discrete vector
MISC	each vector component describes one feature of the history  citation
MISC	for example, the state may be a 3-vector containing (shape,color,size) of the object a robot tracks
OWNX	for this reason, we call the  reduction ,  feature rl , although in this part i only the simpler unstructured case is considered
MISC	symbol  maps the agent's experience over time into a sequence of mdp states
OWNX	rather than informally constructing  symbol  by hand, our goal is to develop a formal objective criterion  symbol  for  evaluating  different reductions  symbol
MISC	the ``cost'' of  symbol  shall be small iff it leads to a ``good'' mdp representation
MISC	another important question is which problems  can  profitably be reduced to mdps  citation
MISC	the real world does not conform itself to nice models: reality is a non-ergodic partially observable uncertain unknown environment in which acquiring experience can be expensive
MISC	so we should exploit the data (past experience) at hand as well as possible, cannot generate virtual samples since the model is not given (need to be learned itself), and there is no reset-option
MISC	of course, there is previous work which is in one or another way related to  symbol mdp
CONT	as partly detailed later, the suggested  symbol mdp model has interesting connections to many important ideas and approaches in rl and beyond: \parskip=0ex\parsep=0exsep=0ex   symbol mdp side-steps the open problem of learning pomdps  citation , %  unlike bayesian rl algorithms  citation ,  symbol mdp avoids learning a (complete stochastic) observation model, %   symbol mdp is a scaled-down practical instantiation of aixi  citation , %   symbol mdp extends the idea of state-aggregation from planning (based on bi-simulation metrics  citation ) to rl (based on information), %   symbol mdp generalizes u-tree  citation  to arbitrary features, %   symbol mdp extends model selection criteria to general rl problems  citation , %   symbol mdp is an alternative to psrs  citation  for which proper learning algorithms have yet to be developed, %   symbol mdp extends feature selection from supervised learning to rl  citation
MISC	learning in agents via rewards is a much more demanding task than ``classical'' machine learning on independently and identically distributed ( iid  ) data, largely due to the temporal credit assignment and exploration problem
MISC	nevertheless, rl (and the closely related adaptive control theory in engineering) has been applied (often unrivaled) to a variety of real-world problems, occasionally with stunning success (backgammon, checkers,  citation , helicopter control  citation )
MISC	symbol mdp owes its general-purpose  learning  and  planning  ability to its  information  and  complexity  theoretical foundations
MISC	given that  symbol mdp aims at general ai problems, one may wonder about the role of other aspects traditionally considered in ai  citation :  knowledge representation  (kr) and  logic  may be useful for representing complex reductions  symbol
MISC	agent interface fields like  robotics , computer  vision , and natural  language  processing can speedup learning by pre\&post-processing the raw observations and actions into more structured formats
OWNX	the following diagram illustrates  symbol mdp in perspective \end{center}   section  formalizes our  symbol mdp setup, which consists of the agent model with a map  symbol  from observation-reward-action histories to mdp states
OWNX	section  develops our core  symbol  selection principle, which is illustrated in section  on a tiny example
OWNX	section  discusses general search algorithms for finding (approximations of) the optimal  symbol , concretized for context tree mdps
OWNX	in section  i find the optimal action for  symbol mdp, and present the overall algorithm
OWNX	section  improves the  symbol  selection criterion by ``integrating'' out the states
MISC	throughout this article,  symbol  denotes the binary logarithm, %  symbol  the empty string, % and  symbol  if  symbol  and  symbol  else is the kronecker symbol
MISC	% i generally omit separating commas if no confusion arises, in particular in indices
MISC	%  symbol  denotes an estimate of  symbol
MISC	%  symbol  denotes a probability over states and rewards or parts thereof
MISC	i do not distinguish between random variables  symbol  and realizations  symbol , and abbreviation  symbol  never leads to confusion
MISC	more specifically,  symbol  denotes the number of states, %  symbol  any state index, %  symbol  the current time, % and  symbol  any time in history
MISC	% further, in order not to get distracted at several places i gloss over initial conditions or special cases where inessential
MISC	knn is one of the most popular classification methods, but it often fails to work well with inappropriate choice of distance metric or due to the presence of numerous class-irrelevant features
MISC	linear feature transformation methods have been widely applied to extract class-relevant information to improve knn classification, which is very limited in many applications
MISC	kernels have been used to learn powerful non-linear feature transformations, but these methods fail to scale to large datasets
MISC	knn is one of the most popular classification methods due to its simplicity and reasonable effectiveness: it doesn't require fitting a model and it has been shown to have good performance for classifying many types of data
OWNX	to classify high-dimensional data in real applications, we often need to learn or choose a good distance metric
MISC	in  citation , a global linear transformation is applied to the original feature space of data points to learn mahalanobis metrics, which requires all data points in the same class collapse to one point
MISC	making data points in the same class collapse to one point is unnecessary for knn classification
MISC	it may produce poor performance when data points cannot be essentially collapsed to points,  which is often true for some class containing multiple patterns
MISC	an information-theoretic based approach is used to learn linear transformations in  citation
MISC	in  citation , a global linear transformation is learned to directly improve knn classification to achieve the goal of a large margin
MISC	this method has been shown to yield significant improvement over knn classification, but the linear transformation often fails to give good performance in high-dimensional space and a pre-processing dimensionality reduction step by pca is often required for success
OWNX	in many situations, a linear transformation is not powerful enough to capture the underlying class-specific data manifold; thus we need to resort to more powerful non-linear transformations, so that each data point will stay closer to its nearest neighbors having the same class as itself than to any other data in the non-linearly transformed feature space
MISC	kernel tricks have been used to kernelize some of the above methods in order to improve knn classification  citation
MISC	however, the kernel-based approaches behave almost like template-based approaches
MISC	besides, kernel-based approaches often have difficulty in handling large datasets
OWNX	we might want to achieve non-linear mappings by learning a directed multi-layer belief net or a deep autoencoder, and then perform knn classification using the hidden distributed representations of the original input data
MISC	fortunately, recent research has shown that training a deep generative model called deep belief net is feasible by pretraining the deep net using a type of undirected graphical model called restricted boltzmann machine (rbm)  citation
MISC	rbms produce "complementary priors" to make the inference process in a deep belief net much easier, and the deep net can be trained greedily layer by layer using the simple and efficient learning rule of rbm
MISC	the greedy layerwise pretraining strategy has made learning models with deep architures possible  citation
MISC	besides, the idea of deep learning has motivated researchers to use powerful generative models with deep architectures to learn better discriminative models  citation
OWNX	it learns a non-linear feature transformation to directly achieve the goal of large-margin knn classification, which is based on a deep encoder network pretrained with rbms as shown in fig 2
MISC	our approach is mainly inspired by the work in  citation ,  citation  and  citation
MISC	given the labels of some or all training data, it allows us to learn a non-linear feature mapping to minimize the invasions to each data point's genuine neighborhood by other impostor nearest neighbors, which favours knn classification directly
MISC	previous researchers once used an autoencoder or a deep autoencoder for non-linear dimensionality reduction to improve knn  citation
OWNX	none of these approaches used an objective function as direct as what we use here for improving knn classification
MISC	the approach discussed in  citation  uses a convolution net to learn a similarity metric discriminatively, but it was handcrafted
OWNX	we applied dnet-knn on the usps and mnist handwritten digit datasets for classification
OWNX	the test error we obtained on the mnist benchmark dataset is  symbol , which is better than that obtained by deep belief net, deep autoencoder and svm  citation
MISC	these conclusions are consistent with the results of previous research trials on deep networks  citation
OWNX	in section 3, we describe previous work on rbm and training models with deep architectures
OWNX	in section 4, we present dnet-knn, which trains a deep encoder network for improving large-margin knn classification
OWNX	in section 5, we present our experimental results on the usps and mnist  citation  handwritten digit datasets
MISC	the problem arises in a variety of applications, from collaborative filtering (the `netflix problem') to structure-from-motion and positioning
OWNX	we study a low complexity algorithm introduced by  citation , based on a combination of spectral techniques and manifold optimization, that we call  here {optspace}
OWNX	we prove performance guarantees that are  order-optimal in a number of circumstances
MISC	a low-rank approximation of  symbol  can further be used for low-complexity implementations of a number of linear algebra algorithms  citation
MISC	it has   recently been discovered that, if the matrix  symbol  has rank  symbol , and unless it is too `structured', a small random subset of its  entries allow to reconstruct it  exactly
MISC	this result was first proved by  citation  by analyzing a convex relaxation introduced by  citation
MISC	a tighter analysis of the same convex relaxation was  carried out by  citation
MISC	a number of iterative schemes to solve the convex optimization problem appeared soon thereafter  citation
MISC	for many applications of interest, this assumption is unrealistic and it is therefore important to investigate their robustness
MISC	can the above approaches be generalized when the underlying data is `well approximated' by a rank  symbol  matrix
MISC	this question was addressed by  citation  within the convex relaxation approach of  citation
MISC	clusters of genes that have evolved by repeated segmental duplication present difficult challenges throughout genomic analysis, from sequence assembly to functional analysis
MISC	improved understanding of these clusters is of utmost importance, since they have been shown to be the source of evolutionary innovation, and have been linked to multiple diseases, including hiv and a variety of cancers
MISC	previously, zhang \etal~(2008)  developed an algorithm for reconstructing parsimonious evolutionary histories of such gene clusters, using only human genomic sequence data
OWNX	several projects are underway to obtain high quality bac-based assemblies of  duplicated clusters in multiple species, and we anticipate that our method  will be useful in analyzing these valuable new data sets
MISC	segmental duplications cover about 5\% of the human genome  citation
MISC	when multiple segmental duplications occur at a particular genomic locus they give rise to complex gene clusters
MISC	many important gene families  linked to various diseases, including cancers, alzheimer's disease, and hiv, reside  in such clusters
MISC	gene duplication is often followed by functional diversification  citation , and, indeed, genes overlapping segmental duplications have been shown to be enriched for positive selection  citation
OWNX	to demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, we apply our algorithm to simulated sequences on human-chimp-macaque phylogeny, as well as to real clusters assembled from available bac sequencing data
MISC	previously,   citation  studied the reconstruction of gene family histories by considering tandem duplications and inversions as the only possible events
MISC	they also assume that  genes are always copied as a whole unit
MISC	citation  demonstrated that  more complex models are needed to address evolution of gene clusters in the human genome
MISC	in more recent work, genes have been replaced by generic  atomic segments   citation  as the substrates of reconstruction algorithms
MISC	briefly, a self-alignment is constructed by a local alignment program (e g , blastz  citation ), and only alignments above certain threshold (e g , 93\% for human-macaque split) are kept
MISC	due to the  transitivity  of sequence similarity between atomic segments, the set of atomic segments can be decomposed into equivalence classes, or  atom types
OWNX	such a history also directly implies ``gene trees'' of individual atomic types, which we call  segment trees
MISC	these trees are implicitly rooted and reconciled with the species tree, and this information can be easily used to reconstruct ancestral sequences at speciation points segment by segment (see eg citation )
MISC	a common way of looking at these histories is from the most recent events back in time
OWNX	in this context, we can start from extant sequences, and  unwind  events one-by-one, until the ancestral sequence is reached
MISC	citation  sought solutions of this problems  with small number of events,  given the sequence from a single species
MISC	in particular, they proved a necessary condition to identify candidates for the latest duplication operation, assuming no reuse of breakpoints
MISC	after unwinding the latest duplication, the same step is repeated to identify the second latest duplication, etc
MISC	zhang \etal{} showed that following any sequence of  candidate duplications leads to a history with the same number of duplication events under no-breakpoint-reuse assumption
MISC	as a result, there may be an exponential number of most parsimonious solutions to the problem, and it may be impossible to reconstruct a unique history
MISC	a similar parsimony problem has also been recently explored by   citation  in the context of much larger sequences (whole genomes) and a broader set of operations (including inversions, translocations, etc )
MISC	both methods make use of fairly extensive heuristics to overcome violations of their assumptions and  allow their algorithms to be applied to real data
MISC	the no-breakpoint-reuse assumption is often justified by the argument that in long sequences, it is unlikely that the same breakpoint is used twice  citation
MISC	however, there is evidence that breakpoints do not occur uniformly throughout the sequence, and that breakpoint reuse is frequent  citation
MISC	moreover, breakpoints located close to each other may lead to short atoms that  can't be reliably identified by sequence similarity algorithms and categorized into atom types
OWNX	for example, in our simulated data (section ),  approximately 2\% of atoms are shorter than 20bp and may appear  as additional breakpoint reuses instead
MISC	thus, no-breakpoint-reuse can be a useful guide, but cannot be entirely relied on in application to real data sets
OWNX	we have also examined the assumption of correctness of segment trees  inferred from sequences of individual segments  (fig )
AIMX	for segments shorter than 500bp (39\% of all segments in our simulations)  69\% of the trees were incorrectly reconstructed, and even for segments 500-1,000bp long, a substantial fraction is incorrect (46\%) }  in this paper, we present a simple probabilistic model for sequence evolution by duplication, and we design a sampling algorithm that explicitly accounts for uncertainty in the estimation of segment trees and allows for breakpoint reuse
MISC	the results of  citation  suggest that, in spite of an improved model, there may still be many solutions of similar likelihood
MISC	the stochastic sampling approach allows us to examine such multiple solutions in the same framework and extract expectations for quantities of particular interest (e g , the expected number of events on individual branches of the phylogeny, or local properties of the ancestral sequences)
MISC	recent algorithms for gene tree reconstruction (e g ,  citation ) also consider genomic context of individual genes

MISC	the efficient marginalization of a multivariate function is important in many areas including signal processing, artificial intelligence, and digital communications
MISC	in fact, a number of well-known algorithms are special cases of sum-product message passing
MISC	the "sum" and the "product" in sum-product message passing may belong to an arbitrary commutative semiring  citation , citation
MISC	however,  emp  can also be used to compute expressions that appear in expectation maximization and in gradient ascent algorithms  citation - citation ; this connection appears to be new
OWNX	in section ii, we review sum-product message passing over a commutative semiring
OWNX	in section iii, we introduce the entropy semiring
OWNX	the  emp  algorithm is described in section iv and the mentioned applications are described in section v
AIMX	in this paper we introduce the class of stationary prediction strategies and construct a prediction algorithm that asymptotically performs as well as the best continuous stationary strategy
OWNX	we make mild compactness assumptions but no stochastic assumptions about the environment
OWNX	in section  we informally discuss the notion of stationarity, and section  concludes
MISC	%%%% replace with your abstract
MISC	traffic forecasting from past observed traffic data with small calculation complexity is one of important problems for planning of servers and networks
OWNX	under this model, we would show that the estimated forecasting value is obtained by simple arithmetic calculation and expresses real www traffic well from both theoretical and empirical points of view
MISC	under network environment such as internet, planning of servers and networks is one of important problems for stable operation
MISC	it is often typical situation that administrators analyze logs on their servers and networks
MISC	they may frequently look into result of log analysis software where these tools usually have some functions to periodically summarize logs
MISC	for example, webalizer  citation  and analog  citation  etc \, have been widely used among world wide web (www) server administrators or users for long years
MISC	these tools usually summarize the logs by counting hourly, daily, and monthly numbers of hits, files, and pages etc
MISC	administrators would often make their operation plans with combination of their experience and intuition from these logs
MISC	on the other hand, researchers in the field of traffic engineering have been suggesting a lot of analysis models
OWNX	probabilistic approach is one of viewpoints in this field
MISC	therefore desirable conditions of good traffic models are to have structures to express such nature at least
MISC	furthermore, another requirement of models is to have a structure of traffic forecasting
MISC	for this point, parameter estimation is often performed at first under assumption of the stationarity  citation , then the estimated parameter is substituted for the parameter of model
MISC	this approach has been wide-spread in the field of  inferential statistics  from the statistical point of view
MISC	however, substituting the estimated parameter as a constant for the model's parameter is not always suitable especially on forecasting problems
MISC	this is because there is often no guarantee that the assumptions under the parameter estimation of the model always hold for future unknown data set
MISC	bayesian approach  citation  citation  is one of alternatives for this point
MISC	in bayesian approach, a probability distribution of parameter is assumed as the prior distribution
MISC	recently, this approach has been widely applied to many forecasting problems especially in the field of information technologies and bioinformatics etc
MISC	in order to take bayesian approach,  statistical decision theory  is an important theoretical framework from the statistical point of view
MISC	bayesian forecasting on time varying parameter model has been proposed in  citation  by defining certain class of parameter transformation function
MISC	however, it has not yet been discussed about any predictive estimator nor definite transformation function of parameter  citation
MISC	another feature is that the traffic forecasting value is obtained by simple arithmetic calculations under known  symbol
MISC	in general, the bayes theorem often results in large calculation costs
MISC	however, certain combination of parameter distribution and its transformation function solves this problem
OWNX	we believe that this point can be helpful not only for theoretical calculation cost but also for real implementation on www log analysis tools  citation   citation
OWNX	section  gives some definitions and explanations of the forecasting model with time varying poisson distribution
OWNX	our first class of methods extends the bayesian t-test to include all parametric models in the exponential family and their conjugate priors
OWNX	our second class of methods uses dirichlet process mixtures (dpm) of such conjugate-exponential distributions as flexible nonparametric priors over the unknown distributions
OWNX	%on synthetic examples and real medical datasets, we show that our tests are competitive with the best state-of-the-art methods for this task, even outperforming them on average on the medical datasets
MISC	such tests are encountered in various disciplines from the life sciences to the social sciences:   in medical studies, one may want to find out if two classes of patients show different behaviour, response to a drug or susceptibility to a disease
MISC	in microarray analysis, one may compare measurements from different weeks, labs or platforms to find out if they follow the same distribution, before integrating them into one dataset, in order to increase sample size
MISC	in the neurosciences, one may want to compare measurements of brain signals under different external stimuli, to check whether brain activity is affected by these stimuli
MISC	in the social sciences, one may want to compare whether the behavior of a group of people, eg when they graduate, marry, or die, is different across countries or generations
MISC	in the financial sciences, one could for example compare the set of transactions performed at a stock exchange during different weeks, to find out if there is a change in activity in the financial markets
MISC	the only machine learning approach to this problem is a kernel method by  citation , using the means of the two samples  symbol  and  symbol  in a universal reproducing kernel hilbert space as its test statistics, but it has created lots of interest in that subject and follow-on studies~ citation
OWNX	here, we approach this two-sample problem from a bayesian perspective
MISC	the classic bayesian formulation of this problem would be in terms of a bayes factor~ citation  which represents the likelihood ratio that the data were generated according to hypothesis  symbol  (that is from the same distribution) or hypothesis  symbol  (that is from different distributions)
MISC	however, how to exactly define these two hypotheses is a crucial question, and many answers have been given in the bayesian literature with hypotheses that are tailored to a specific problem or application domain; one example are the bayesian t-tests used in microarray data analysis~ citation
OWNX	our goal in this paper is to define two general classes of two-sample tests that represent a precise formulation of the two-sample problem, but are not tailored to a specific application
OWNX	they are designed to offer an attractive middle ground between the general idea of using bayes factors and the specialised hypotheses testing problems studied in the literature
MISC	however, although the two-sample problem depends crucially on testing whether data come from one or two unknown distributions, bayesian approaches based on nonparametric density models have not been explored to date
OWNX	here we propose and explore such a non-parametric method using the classic dirichlet process mixture
MISC	this addresses a different but related question since it assumes a parametric null hypothesis
OWNX	we also define a parametric bayesian two-sample test where the model of the data is a member of the exponential family
MISC	this test generalizes the bayesian t-test by~ citation  and~ citation , who assume that the samples are gaussian
OWNX	in section~ we will review existing approaches to the two-sample problem on multivariate data, and highlight some differences between frequentist and bayesian hypothesis testing
OWNX	in section~ we outline the common core of our two bayesian two-sample test, before providing the details on the parametric test in section~ and on the non-parametric  test in section~
OWNX	%in section~ we will evaluate the performance of our tests, comparing it to the state-of-the-art methods in this field
MISC	two ubiquitous aspects of large-scale data analysis are that the data often
MISC	 have heavy-tailed properties and that diffusion-based or spectral-based
MISC	 methods are often used to identify and extract structure of interest
MISC	perhaps surprisingly, popular distribution-independent methods such as those
MISC	 settings
MISC	 the binary classification problem in these two popular settings
OWNX	in particular, we provide bounds on the sample complexity of maximum margin 
MISC	 classifiers when the magnitude of the entries in the feature vector decays
MISC	 according to a power law and also when learning is performed with the
MISC	 classifiers in a hilbert space
OWNX	we provide such a bound, and we demonstrate that our proof technique
MISC	 generalizes to the case when the margin is measured with respect to more
MISC	the latter result is of potential interest in cases where modeling the
MISC	 relationship between data elements as a dot product in a hilbert space is
MISC	 too restrictive
MISC	two ubiquitous aspects of large-scale data analysis are that the data often
MISC	 have heavy-tailed properties and that diffusion-based or spectral-based
MISC	 methods are often used to identify and extract structure of interest
MISC	in the absence of strong assumptions on the data, 
MISC	 dimension fail to provide nontrivial results for even simple learning
MISC	 problems such as binary classification in these two settings
MISC	at root, the reason is that in both of these situations the data are
MISC	 assumptions on the data) there may be a small number of ``very outlying''
MISC	 the maximum margin version of the binary classification problem in these 
MISC	 two popular settings
MISC	in both cases, 
OWNX	 we are able to obtain nearly optimal linear classification hyperplanes since
OWNX	 the distribution-dependent tools we employ are able to control the aggregate
OWNX	in particular, our results will hold even though the data may be 
MISC	 infinite-dimensional and unbounded
MISC	{dimension reduction; kernel methods; low-rank approximation; machine learning; nystr\"om extension}% in recent years, the spectral analysis of appropriately defined kernel matrices has emerged as a principled way to extract the low-dimensional structure often prevalent in high-dimensional data
OWNX	here we provide an introduction to spectral methods for linear and nonlinear dimension reduction, emphasizing ways to overcome the computational limitations currently faced by practitioners with massive datasets
MISC	in particular, a data subsampling or landmark selection process is often employed to construct a kernel based on partial information, followed by an approximate spectral analysis termed the nystr\"om extension
OWNX	we provide a quantitative framework to analyse this procedure, and use it to demonstrate algorithmic performance bounds on a range of practical approaches designed to optimize the landmark selection process
OWNX	we compare the practical implications of these bounds by way of real-world examples drawn from the field of computer vision, whereby low-dimensional manifold structure is shown to emerge from high-dimensional video data streams
MISC	in recent years, dramatic increases in available computational power and data storage capabilities have spurred a renewed interest in dimension reduction methods
MISC	this trend is illustrated by the development over the past decade of several new algorithms designed to treat nonlinear structure in data, such as isomap (tenenbaum  et al ~2000), spectral clustering (shi \&~malik~2000), laplacian eigenmaps (belkin \&~niyogi~2003), hessian eigenmaps (donoho \&~grimes~2003) and diffusion maps (coifman  et al ~2005)
MISC	in fact, spectral methods and their brethren have long held a central place in statistical data analysis
OWNX	accordingly, if we write  symbol  for the requisite complexity of an exact eigendecomposition, large and/or high-dimensional datasets can pose severe computational problems for both classical and modern methods alike
OWNX	one alternative is to construct a kernel based on partial information; that is, to analyse directly a set of `landmark' dimensions or examples that have been selected from the dataset as a kind of summary statistic
MISC	landmark selection thus reduces the overall computational burden by enabling practitioners to apply the aforementioned algorithms directly to a subset of their original data---one consisting solely of the chosen landmarks---and subsequently to extrapolate their results at a computational cost of  symbol
OWNX	we begin with a review of linear and nonlinear dimension-reduction methods in~\s, and formally introduce the optimal landmark selection problem in~\s
OWNX	we then provide an analysis framework for landmark selection in~\s, which in turn yields a clear set of trade-offs between computational complexity and quality of approximation
OWNX	finally, we conclude in~with a case study demonstrating applications to the field of computer vision
OWNX	we describe an adaptation and application of a search-based structured prediction algorithm ``\searn'' to unsupervised learning problems
OWNX	we additionally show a close connection between unsupervised \searn\ and expectation maximization
OWNX	finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of a semi-supervised extension
MISC	a prevalent and useful version of unsupervised learning arises when both the observed data and the latent variables are structured
MISC	examples range from hidden alignment variables in speech recognition  citation  and machine translation  citation , to latent trees in unsupervised parsing  citation , and to pose estimation in computer vision  citation
OWNX	these techniques are all based on probabilistic models
MISC	their applicability hinges on the tractability of (approximately) computing latent variable expectations, thus enabling the use of em  citation
OWNX	we show: (1) that under an appropriate construction, \searn\ can imitate the expectation maximization (section~); (2) that unsupervised \searn\ can be used to obtain competitive performance on an unsupervised dependency parsing task (section~); and (3) that unsupervised \searn\ naturally extends to a semi-supervised setting (section~)
OWNX	the key insight that enables this work is that we can consider the prediction of the (observed) input to be, itself, a structured prediction problem
OWNX	we learn multiple hypotheses for related tasks under a latent hierarchical relationship between tasks
OWNX	we exploit the intuition that for  domain adaptation , we wish to share classifier structure, but for  multitask learning , we wish to share covariance structure
OWNX	our hierarchical model is seen to subsume several previously proposed multitask learning models and performs well on three distinct real-world data sets
OWNX	we consider two related, but distinct tasks: domain adaptation (da)  citation  and multitask learning (mtl)  citation
OWNX	in mtl, we learn multiple classifiers for solving  different problems  over data from the  same distribution
MISC	seen from a bayesian perspective, a natural solution is a hierarchical model, with hypotheses as leaves  citation
MISC	however, when there are more than two hypotheses to be learned (i e , more than two domains or more than two tasks), an immediate question is: are all hypotheses equally related
MISC	if not, what is their relationship
OWNX	we treat the hierarchy nonparametrically, employing kingman's coalescent  citation
OWNX	we derive an em algorithm that makes use of recently developed efficient inference algorithms for the coalescent  citation
OWNX	on several da and mtl problems, we show the efficacy of our model
OWNX	our models for da and mtl share a common structure based on an unknown hierarchy
MISC	the key difference between the da model and the mtl model is in what information is shared across the hierarchy
OWNX	for simplicity, we consider the case of linear classifiers (logistic regression and linear regression)
MISC	this can be extended to non-linear classifiers by moving to gaussian processes  citation
MISC	in domain adaption, a useful model is to assume that there is a single classifier that ``does well'' on all domains  citation
OWNX	in the context of hierarchical bayesian modeling, we interpret this as saying that the weight vector associated with the linear classifier is generated according to the hierarchical structure
MISC	on the other hand, in mtl, one does  not  expect the same weight vector to do well for all problems
MISC	instead, a common assumption is that features co-vary in similar ways between tasks  citation
OWNX	in a hierarchical bayesian model, we interpret this as saying that the covariance structure associated with the linear classifiers is generated according to the hierarchical structure
OWNX	in brief: for da, we share weights; for mtl, we share covariance
OWNX	we present an algorithmic framework for learning multiple related tasks
OWNX	our framework exploits a form of prior knowledge that relates the output spaces of these tasks
OWNX	we present results on learning a shallow parser and named-entity recognition system that exploits our framework, showing consistent improvements over baseline methods
MISC	the key idea is to perform self-training  only  on outputs that obey the constraints
OWNX	our motivating example in this paper is the task pair: named entity recognition (ner) and shallow parsing (aka syntactic chunking)
MISC	consider a hidden sentence with known pos and syntactic structure below
OWNX	further consider four potential ner sequences for this sentence \end{small}   without ever seeing the actual sentence, can we guess which ner sequence is correct
MISC	ner4 has none of these problems and seems quite reasonable
OWNX	there are similarities between our proposed model and both self-training and co-training; background is given in section~
OWNX	we present a formal model for our approach and perform a simple, yet informative, analysis (section~)
OWNX	finally, we present full-blown results on seven different ner data sets (one from conll, six from ace), comparing our method to several competitive baselines (section~)
MISC	moreover, \searn\ comes with a strong, natural theoretical guarantee: good performance on the derived classification problems implies good performance on the structured prediction problem
MISC	prediction is the task of learning a function  symbol  that maps inputs  symbol  in an input domain  symbol  to outputs  symbol  in an output domain  symbol
MISC	standard algorithms---support vector machines, decision trees, neural networks, etc
MISC	the simplest and best studied such output domain is that of labeled sequences
MISC	the structured complexity of features and loss functions in these problems significantly exceeds that of sequence labeling problems
MISC	however, to give a flavor, the popular conditional random field algorithm  citation  is viewed along these dimensions as follows
MISC	structure: inference for a crf is tractable for any graphical model with bounded tree width; loss: the crf typically optimizes a log-loss approximation to 0/1 loss over the entire structure; features: any feature of the input is possible but only output features that obey the graphical model structure are allowed; data: em can cope with hidden variables
MISC	somewhat surprisingly, \searn\ meets nearly all of these requirements by transforming structured prediction problems into binary prediction problems to which a vanilla binary classifier can be applied \searn\ comes with a strong theoretical guarantee: good binary classification performance implies good structured prediction performance
MISC	simple applications of \searn\ to standard structured prediction problems yield tractable state-of-the-art performance

OWNX	our clustering model is based on the dirichlet process prior, which enables us to define distributions over the countably infinite sets that naturally arise in this problem
OWNX	we add  supervision  to our model by positing the existence of a set of unobserved random variables (we call these ``reference types'') that are generic across all clusters
OWNX	inference in our framework, which requires integrating over infinitely many parameters, is solved using markov chain monte carlo techniques
OWNX	we present algorithms for both conjugate and non-conjugate priors
OWNX	we present a simple---but general---parameterization of our model based on a gaussian assumption
OWNX	we evaluate this model on one artificial task and three real-world tasks, comparing it against both unsupervised and state-of-the-art supervised algorithms
OWNX	our results show that our model is able to outperform other models across a variety of tasks and performance metrics
MISC	these training examples enable a learning algorithm to determine what aspects of  symbol  are relevant to creating an appropriate clustering
MISC	the  symbol  training examples  symbol  are subsets of  symbol  paired with their correct partitioning
MISC	in the end, the supervised clustering task is a prediction problem: a new  symbol  is presented and a system must produce a partition of it
MISC	in the database community, the task arises in the context of merging databases with overlapping fields, and is known as  record linkage   citation
MISC	in information extraction, particularly in the context of extracting citations from scholarly publications, the task is to identify which citations are to the same publication

MISC	in the machine learning community, it has additionally been referred to as  learning under equivalence constraints   citation  and  learning from cluster examples   citation
MISC	this prior plays two crucial roles: first, it allows us to estimate the number of clusters  symbol  in a principled manner; second, it allows us to control the complexity of the solutions that are learned
OWNX	we present inference methods for our model based on markov chain monte carlo methods

MISC	   in recent years analysis of complexity of learning gaussian mixture models from sampled data has received
MISC	 significant attention in computational machine learning and theory communities
MISC	 possible when the separation between the component means is arbitrarily small
OWNX	specifically, we present an algorithm for learning the parameters of a mixture of  symbol  identical
MISC	 spherical gaussians in  symbol -dimensional space with an arbitrarily small separation between the components, which is
MISC	 parameters for a  fixed  number of components  symbol
MISC	to produce the necessary lower bound  for the  symbol  norm in terms of the
OWNX	 distances between the corresponding means, we analyze the behavior of the fourier transform
MISC	 of a mixture of gaussians  in one dimension around the origin, which turns out to be closely related
MISC	 to the properties of the vandermonde matrix obtained from the component means
MISC	analysis of  minors of the
MISC	 vandermonde matrix  together with basic
MISC	 function approximation results allows us to provide a  lower bound for the norm  of the
MISC	 mixture in the  fourier domain and hence a bound in the original space
OWNX	additionally, we present a separate argument
MISC	mixture models, particularly gaussian mixture models, are a widely used tool for many problems of statistical inference  citation
MISC	the basic problem  is to estimate the parameters of a mixture distribution, such as the mixing
MISC	 some pre-specified precision from a number of sampled data points
MISC	while the history of gaussian mixture models goes back to~ citation , in recent years the theoretical aspects  of mixture learning have attracted considerable attention  in
OWNX	 the theoretical computer science, starting
MISC	 with the pioneering work of~ citation , who showed that a mixture of  symbol  spherical
MISC	 gaussians in  symbol  dimensions can be learned in time polynomial in  symbol ,
MISC	this work has been refined and
MISC	 extended in a number of recent papers
MISC	 in~ citation  for spherical gaussians and in~ citation  for general gaussians
MISC	the separation requirement was
MISC	 further reduced and made independent of  symbol  to the order of  symbol  in  citation  for spherical
MISC	 gaussians and to the order of  symbol  in~ citation  for logconcave distributions
MISC	in a related work~ citation  the separation requirement was reduced to  symbol
MISC	an extension of pca
MISC	 called isotropic pca  was introduced in  citation   to learn mixtures of gaussians when any pair of
MISC	 mixture of gaussian distributions with arbitrary separation between the means
MISC	the authors used
MISC	 to a construct a hypothesis mixture of
MISC	 gaussians that has density close to the actual mixture generating the data
OWNX	we note that the problem analyzed in~ citation  can be viewed as
MISC	 density estimation within a certain family of distributions and is different from most other work on the
OWNX	 subject, including our paper, which address parameter learning
MISC	 and heavy tailed distributions
MISC	see for example,  citation
MISC	in the statistics literature,  citation  showed that optimal convergence rate of mle estimator for finite mixture of normal distributions is  symbol , where  symbol  is the sample size, if number of mixing components  symbol  is known in advance and is  symbol  when the number of mixing components is known up to an upper bound
MISC	 the  mixture of  symbol  identical spherical gaussians with potentially unknown variance for an arbitrarily small separation 
MISC	 between the components
OWNX	to the best of our knowledge this is the
OWNX	we note that the results in~ citation  
OWNX	 and in our paper are somewhat orthogonal
OWNX	 and  symbol  identical spherical gaussians with unknown variance in our case), which is to show polynomial learnability for 
MISC	 a mixture with an arbitrary number of components and arbitrary variance
MISC	all other existing algorithms for parameter estimation require minimum separation between the components to be  
MISC	 an increasing function of at least one of  symbol  or  symbol
OWNX	our result also implies a density estimate bound
MISC	 along the lines of~ citation
MISC	 super-exponential in  symbol
MISC	 fundamental problem of polynomial learnability of gaussian mixture distributions
OWNX	the main algorithm in our paper involves a grid search over a certain space of parameters, specifically means
MISC	 and mixing coefficients of the mixture (a completely separate argument is given to estimate the variance)
OWNX	to prove that, we need to provide a lower and upper bounds on the norm of the mixture
OWNX	a key point of our paper

MISC	in general, we consider an unknown distribution  symbol   and the goal is to find a good approximation given a finite sample of words independently drawn from  symbol
MISC	this class has the same expressiveness as hidden markov models and is identifiable in the limit~ citation
MISC	however, there exists no efficient algorithm for identifying pa
MISC	these models admit a canonical representation which offers good opportunities from a machine learning point of view
MISC	ma define functions that compute rational series with values in  symbol ~ citation
MISC	with  symbol  or  symbol ,  symbol  is exactly the class of stochastic languages generated by pa with parameters in  symbol
OWNX	but, when  symbol  or  symbol , we obtain strictly greater classes
MISC	however, the class  symbol  presents a serious drawback: there exists no recursively enumerable subset class of ma which exactly generates it~ citation
MISC	as a consequence, no proper identification algorithm can exist: indeed, applying a proper identification algorithm to an enumeration of samples of  symbol  would provide an enumeration of the class of rational stochastic languages over  symbol
MISC	but before reaching the target, dees can produce ma that do not define stochastic languages
MISC	however, it has been shown in~ citation  that with probability one, for any rational stochastic language  symbol , if dees is given as input a sufficiently large sample  symbol  drawn according to  symbol , dees outputs a rational series such that  symbol  converges absolutely to 1
MISC	moreover,  symbol  converges to 0 as the size of  symbol  increases
OWNX	we show that these ma belong to a broader class of rational series, that we call  pseudo-stochastic rational languages
MISC	a pseudo-stochastic rational language  symbol  has the property that  symbol  is defined for any word  symbol  and that  symbol
MISC	a stochastic language  symbol  can be associated with  symbol  in such a way that  symbol  when the sum  symbol  is absolutely convergent

MISC	as a second consequence, for any rational stochastic language  symbol , if dees is given as input increasing samples drawn according to  symbol , dees outputs pseudo-stochastic rational languages  symbol  such that  symbol  converges to 0 as the size of  symbol  increases
OWNX	we show that the class of pseudo-stochastic rational languages is decidable within polynomial time
OWNX	we provide an algorithm that can be used to compute  symbol  from any ma that computes  symbol
OWNX	we show that there exist pseudo-stochastic rational languages  symbol  such that  symbol  is not rational
OWNX	finally, we show that it is undecidable whether two pseudo-stochastic rational languages define the same stochastic language
OWNX	we have carried out a lot of experiments which show that dees outperforms alergia and mdi in most cases
MISC	these results were expected since alergia and mdi have not the same theoretical expressiveness and since dees aims at producing a minimal representation of the target in the set of ma, which can be significantly smaller than the smaller equivalent pda (if it exists)

OWNX	section 3 deals with our study of pseudo-rational stochastic languages
OWNX	our experiments are detailed in section 4
MISC	unfortunately, their flexibility comes at a cost: inference in dp mixture models is computationally expensive, even when conjugate distributions are used
OWNX	in the common case when one seeks only a maximum a posteriori assignment of data points to clusters, we show that search algorithms provide a practical alternative to expensive mcmc and variational techniques
MISC	experimental results show that using these techniques is it possible to apply dp mixture models to very large data sets
MISC	their flexibility derives from the fact that one need not specify a number of mixture components a priori
MISC	in practice, dp mixture models have been used for problems in genomics  citation , relational learning  citation , data mining  citation  and vision  citation
MISC	despite these successes, the flexibility of dp mixture models comes at a high computational cost
OWNX	variational techniques  citation  are an attractive alternative, but are difficult to implement and can remain slow
OWNX	like variational approaches to dp mixture models, we focus on conjugate distributions from the exponential family
OWNX	unlike mcmc techniques, which can produce samples of cluster assignments from the corresponding posterior, our search-based techniques will only find an approximate map cluster assignment
OWNX	we do not believe this to be a strong limitation: in practice, the applications cited above all use mcmc techniques to draw a sample and then simply choose from this sample the single assignment with the highest posterior probability
OWNX	if one needs samples from the posterior, then the solution found by our methods could initialize mcmc
OWNX	we present \bayesum\ (for ``bayesian summarization''), a model for sentence extraction in query-focused summarization \bayesum\ leverages the common case in which multiple documents are relevant to a single query
MISC	using these documents as reinforcement for query terms, \bayesum\ is not afflicted by the paucity of information in short queries
OWNX	furthermore, we show how \bayesum\ can be understood as a justified query expansion technique in the language modeling for ir framework
MISC	we describe \bayesum, an algorithm for performing query-focused summarization in the common case that there are many relevant documents for a given query
OWNX	given a query and a collection of relevant documents, our algorithm functions by asking itself the following question: what is it about these relevant documents that differentiates them from the  non- relevant documents \bayesum\ can be seen as providing a statistical formulation of this exact question
MISC	the key requirement of \bayesum\ is that multiple relevant documents are known for the query in question
MISC	this is not a severe limitation
MISC	similarly, in the case of a web-search application, an underlying ir engine will retrieve multiple (presumably) relevant documents for a given query
MISC	for both of these tasks, \bayesum\ performs well, even when the underlying retrieval model is noisy
MISC	the idea of leveraging known relevant documents is known as query expansion in the information retrieval community, where it has been shown to be successful in ad hoc retrieval tasks
OWNX	viewed from the perspective of ir, our work can be interpreted in two ways
MISC	first, it can be seen as an  application  of query expansion to the summarization task (or, in ir terminology, passage retrieval); see  citation
MISC	second, and more importantly, it can be seen as a method for query expansion in a non-ad-hoc manner
MISC	that is, \bayesum\ is a statistically justified query expansion method in the language modeling for ir framework  citation
OWNX	we describe an approach to domain adaptation that is appropriate exactly in the case when one has enough ``target'' data to do slightly better than just using only ``source'' data
OWNX	our approach is incredibly simple, easy to implement as a preprocessing step (10 lines of perl ) and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on a range of datasets
MISC	moreover, it is trivially extended to a multi-domain adaptation problem, where one has data from a variety of different domains
MISC	the task of domain adaptation is to develop learning algorithms that can be easily ported from one domain to another---say, from newswire to biomedical documents
AIMX	the approach we present in this paper is based on the idea of transforming the domain adaptation learning problem into a standard supervised learning problem to which any standard algorithm may be applied (eg , maxent, svms, etc )
OWNX	our transformation is incredibly simple: we augment the feature space of both the source and target data and use the result as input to a standard learning algorithm
MISC	there are roughly two varieties of the domain adaptation problem that have been addressed in the literature: the fully supervised case and the semi-supervised case
OWNX	we want to leverage both annotated datasets to obtain a model that performs well on the target domain
OWNX	the semi-supervised case is similar, but instead of having a small annotated target corpus, we have a large but  unannotated  target corpus
MISC	name/easyadapt
OWNX	in addition to this simplicity, our algorithm performs as well as (or, in some cases, better than) current state of the art techniques
OWNX	we consider a class of fully stochastic and fully distributed algorithms, that we prove to learn equilibria in games
OWNX	indeed, we consider a family of stochastic distributed dynamics that we prove to converge weakly (in the sense of weak convergence for probabilistic processes) towards their mean-field limit, i
OWNX	we focus then on a class of stochastic dynamics where this ode turns out to be related to multipopulation replicator dynamics
MISC	% , well-known and studied in evolutionary game theory
OWNX	for games admitting lyapunov functions, that we call lyapunov games, the stochastic dynamics converge
OWNX	we prove that any ordinal potential game, and hence any potential game is a lyapunov game, with a multiaffine lyapunov function
OWNX	for lyapunov games with a multiaffine lyapunov function, we prove that this lyapunov function is a super-martingale over the stochastic dynamics
MISC	consider a scenario where agents learn from their experiments, by small adjustments
MISC	this might  be  for example about choosing their telephone companies, or about their portfolio investments
OWNX	%, that we will assume to be rational
MISC	% assume that agents are rational
MISC	% we also want to avoid dynamics that would suppose a global knowledge of the market, that is to say we   several such dynamics of adjustments have been considered recently in the algorithmic game theory literature
MISC	stochastic variations, avoiding a global description, have been considered
MISC	however, considered dynamics are somehow rather ad-hoc, in order to get efficient convergence time bounds, and still mainly best-response based
OWNX	we want to consider here more general dynamics, and discuss when one may expect convergence
MISC	this could lead to consider any dynamics  which is monotone with respect to the utility of players, in relation with evolutionary game theory literature  citation
OWNX	we propose to restrict here to dynamics that lead to dynamics related to (possibly perturbed) replicator dynamics
MISC	basic game theory framework
MISC	let  symbol  be the set of players
MISC	every player  symbol  has a set  symbol  of  pure strategies
MISC	let  symbol  be the cardinal of  symbol
MISC	a  mixed strategy   symbol  corresponds to a probability distribution over pure strategies: pure strategy  symbol  is chosen with probability  symbol , with  symbol
MISC	let  symbol  be the simplex of mixed strategies for player  symbol
MISC	any pure strategy  symbol  can be considered as mixed strategy  symbol , where vector  symbol  denotes the unit probability vector  with  symbol  component unity, hence as a corner of  symbol
MISC	let  symbol  be the space of all mixed strategies
MISC	a  strategy profile   symbol  specifies the (mixed or pure) strategies of all players:  symbol  corresponds to the mixed strategy played by player  symbol
MISC	in particular, the expected cost for player  symbol   for playing pure strategy  symbol   is denoted by  symbol
MISC	some classes of games
MISC	in  load balancing games   citation , resources are called machines, and players compete for elements (i e singleton subsets) of  symbol
MISC	hence, the pure strategy space  symbol  of player  symbol  having a weight  symbol  corresponds to  symbol  or a subset of  symbol , and a pure strategy  symbol  for player  symbol  is some element  symbol
MISC	the cost for player (task)  symbol   under profile of pure strategies (assignment)  symbol   corresponds to  symbol , where  symbol  is the load of machine  symbol :   symbol , that is to say %  defined as  the sum of the weights of the tasks running on it
MISC	in  congestion games   citation , resources are called edges, and players compete for subsets of  symbol
MISC	the cost of player  symbol  under  profile of pure strategies  symbol  corresponds to  symbol  where  symbol  is the number of % players  that use resource  symbol  in  symbol , that is to say the number of  symbol  with  symbol
MISC	in  weighted congestion games , weights  symbol  are associated to players, and one takes instead  symbol
MISC	in  task allocation games   citation ,  as in load balancing games, resources are called machines, and players compete for elements (i e singleton subsets) of  symbol
MISC	the cost of player  symbol  under  profile of pure strategies  symbol  is then given by  symbol
MISC	functions  symbol  can be considered as speed and scheduling policies, and associated costs as corresponding completion time for player (task)  symbol
MISC	for example, spt and lpt are policies that schedule the jobs without preemption respectively in order of increasing or decreasing weights (processing times)  citation
MISC	clearly, load balancing games are particular task allocation games, and load balancing games are particular weighted congestion games
MISC	a load balancing game whose weights are unitary is a particular congestion game
MISC	ordinal and potential games
MISC	all these classes of games can be related to ordinal and potential games introduced by  citation :  a game is an  ordinal potential game  if there exists some function  symbol  from  pure  strategies to  symbol  such that for all pure strategies  symbol ,  symbol , and  symbol , one has   symbol
MISC	principal component analysis (pca) is a widely used technique for data  analysis and dimension reduction with numerous applications in science  and engineering
MISC	however, the standard pca suffers from the fact  that the principal components (pcs) are usually linear combinations  of all the original variables, and it is thus often difficult to  interpret the pcs
MISC	to alleviate this drawback, various sparse  pca approaches were proposed in literature  citation
MISC	despite success in achieving sparsity, some important properties  enjoyed by the standard pca are lost in these methods such as  uncorrelation of pcs and orthogonality of loading vectors
OWNX	we also develop a novel augmented  lagrangian method for solving a class of nonsmooth constrained  optimization problems, which is well suited for our formulation of sparse  pca
OWNX	additionally, we propose two nonmonotone gradient methods for solving  the augmented lagrangian subproblems, and establish their global and  local convergence
OWNX	finally, we compare our sparse pca approach with  several existing methods on synthetic, random, and real data, respectively
OWNX	the computational results demonstrate that the sparse pcs produced by our approach  substantially outperform those by other methods in terms of total  explained variance, correlation of pcs, and orthogonality of loading vectors \vskip14pt   {key words:} sparse pca, augmented lagrangian method,  nonmonotone gradient methods, nonsmooth minimization  \vskip14pt   {ams 2000 subject classification:} 62h20, 62h25, 62h30, 90c30, 65k05
MISC	it has been widely used in  numerous applications in science and engineering such as biology,  chemistry, image processing, machine learning and so on
MISC	for  example, pca has recently been applied to human face recognition,  handwritten zip code classification and gene expression data  analysis (see  citation )
MISC	in essence, pca aims at finding a few linear combinations of the  original variables, called  principal components  (pcs), which  point in orthogonal directions capturing as much of the variance  of the variables as possible
MISC	however,  symbol  is typically unknown in practice
MISC	without loss of  generality, assume  symbol  is centered, that is, the column means of  symbol   are all  symbol
MISC	it is worth noting that  symbol   can also be obtained by performing the svd of  symbol  (see, for  example,  citation )
MISC	clearly, the columns of  symbol  are orthonormal  vectors, and moreover  symbol  is diagonal
OWNX	we thus immediately see  that if  symbol , the corresponding pcs are uncorrelated;  otherwise, they can be correlated with each other (see section   for details)
MISC	in practice, typically the first few pcs are enough to represent the data,  thus a great dimensionality reduction is achieved
MISC	in spite of the popularity  and success of pca due to these nice features, pca has an obvious drawback,  that is, pcs are usually linear combinations of all  symbol  variables and the  loadings are typically nonzero
MISC	this makes it often difficult to interpret  the pcs, especially when  symbol  is large
MISC	indeed, in many applications, the original  variables have concrete physical meaning
MISC	in these cases,  the interpretation of pcs would be facilitated if they were composed only  from a small number of the original variables, namely, each pc involved a  small number of nonzero loadings
MISC	it is thus imperative to develop sparse  pca techniques for finding the pcs with sparse loadings while enjoying the  above three nice properties as much as possible
MISC	sparse pca has been an active research topic for more than a decade
MISC	the first  class of approaches are based on ad-hoc methods by post-processing the pcs  obtained from the standard pca mentioned above
MISC	for example, jolliffe  citation   applied various rotation techniques to the standard pcs for obtaining sparse loading  vectors
MISC	cadima and jolliffe  citation  proposed a simple thresholding approach  by artificially setting to zero the standard pcs' loadings with absolute values  smaller than a threshold
MISC	in recent years, optimization approaches have been  proposed for finding sparse pcs
MISC	for instance, jolliffe et al \  citation  proposed  an interesting algorithm, called scotlass, for finding sparse orthogonal loading  vectors by sequentially maximizing the approximate variance explained by each pc  under the  symbol -norm penalty on loading vectors
MISC	zou et al \  citation   formulated sparse pca as a regression-type optimization problem and imposed a  combination of  symbol - and  symbol -norm penalties on the regression coefficients
MISC	d'aspremont et al \  citation  proposed a method, called dspca, for  finding sparse pcs by solving a sequence of semidefinite program relaxations  of sparse pca
MISC	shen and huang  citation  recently developed an approach  for computing sparse pcs by solving a sequence of rank-one matrix approximation  problems under several sparsity-inducing penalties
MISC	very recently, journ\'ee et al \   citation  formulated sparse pca as nonconcave maximization problems with   symbol - or  symbol -norm sparsity-inducing penalties
MISC	additionally, greedy methods were  investigated for sparse pca by moghaddam et al \  citation  and d'aspremont  et al \  citation
MISC	the pcs obtained by the above methods  citation  are usually sparse
MISC	however, the aforementioned  nice properties of the standard pcs are lost to some extent in these sparse pcs
MISC	indeed, the likely correlation among the sparse pcs are not considered in these  methods
MISC	therefore, their sparse pcs can be quite correlated with each other
MISC	also,  the total explained variance that these methods attempt to maximize can be too  optimistic as there may be some overlap among the individual variances of  sparse pcs
OWNX	we also explore the connection of this formulation with the standard  pca and show that it can be viewed as a certain perturbation of the standard  pca
OWNX	we further propose a novel augmented lagrangian method for solving a  class of nonsmooth constrained optimization problems, which is well suited  for our formulation of sparse pca
OWNX	this method differs from the classical augmented  lagrangian method in that: i) the values of the augmented lagrangian functions  at their approximate minimizers given by the method are bounded from above; and  ii) the magnitude of penalty parameters outgrows that of lagrangian multipliers  (see section  for details)
OWNX	we also propose two nonmonotone gradient  methods for minimizing a class of nonsmooth functions over a closed convex set,  which can be suitably applied to the subproblems arising in our augmented  lagrangian method
OWNX	the computational  results demonstrate that the sparse pcs obtained by our approach substantially  outperform those by the other methods in terms of total explained variance,  correlation of pcs, and orthogonality of loading vectors
OWNX	in section , we propose a new formulation for sparse pca and  explore the connection of this formulation with the standard pca
OWNX	in section  , we then develop a novel augmented lagrangian method for  a class of nonsmooth constrained problems, and propose two nonmonotone gradient  methods for minimizing a class of nonsmooth functions over a closed convex set
OWNX	in section , we discuss the applicability and implementation details  of our augmented lagrangian method for sparse pca
OWNX	finally, we present some concluding  remarks in section
MISC	while the case of small strategy sets is by now well-understood, a lot of recent work has focused on mab problems with exponentially or infinitely large  strategy sets, where one needs to assume extra structure in order to make the problem tractable
MISC	in particular, recent literature considered information on similarity between arms
MISC	contextual bandits are directly motivated by placing advertisements on webpages, one of the crucial problems in sponsored search
MISC	a particularly simple way to represent similarity information in the contextual bandit setting is via a  similarity distance  between the context-arm pairs which bounds from above the difference between the respective expected payoffs
MISC	prior work on contextual bandits with similarity uses ``uniform" partitions of the similarity space, so that each context-arm pair is approximated by the closest pair in the partition
MISC	algorithms based on ``uniform" partitions disregard the structure of the payoffs and the context arrivals, which is potentially wasteful
OWNX	we present algorithms that are based on  adaptive  partitions, and take advantage of "benign" payoffs and context arrivals without sacrificing the worst-case performance
MISC	the central idea is to maintain a finer partition in high-payoff regions of the similarity space and in popular regions of the context space
MISC	in a multi-armed bandit problem (henceforth, ``multi-armed bandit" will be abbreviated as mab), an algorithm is presented with a sequence of trials
MISC	the mab setting has been introduced in 1952 in~ citation  and studied intensively since then in operations research, economics and computer science
MISC	this setting is a clean model for the exploration-exploitation trade-off, a crucial issue in sequential decision-making under uncertainty
MISC	one standard way to evaluate the performance of a bandit algorithm is  regret , defined as the difference between the expected payoff of an optimal arm and that of the algorithm
MISC	by now the mab problem with a small finite set of arms is quite well understood, eg see~ citation
MISC	essentially, a bandit algorithm needs to find a needle in a haystack; for each algorithm there are inputs on which it performs as badly as random guessing
MISC	a common theme in these works is to assume a certain  structure  on payoff functions
MISC	assumptions of this type are natural in many applications, and often lead to efficient learning algorithms  citation
MISC	in particular, a line of work started in~ citation  assumes that some information on similarity between arms is available
MISC	contextual bandits are directly motivated by the problem of placing advertisements on webpages, one of the crucial problems in sponsored search
MISC	one can cast it as a bandit problem so that arms correspond to the possible ads, and payoffs correspond to the user clicks
MISC	then the context consists of information about the page, and perhaps the user this page is served to
OWNX	furthermore, we assume that similarity information is available on both the context and the arms
MISC	let  symbol  be the  context set  and  symbol  be the  arms set , and let  symbol  be the set of feasible context-arms pairs
MISC	in each round  symbol , the following events happen in succession:   a context  symbol  is revealed to the algorithm,  the algorithm chooses an arm  symbol  such that  symbol ,  payoff (reward)  symbol  is revealed
MISC	with  stochastic payoffs , for each pair  symbol  there is a distribution  symbol  with expectation  symbol , so that  symbol  is an independent sample from  symbol
AIMX	for simplicity, we present the subsequent definitions for the stochastic setting only, whereas the adversarial setting is fleshed out later in the paper (section~) \omit{here  symbol  is the  payoff function  defined as an independent random sample from some fixed distribution  symbol  over functions  symbol }  in general, the goal of a bandit algorithm is to maximize the total payoff  symbol , where  symbol  is the  time horizon
OWNX	in the contextual mab setting, we benchmark the algorithm's performance in terms of the context-specific ``best arm"
MISC	specifically, the goal is to minimize the  contextual regret :   the context-specific best arm is a more demanding benchmark than the best arm used in the ``standard" (context-free) definition of regret
MISC	the absence of similarity information is modeled as  symbol
MISC	an instructive special case is the  product similarity space   symbol , where  symbol  is a metric space on contexts ( context space ), and  symbol  is a metric space on arms ( arms space ), and    \xhdr{prior work: uniform partitions }  citation  consider contextual mab with similarity information on contexts
MISC	the granularity of the partition is adjusted to the time horizon, the context space, and the black-box regret guarantee for  symbol
MISC	again, the granularity of the partition is adjusted to the time horizon, the arms space, and the black-box regret guarantee for \exp
OWNX	applying these two ideas to our setting (with the product similarity space) gives a simple algorithm which we call the
OWNX	its contextual regret, even for adversarial payoffs, is  where  symbol  is the covering dimension of the context space and  symbol  is that of the arms space \xhdr{our contributions } using ``uniform" partitions disregards the potentially benign structure of expected payoffs and context arrivals
OWNX	we present two main results, one for stochastic payoffs and one for adversarial payoffs
OWNX	for stochastic payoffs, we provide an algorithm called  contextual zooming  which ``zooms in" on the regions of the context space that correspond to frequently occurring contexts, and the regions of the arms space that correspond to high-paying arms
OWNX	we develop provable guarantees that capture the ``benign-ness" of the context arrivals and the expected payoffs
OWNX	in the worst case, we match the guarantee~\refeq{eq:regret-naive} for the \naivealg
OWNX	we obtain nearly matching lower bounds using the kl-divergence techniques from~ citation
MISC	the lower bound is very general as it holds for every given (product) similarity space  and  for every fixed value of the upper bound
OWNX	our stochastic contextual mab setting, and specifically the \zoomalg, can be fruitfully applied beyond the ad placement scenario described above and beyond mab with similarity information per se
MISC	first, writing  symbol  one can incorporate ``temporal constraints" (across time, for each arm), and combine them with ``spatial constraints" (across arms, for each time)
OWNX	in particular, we recover one of the main results in~ citation
MISC	here contexts correspond to subsets of arms that are ``awake"
OWNX	in fact, we can combine significant constraints across time (for each arm) and across arms (for each time) }  \omit{for the context-free setting, our guarantees match those in~ citation
OWNX	our algorithm and analysis extends to a more general setting where some context-arms pairs may be unfeasible, and moreover the right-hand side of~\refeq{eq:lipschitzd} is replaced by an arbitrary metric on the feasible context-arms pairs }  \omit{we apply the \zoomalg{} to a (context-free) adversarial mab problem in which an adversary is constrained to change the expected payoffs of each arm  gradually , eg by a small amount in each round
MISC	this setting is naturally modeled as a contextual mab problem in which the  symbol -th context arrival is simply  symbol
OWNX	we term it the {\bf\driftproblem}
MISC	notable special cases of  symbol  include  symbol  and 	 symbol , which corresponds to, respectively, the bounded change per round and the high-probability behavior of a random walk
OWNX	we derive provable guarantees for these two examples, and show that they are essentially optimal
MISC	interestingly, the \problem{} subsumes the stochastic  sleeping bandits  problem~ citation , where in each round some arms are ``asleep", i e not available in this round
MISC	more precisely, contexts  symbol  correspond to subsets  symbol  of arms, so that only the context-arm pairs  symbol ,  symbol  are feasible, and the context distance is  symbol
MISC	moreover, the \problem{} extends the sleeping bandits setting by incorporating similarity information on arms
MISC	the \zoomalg{} (and its analysis) applies, and is geared to exploit this additional similarity information
OWNX	we develop provable guarantees that capture this ``benign-ness"
MISC	in the worst case, the contextual regret is bounded in terms of the covering dimension of the context space, matching~\refeq{eq:regret-naive}
OWNX	we obtain a clean algorithm for contextual mab with improved (and nearly optimal) bounds
MISC	one alternative approach is to maintain a partition of the context space, and run a separate instance of the zooming algorithm from~ citation  on each set in this partition
OWNX	fleshing out this idea leads to the meta-algorithm that we present for adversarial payoffs (with \bandit{} being the zooming algorithm)
MISC	this meta-algorithm is parameterized (and constrained) by a specific a priori regret bound for \bandit
OWNX	contextual zooming is  presented in section~
OWNX	lower bounds are in section~
OWNX	some applications of contextual zooming are discussed in section~
OWNX	the adversarial setting is treated in section~
OWNX	this paper focuses on the large-scale matrix factorization problem that consists of  learning  the basis set in order to adapt it to specific data
AIMX	in this paper, we propose to address these tasks with a new online optimization algorithm, based on stochastic approximations, which scales up gracefully to large data sets with millions of training samples, and extends naturally to various  matrix factorization formulations, making it suitable for a wide range of learning problems
MISC	a proof of convergence is presented, along with experiments with natural images and genomic data demonstrating that it leads to state-of-the-art performance in terms of speed and optimization for both small and large data sets
MISC	the linear decomposition of a signal using a few atoms of a  learned  dictionary instead of a predefined one---based on wavelets  citation  for example---has recently led to state-of-the-art results in numerous low-level signal processing tasks such as image denoising  citation , texture synthesis  citation  and audio processing  citation , as well as higher-level tasks such as image classification  citation , showing that sparse learned models are well adapted to natural signals
MISC	this includes non-negative matrix factorization and its variants  citation , and sparse principal component analysis  citation
MISC	while learning the dictionary has proven to be critical to achieve (or improve upon) state-of-the-art results in signal and image processing, effectively solving the corresponding optimization problem is a significant computational challenge, particularly in the context of large-scale data sets that may include millions of training samples
OWNX	we say that it admits a sparse approximation over a \mbox{ dictionary }  symbol  in  symbol , with  symbol  columns referred to as  atoms , when one can find a linear combination of a ``few'' atoms from  symbol  that is ``close'' to the signal  symbol
MISC	experiments have shown that modelling a signal with such a sparse decomposition ( sparse coding ) is very effective in many signal processing applications  citation
MISC	for natural images, predefined dictionaries based on various types of wavelets  citation  have also been used for this task
MISC	however, learning the dictionary instead of using off-the-shelf bases has been shown to dramatically improve signal reconstruction  citation
MISC	most recent algorithms for dictionary learning  citation  are iterative  batch  procedures, accessing the whole training set at each iteration in order to minimize a cost function under some constraints, and cannot efficiently deal with very large training sets  citation , or dynamic training data changing over time, such as video sequences
MISC	this is particularly important in the context of image and video processing  citation , where it is common to learn dictionaries adapted to small patches, with training data that may include several millions of these patches (roughly one per pixel and per frame)
OWNX	in this setting, online techniques based on stochastic approximations are an attractive alternative to batch methods~(see, eg ,  citation )
MISC	for example, first-order stochastic gradient descent with projections on the constraint set  citation  is sometimes used for dictionary learning (see  citation  for instance)
OWNX	the proposed method is introduced in section , with a proof of convergence in section~
OWNX	section~ extends our algorithm to various matrix factorization problems that generalize dictionary learning, and section  is devoted to experimental results, demonstrating that our algorithm is suited to a wide class of learning problems
OWNX	we provide finite horizon regret bounds for this algorithm as well as a numerical evaluation of its performance in the single channel model as well as in the case of stochastically identical channels
MISC	in recent years, opportunistic spectrum access for cognitive radio has been the focus of significant research efforts  citation
MISC	these works propose to improve spectral efficiency by making smarter use of the large portion of the frequency bands that remains unused
MISC	in licensed band cognitive radio, the goal is to share the bands licensed to primary users with non primary users called secondary users or cognitive users
MISC	these secondary users must carefully %sense the primary users's presence and adapt their own transmission identify available spectrum resources and communicate avoiding to disturb the primary network
MISC	opportunistic spectrum access thus has the potential for significantly increasing the spectral efficiency of wireless networks
MISC	the  symbol  channels are modeled as gilbert-elliot channels: at each time slot, a channel is either idle or occupied and the availability of the channel evolves in a markovian way
MISC	under this model, channel allocation may be interpreted as a planning task in a particular class of partially observed markov decision process (pomdp) also called restless bandits  citation
MISC	in the works of  citation , it is assumed that the statistical information about the primary users' traffic is fully available to the secondary user
MISC	in practice however, the statistical characteristics of the traffic %(i e the transition probabilities of the availabilty of each channel)  are not fixed a priori and must be somehow estimated by the secondary user
OWNX	we consider scenarios in which the secondary user first carries out an  exploration phase  in which the statistical information regarding the model is gathered and then follows by the  exploitation phase , where the optimal sensing policy, based on the estimated parameters, is applied
MISC	the key issue is to reach the proper balance between exploration and exploitation
MISC	this issue has been considered before by  citation  who proposed an asymptotic rule to set the length of the exploration phase but without a precise evaluation of the performance of this approach
MISC	lai et al  citation  also considered this problem in the multiple secondary users case but in a simpler model where each channel is modeled as an independent and identically distributed source
MISC	in the field of reinforcement learning, this class of problems is known as  model-based reinforcement learning  for which several approaches have been proposed recently  citation
OWNX	our contribution consists in proposing a strategy, termed  tiling algorithm , for adaptively setting the length of the exploration phase
OWNX	under this strategy, the length of the exploration phase is not fixed beforehand and the exploration phase is terminated as soon as we have accumulated enough statistical evidence to determine the optimal sensing policy
MISC	the distinctive feature of this approach is that it comes with strong performance guarantees in the form of finite-horizon regret bounds
MISC	remark that the channel access model corresponds to a specific example of pomdp parameterized by the transition probabilities of the availability of each channel
MISC	as the approach relies on the restrictive assumption that for each possible parameter value the solution of the planning problem be fully known, it is not applicable to pomdps at large but is well suited to the case of the channel allocation model
OWNX	we provide a detailed account of the use of the approach for two simple instances of the opportunistic channel access model, including the case of stochastically identical channels considered by  citation
OWNX	the channel allocation model is formally described in section
OWNX	in section , the tiling algorithm is presented and its performance in terms of finite-horizon regret bounds are obtained
OWNX	the application to opportunistic channel access is detailed in section , both in the one channel model and in the case of stochastically identical channels
OWNX	we present a streaming model for large-scale classification (in the context of  symbol -svm)  by leveraging connections between learning and computational geometry
MISC	the streaming model imposes the constraint that only a single pass over the data is allowed
MISC	the  symbol -svm is known to have an equivalent formulation in terms of the minimum enclosing ball (meb) problem, and an efficient algorithm based on the idea of  core sets  exists (cvm)  citation
MISC	however cvm works in batch mode requiring multiple passes over the data
OWNX	we show that the meb updates for the streaming case can be easily adapted to learn the svm weight vector in a way similar to using online stochastic gradient updates
MISC	streaming model also applies to cases such as disk-resident large datasets which cannot be stored in memory
MISC	unfortunately, standard learning algorithms do not scale well for such cases
MISC	in spite of the severe limitations imposed by the streaming framework, streaming algorithms have been successfully employed in many different domains  citation
MISC	many of the problems in geometry can be adapted to the streaming setting and since many learning problems have equivalent geometric formulations, streaming algorithms naturally motivate the development of efficient techniques for solving (or approximating) large-scale batch learning problems
OWNX	since the support vector machine is a widely used classification framework, we believe success here will encourage further research into other frameworks
MISC	svms are known to have a natural formulation in terms of the minimum enclosing ball problem in a high dimensional space  citation
MISC	this latter problem has been extensively studied in the computational geometry literature and admits natural streaming algorithms  citation
OWNX	we adapt these algorithms to the classification setting, provide some extensions, and outline some open issues
OWNX	our experiments show that we can learn efficiently in just one pass and get competetive classification accuracies on synthetic and real datasets
OWNX	we start from a simple asymptotic result for the problem of on-line regression with the quadratic loss function: the class of continuous limited-memory prediction strategies admits a ``leading prediction strategy'', which not only asymptotically performs at least as well as any continuous limited-memory strategy but also satisfies the property that the excess loss of any continuous limited-memory strategy is determined by how closely it imitates the leading strategy
MISC	it is well known that, under some restrictions on  symbol , there exists a ``master prediction strategy'' (sometimes also called a ``universal strategy'') that performs almost as well as the best strategies in  symbol  whose norm is not too large (see, eg ,  citation )
MISC	in the following two sections proposition  is generalized in two directions, to the loss functions given by bregman divergences (\s) and by strictly proper scoring rules (\s)
OWNX	the final section, \s, discusses % the general picture and  possible directions of further research
MISC	there are many techniques for constructing master strategies, such as gradient descent, strong and weak aggregating algorithms, following the perturbed leader, defensive forecasting, to mention just a few
AIMX	in this paper we will use defensive forecasting (proposed in  citation  and based on  citation  and much earlier work by levin, foster, and vohra)
MISC	the master strategies constructed using defensive forecasting automatically satisfy the stronger properties required of leading strategies; on the other hand, it is not clear whether leading strategies can be constructed using other techniques
OWNX	we formulate a probability distribution whose partition function is exactly the permanent, then use bethe free energy to approximate this partition function
OWNX	finally, we demonstrate the advantages of using this approximation
MISC	the permanent is a scalar quantity computed from a matrix and has been an active topic of research for well over a century
MISC	it plays a role in cryptography and statistical physics where it is fundamental to ising and dimer models
MISC	while the determinant of an  symbol  matrix can be evaluated exactly in sub-cubic time, efficient methods for computing the permanent have remained elusive
MISC	since the permanent is  symbol p-complete, efficient exact evaluations cannot be found in general
MISC	the best exact methods improve over brute force ( symbol ) and include ryser's algorithm  citation  which requires as many as  symbol  arithmetic operations
MISC	recently, significant progress has produced an fpras that can handle arbitrary  symbol  matrices with non-negative entries  citation
MISC	it remains to be seen if other approximate inference methods can be brought to bear on the permanent
MISC	the method is exact for singly-connected networks such as trees
MISC	in certain special loopy graph cases, including graphs with a single loop, bipartite matching graphs  citation  and bipartite multi-matching graphs  citation , the convergence of bp has been proven
MISC	in more general loopy graphs, loopy bp still maintains some surprising empirical success
MISC	theoretical understanding of the convergence of loopy bp has recently been improved by noting certain general conditions for its fixed points and relating them to minima of bethe free energy
OWNX	in section , we describe a probability distribution parameterized by a matrix similar to those described in  citation  for which the partition function is exactly the permanent
OWNX	in section , we discuss bethe free energy and introduce belief propagation as a method of finding a suitable set of pseudo-marginals for the bethe approximation
OWNX	in section , we report results from experiments
OWNX	we then conclude with a brief discussion
MISC	mixed types (integer and real) are used to represent variables within the evolutionary algorithm
OWNX	we test the algorithm on several artificial data sets, and also on real astronomical observations of quasar q0957+561
OWNX	by carrying out a statistical analysis of the results we present a detailed comparison of our method with the most popular methods for time delay estimation in astrophysics
OWNX	our method yields more accurate and more stable time delay estimates: for q0957+561, we obtain 419 6 days between images a and b
MISC	the  estimation of  time delay , the delay between arrival times of two signals that originate from the same source but travel along different paths to the observer, is a real-world problem in astronomy
MISC	a time series to be analysed could, for instance, represent the repeated measurement, over many months or years, of the flux of radiation (optical light or radio waves) from a very distant quasar, a very bright source of light usually a few billion light-years away
OWNX	some of these quasars appear as a set of multiple nearby images on the sky, due to the fact that the trajectory of light coming from the source gets bent as it passes a massive galaxy on the way (the ``lens''), and, as a result, the observer receives the light from various directions, resulting in the detection of several images  citation
MISC	this phenomenon is called gravitational lensing, and is a natural consequence of a prediction of the general theory of relativity, which postulates that massive objects distort space-time and thus cause the bending of trajectories of light rays passing near them
MISC	quasars are variable sources, and the same sequence of variations is detected at different times in the different images, according to the travel time along the various paths
MISC	the time delay between the signals depends on the  mass of the lens, and thus it is the most direct method to measure the distribution of matter in the universe, which is often dark  citation
MISC	this is due to practical limitations of observation such as equipment availability, weather conditions, the brightness of the moon, among many other factors  citation
OWNX	here we focus on q0957+561, the first multiply-imaged quasar to be discovered  citation
MISC	this source, which has a pair of images (here referred to as a and b), has been monitored for over twenty years, and despite numerous claims, a universally agreed value for the time delay in this system has not emerged  citation
AIMX	in an earlier paper, we presented an analysis of repeated radio observations, along with simulated data generated according to the properties of these observations  citation , to show that a kernel-based approach can improve upon the currently popular methods of estimating time delays from real astronomical data
OWNX	here we present a largely modified approach that outperforms  on optical datasets our previous appraoch, as well as alternative approaches in use in astrophysics
OWNX	here we introduce a novel  evolutionary algorithm (ea) to estimate the parameters of a model-based method for time delay estimation
MISC	the ea uses, as a fitness function, the mean squared error (mse symbol ) given by cross-validation on observed data, and also performs a novel regularisation procedure based on singular value decomposition (svd)
MISC	this approach can be applied to other problems, not only time series from gravitational lensing
MISC	for instance, the missing data problems cover those cases where instrumental equipment fails, observations are  incorrectly recorded, sociological factors are involved, etc
MISC	therefore, the data are unevenly sampled, which restricts the use of fourier analysis  citation (\s13 8)
MISC	problems with noisy and missing data occur in almost all sciences, where the data availability is influenced by what is easy or feasible to collect (e g , see  citation )
OWNX	we compare the performance of our ea in several ways:    the performance of our method is assessed against that of two of the most popular methods in the astrophysical literature  citation , i e ,  {(a)} the dispersion spectra method  citation  and {(b)} a scheme based on the structure function of the intrinsic variability of the source, here referred to as the prh method  citation
OWNX	we employ three kinds of artificial data sets: large scale data  citation , prh data  citation  and wiener data (as outlined in  citation )
OWNX	to justify our ea, an analogous non-evolutionary model-based approach (k-v) is also employed in this paper
OWNX	we use our ea as well as a (1+1)-es algorithm  citation  on actual astronomical observations, where the twin images were observed over several years with optical telescopes  citation
OWNX	the results and our conclusions are in and respectively
OWNX	finally, our future work is presented in
OWNX	we develop  abc-logitboost , based on the prior work on  abc-boost  citation  and  robust logitboost  citation
OWNX	our extensive experiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate the considerable  improvement of  abc-logitboost  over  logitboost  and  abc-mart
MISC	boosting algorithms  citation  have become very successful in machine learning
OWNX	this study revisits  logitboost  citation  under the framework of  adaptive base class boost (abc-boost)  in  citation , for multi-class classification
OWNX	we denote a training dataset by  symbol , where  symbol  is the number of feature vectors (samples),  symbol  is the  symbol th feature vector, and   symbol  is the  symbol th class label, where  symbol  in multi-class classification
MISC	the parameters,  symbol  and  symbol , are learned from the data, by maximum likelihood, which is equivalent to minimizing the  negative log-likelihood loss   where  symbol  if  symbol  and  symbol  otherwise
MISC	for identifiability, the ``sum-to-zero'' constraint,  symbol , is usually adopted  citation
MISC	median clustering extends popular neural data analysis methods such as the self-organizing map or neural gas to general data structures given by a dissimilarity matrix only
MISC	this offers flexible and robust global data inspection methods which are particularly suited for a variety of data as occurs in biomedical domains
OWNX	in this chapter, we give an overview about median clustering and its properties and extensions, with a particular focus on efficient implementations adapted to large scale data analysis
MISC	in biomedical domains, prototype based methods are particularly  well suited since they represent data in terms of typical values which can be directly inspected by humans and visualized in the plane  if an additional low-dimensional neighborhood or embedding is present
MISC	popular methodologies include k-means clustering, the self-organizing map, neural gas, affinity propagation, etc
MISC	which have successfully been applied to various problems in the biomedical domain such as gene expression analysis, inspection of mass spectrometric data, health-care, analysis of microarray  data, protein sequences, medical image analysis, etc \  citation
MISC	many popular prototype-based clustering algorithms, however, have been derived for euclidean data embedded in a real-vector space
MISC	in biomedical applications, data are diverse including temporal signals such as eeg and ekg signals,  functional data such as mass spectra, sequential data such as dna sequences, complex graph structures such as biological networks, etc
MISC	often, the euclidean metric is not appropriate to compare such data, rather, a problem dependent similarity or dissimilarity measure should be used such as  alignment, correlation, graph distances, functional metrics,  or general kernels
MISC	various extensions of prototype-based methods towards more general data structures exist such as extensions for recurrent and recursive data structures, functional versions, or kernelized formulations, see eg \  citation  for an overview
MISC	a very general approach relies on  a matrix which characterizes the pairwise similarities or dissimilarities of data
MISC	several approaches extend popular clustering algorithms such as k-means or the self-organizing map towards this setting by means of the relational dual formulation or kernelization of the approaches  citation
MISC	these methods have the drawback that they partially require specific properties of the dissimilarity matrix (such as positive definiteness), and they represent data in terms of prototypes which are given by (possibly implicit) mixtures of training points, thus they cannot easily be interpreted directly
MISC	an alternative is offered by a representation of classes by the median or centroid, i e \ prototype locations are restricted to the discrete set given by the training data
MISC	the resulting learning problem is connected to a  well-studied optimization problem, the k-median problem: given a set of data points and pairwise dissimilarities, find  symbol  points forming centroids and an assignment of the data into k classes such that the average dissimilarities of points to their respective closest centroid is minimized
MISC	this problem is np hard in general unless the dissimilarities have a special form (e g \ tree metrics),  and there exist constant factor approximations for specific settings (e g \ metrics)  citation
MISC	this results in a complexity  symbol  for one epoch for k-centers clustering instead of  symbol  for k-means,  symbol  being the number of data points
MISC	various approaches optimize the cost function of k-means or k-median by different methods to avoid local optima as much as possible, such as lagrange relaxations of the corresponding integer linear program, vertex substitution heuristics, or affinity propagation  citation
MISC	in the past years, simple, but powerful  extensions of neural based clustering to general dissimilarities have been proposed which can be seen as generalizations of k-centers clustering to include neighborhood cooperation, such that the topology of data is taken into account
MISC	more precisely, the median clustering has been integrated into the popular self-organizing map (som)  citation  and its applicability has been demonstrated in a large scale experiment from bioinformatics  citation
MISC	later, the same idea has been integrated into neural gas (ng) clustering together with a proof of the convergence of median som and median ng clustering  citation
MISC	like k-centers clustering, the methods require an exhaustive search to obtain optimum prototypes given fixed assignments such that the complexity of a standard implementation for one epoch is  symbol  (this can be reduced to  symbol  for median som, see section  and  citation )
MISC	apart from this numerical stability, the methods have further benefits: they are given by simple formulas and they are very easy to implement, they rely on underlying cost functions which can be extended towards the setting of partial supervision, and in many  situations a considerable speed-up of the algorithm can be obtained, as demonstrated in  citation , for example
OWNX	in this chapter, we present an overview about neural based median clustering
OWNX	afterwards, we discuss several possibilities to speed-up the clustering algorithms, including exact methods, as well as single pass approximations for large data sets
OWNX	our approach is based on a direct approximation of aixi, a bayesian optimality notion for general reinforcement learning agents
MISC	previously, it has been unclear whether the theory of aixi could motivate the design of practical algorithms
OWNX	we answer this hitherto open question in the affirmative, by providing the first computationally feasible approximation to the aixi agent
OWNX	to develop our approximation, we introduce a new monte-carlo tree search algorithm along with an agent-specific extension to the context tree weighting algorithm
OWNX	empirically, we present a set of encouraging results on a variety of stochastic and partially observable domains
OWNX	we conclude by proposing a number of directions for future research
MISC	reinforcement learning  citation  is a popular and influential paradigm for agents that learn from experience
MISC	aixi  citation  is a bayesian optimality notion for reinforcement learning agents in unknown environments
MISC	consider an agent that exists within some unknown environment
MISC	the agent interacts with the environment in cycles
MISC	the only information available to the agent is its history of previous interactions
MISC	the  general reinforcement learning problem  is to construct an agent that, over time, collects as much reward as possible from the (unknown) environment
MISC	the aixi agent is a mathematical solution to the general reinforcement learning problem
MISC	to achieve generality, the environment is assumed to be an unknown but computable function; i e \ the observations and rewards received by the agent, given its past actions, can be computed by some program running on a turing machine
MISC	the aixi agent results from a synthesis of two ideas: sep1mm\parskip0mm  the use of a finite-horizon expectimax operation from sequential decision theory for action selection; and  an extension of solomonoff's universal induction scheme  citation  for future prediction in the agent context
MISC	more formally, let  symbol  denote the output of a universal turing machine  symbol  supplied with program  symbol  and input  symbol ,  symbol  a finite lookahead horizon, and  symbol  the length in bits of program  symbol
MISC	the action picked by aixi at time  symbol , having executed actions  symbol  and having received the sequence of observation-reward pairs  symbol  from the environment, is given by:  symbol } intuitively, the agent considers the sum of the total reward over all possible futures up to  symbol  steps ahead, weighs each of them by the complexity of programs consistent with the agent's past that can generate that future, and then picks the action that maximises expected future rewards
MISC	equation () embodies in one line the major ideas of bayes, ockham, epicurus, turing, von neumann, bellman, kolmogorov, and solomonoff
MISC	the aixi agent is rigorously shown by  citation  to be optimal in many different senses of the word
MISC	in particular, the aixi agent will rapidly learn an accurate model of the environment and proceed to act optimally to achieve its goal
MISC	accessible overviews of the aixi agent have been given by both  citation  and  citation
MISC	a complete description of the agent can be found in  citation
MISC	as the aixi agent is only asymptotically computable, it is by no means an algorithmic solution to the general reinforcement learning problem
MISC	rather it is best understood as a bayesian  optimality notion  for decision making in general unknown environments
MISC	as such, its role in general ai research should be viewed in, for example, the same way the minimax and empirical risk minimisation principles are viewed in decision theory and statistical machine learning research
MISC	these principles define what is optimal behaviour if computational complexity is not an issue, and can provide important theoretical guidance in the design of practical algorithms
MISC	as can be seen in equation~(), there are two parts to aixi
OWNX	the first is the expectimax search into the future which we will call  planning
MISC	both parts need to be approximated for computational tractability
MISC	there are many different approaches one can try
OWNX	section  introduces the notation and definitions we use to describe environments and accumulated agent experience, including the familiar notions of reward, policy and value functions for our setting
OWNX	section  describes a general bayesian approach for learning a model of the environment
OWNX	section  then presents a monte-carlo tree search procedure that we will use to approximate the expectimax operation in aixi
OWNX	this is followed by a description of the context tree weighting algorithm and how it can be generalised for use in the agent setting in section
OWNX	we put the two ideas together in section  to form our aixi approximation algorithm
OWNX	section  provides a discussion of related work and the limitations of our current approach
OWNX	section  highlights a number of areas for future investigation
OWNX	we consider the problem of high-dimensional non-linear variable selection for supervised learning
OWNX	moreover, we study the consistency of variable selection  in high-dimensional settings, showing that under certain assumptions, our regularization framework allows a number of irrelevant variables which is  exponential in the number of observations
OWNX	our simulations on synthetic datasets and datasets from the uci repository show state-of-the-art predictive performance for non-linear regression problems
MISC	in such settings, some notion of sparsity is a fruitful way of avoiding overfitting, for example through variable or feature selection
MISC	this has led to many  algorithmic and theoretical advances
MISC	in particular, regularization by sparsity-inducing norms such as the  symbol -norm has  attracted a lot of interest in recent years
MISC	by using appropriate regularization by hilbertian norms, representer theorems enable to consider large and potentially infinite-dimensional feature spaces while working within an implicit feature space no larger than the number of observations
MISC	this has led to numerous works on kernel design adapted to specific data types and generic kernel-based algorithms for many learning tasks  citation
CONT	however, while non-linearity is required in many domains such as computer vision or bioinformatics, most theoretical results related to non-parametric methods do not scale well with input dimensions
OWNX	in this paper, our goal is to bridge the gap between linear and non-linear methods, by tackling  high-dimensional non-linear  problems
MISC	among classical  methods, some are implicitly or explicitly based on sparsity and model selection, such as boosting~ citation , multivariate additive regression splines~ citation ,  decision trees~ citation , random forests~ citation , cosso~ citation  or gaussian process based methods~ citation , while some others do not rely on sparsity, such as nearest neighbors or kernel methods~ citation
MISC	theoretical results suggest that with appropriate assumptions,  sparse methods such as greedy methods and methods based on the  symbol -norm would be able to deal correctly with  symbol  features if  symbol  is of the order of the number of observations  symbol ~ citation
MISC	however, in presence of more than a few dozen variables, in order to deal with that many features, or even to simply enumerate those, a certain form of factorization or recursivity is needed
AIMX	in this paper, we propose to use a hierarchical structure based on directed acyclic graphs, which is natural in our context of non-linear variable selection
OWNX	we consider a positive definite kernel that can be expressed as a large sum of positive definite  basis  or  local kernels
MISC	one major difficulty however is that the number of these smaller kernels is usually exponential in the dimension of the input space and applying multiple kernel learning directly to this decomposition would be intractable
OWNX	in order to perform selection efficiently, we make the extra assumption that these small kernels can be embedded in a  directed acyclic graph  (dag)
OWNX	following~ citation , we consider in \mysec{mkl} a specific combination of  symbol -norms that is adapted to the dag, and that will restrict the authorized sparsity patterns to certain configurations; in our specific kernel-based framework, we are able to use the dag to design an optimization algorithm which has polynomial complexity in the number of selected kernels (\mysec{optimization})
OWNX	in simulations (\mysec{simulations}), we focus on   directed grids , where our framework allows to perform non-linear variable selection
OWNX	we provide some experimental validation of our novel regularization framework; in particular, we compare it to the regular  symbol -regularization, greedy forward selection and non-kernel-based methods, and shows that it is always competitive and often leads to better performance, both on synthetic examples, and standard regression datasets from the uci repository
OWNX	in particular, we show that our framework is adapted to estimating consistently only the  hull   of the relevant variables
OWNX	hence, by restricting the statistical power of our method, we gain computational efficiency
OWNX	moreover, we show that we can obtain scalings between the number of variables and the number of observations which are similar to the linear case~ citation : indeed, we show that our regularization framework may achieve non-linear variable selection consistency even with a number of variables  symbol  which is exponential in the number of observations  symbol
OWNX	since we deal with  symbol  kernels, we achieve consistency with a number of kernels which is  doubly  exponential in  symbol
OWNX	moreover, for general directed acyclic graphs, we show that the total number of vertices may grow unbounded as long as the maximal out-degree (number of children) in the dag is less than exponential in the number of observations
AIMX	this paper extends previous work~ citation , by providing more background on multiple kernel learning, detailing all proofs, providing new consistency results in high dimension, and comparing our non-linear predictors with non-kernel-based methods \paragraph{notation } throughout the paper we consider hilbertian norms  symbol  for elements  symbol  of hilbert spaces, where the specific hilbert space can always be inferred from the context (unless otherwise stated)
OWNX	we   denote by  symbol  and  symbol  the largest and smallest eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix  symbol
MISC	these are naturally extended to compact self-adjoint operators~ citation
MISC	moreover, given a vector  symbol  in the product space  symbol  and a subset  symbol  of  symbol ,  symbol  denotes the vector in  symbol  of elements of  symbol  indexed by  symbol
MISC	similarly, for a matrix  symbol  defined with  symbol  blocks adapted to  symbol ,  symbol   denotes the submatrix of   symbol  composed of blocks of  symbol  whose rows are in  symbol  and columns are in  symbol
MISC	moreover,  symbol  denotes the cardinal of the set  symbol  and  symbol  denotes the dimension of the hilbert space  symbol
OWNX	we denote by  symbol    the  symbol -dimensional vector of ones
OWNX	we denote by  symbol  the positive part of a real number  symbol
OWNX	finally, we let denote  symbol  and  symbol  general probability measures and expectations
MISC	finding the minimum enclosing convex polytope (mecp) is a related problem wherein a convex polytope of a fixed shape is given and the aim is to find the smallest magnification of the polytope which encloses the given points
OWNX	for this problem we present a  symbol  approximation algorithm, where  symbol  is the number of faces of the polytope
OWNX	in particular, we specialize the excessive gap framework of  citation  to obtain our results
MISC	the problem of finding a meb arises in application areas as diverse as data mining, learning, statistics, computer graphics, and computational geometry  citation
MISC	therefore efficient algorithms for this problem are not only of theoretical interest, but also have wide practical applicability
MISC	exact algorithms for finding the meb typically have an exponential dependence on  symbol   citation
MISC	for example, the  citation  algorithm runs in  symbol  time which makes it inadmissible for many practical applications; in the case of linear svms data may have a million or more dimensions
MISC	therefore, there has been a significant interest in finding approximation algorithms for this problem
MISC	state of the art approximation algorithms for the meb problem extensively use the concept of coresets  citation
MISC	therefore, locating an  symbol -coreset is equivalent to finding an  symbol  approximation algorithm to the meb problem
MISC	the approximation guarantees of such algorithms are  multiplicative
MISC	briefly, a coreset is built incrementally in a greedy fashion  citation
MISC	at every iteration, the meb of the current candidate coreset is built
MISC	if every point in  symbol  lies in an  symbol  ball of the current solution then the algorithm stops, otherwise the most  violated  point, that is, the point which is furthest away from the current meb is included in the candidate coreset and the iterations continue
MISC	the best known algorithms in this family have a running time of  symbol   citation
OWNX	in contrast, we present a new algorithm which is derived by casting the problem of finding the meb as a convex but non-smooth optimization problem
OWNX	although these two types of approximation guarantees seem different, by a simple argument in section , we show that our algorithm also yields a traditional scale-invariant  symbol  multiplicative approximation with  symbol  effort
OWNX	we extend our analysis to the closely related minimum enclosing convex polytope (mecp) problem, and present a new algorithm
MISC	as before, given a set  symbol  of  symbol  points in  symbol , the task here is to find the smallest polytope of a given fixed shape which encloses these points
OWNX	in our setting translations and magnifications are allowed but rotations are not allowed
OWNX	we apply our algorithms to two problems of interest in machine learning namely finding the maximum margin hyperplane and computing the distance of a polytope from the origin
MISC	a coreset algorithm for the first problem was proposed by  citation  while the second one was studied by  citation
OWNX	we discuss some applications of our results to machine learning problems in section
MISC	conditional random fields (crfs) constitute a popular and efficient approach for supervised sequence labelling
OWNX	we first show how sparsity of the parameter set can be exploited to significantly speed up training and labelling
OWNX	we then introduce coordinate descent parameter update schemes for crfs with  symbol  regularization
OWNX	we finally provide some empirical comparisons of the proposed approach with state-of-the-art crf training strategies
MISC	in particular, it is shown that the proposed approach is able to take profit of the sparsity to speed up processing and handle larger dimensional models
MISC	conditional random fields (crfs), originally introduced in  citation , constitute a popular and effective approach for supervised structure learning tasks involving the mapping between complex objects such as strings and trees
MISC	an important property of crfs is their ability to cope with large and redundant feature sets and to integrate some form of structural dependency between output labels
MISC	directly modeling the conditional probability of the label sequence given the observation stream allows to explicitly integrate complex dependencies that can not directly be accounted for in generative models such as hidden markov models (hmms)
OWNX	results presented in section~ will illustrate this ability to use large sets of redundant and non-causal features
MISC	training a crf amounts to solving a convex optimization problem: the maximization of the penalized conditional log-likelihood function
MISC	for lack of an analytical solution however, the crf training task requires numerical optimization and implies to  repeatedly perform inference over the entire training set during the computation of the gradient of the objective function
MISC	this is where the modeling of structure takes its toll: for general dependencies, exact inference is intractable and approximations have to be considered
MISC	in the simpler case of linear-chain crfs, modeling the interaction between pairs of adjacent labels makes the complexity of inference grow quadratically with the size of label set: even in this restricted setting, training a crf remains a computational burden, especially when the number of output labels is large
MISC	introducing structure has another, less studied, impact on the number of potential features that can be considered
MISC	however, their number scales quadratically with the number of labels, yielding both a computational (feature functions have to be computed, parameter vectors have to be stored in memory) and an estimation problem
MISC	the estimation problem stems from the need to estimate large parameter vectors based on sparse training data
MISC	penalizing the objective function with the  symbol  norm of the parameter vector is an effective remedy to overfitting; yet, it does not decrease the number of feature computations that are needed
OWNX	as we will show, inducing a sparse vector not only reduces the number of feature functions that need to be computed, but it can also reduce the time needed to perform parameter estimation and decoding
MISC	proposals have been made to overcome this difficulty: for instance, the orthant-wise limited-memory quasi-newton algorithm  citation  uses the fact that the  symbol  norm remains differentiable when restricted to regions in which the sign of each coordinate is fixed (an ``orthant'')
MISC	using this technique,  citation  reports test performance that are on par with those obtained with a  symbol  penalty, albeit with more compact models
OWNX	our first contribution is to show that even in this situation (equivalent test performance), the   symbol  regularization may be preferable as sparsity in the parameter set can be exploited to reduce the computational cost associated with parameter training and label inference
MISC	in a nutshell, optimization is performed in a coordinate-wise fashion, based on an analytic solution to the unidimensional optimization problem
OWNX	our main methodological contributions are thus twofold: (i) a fast implementation of the training and decoding algorithms that uses the sparsity of parameter vectors and (ii) a novel optimization algorithm for using  symbol  penalty with crfs
OWNX	these two ideas combined together offer the opportunity of using very large ``virtual'' feature sets for which only a very small number of features are effectively selected
OWNX	in particular, we provide detailed comparisons, in terms of numerical efficiency, with solutions traditionally used for  symbol  and  symbol  penalized training of crfs in publicly available software such as crf++  citation ,  crfsuite  citation  and crfsgd  citation
OWNX	we then study, in section , the training algorithm used to achieve sparsity, which implements a coordinate-wise descent procedure
OWNX	section~ discusses our contributions with respect to related work
OWNX	and finally, section  presents our experimental results, obtained both on simulated data, a phonetization task, and a named entity recognition problem
OWNX	allowing randomization, we remove the requirement of convexity
OWNX	in the previous papers  citation  and  citation  we constructed prediction strategies competitive with the important classes of markov and stationary, respectively, continuous prediction strategies
OWNX	our main results assert the existence of prediction strategies competitive with the markov strategies
MISC	skorokhod's idea was to allow small deformations not only along the vertical axis but also along the horizontal axis when defining neighborhoods
OWNX	in contrast with most existing approaches, we can only access the ``hidden'' space in which the objects live through a similarity oracle
MISC	the oracle attempts to model the behavior of human users, capable of making statements about similarity, but not of assigning meaningful numerical values to distances between objects
OWNX	we call the position of object  symbol  in this list the  rank  of  symbol  with respect to  symbol
OWNX	we use two different characterizations of the underlying space to capture this property
MISC	the first one,  rank distortion , relates pairwise ranks to the average difference in ranks w r t
OWNX	other objects (a more precise definition is given in section )
OWNX	the second one, the combinatorial framework (a notion from  citation ), defines approximate triangle inequalities on ranks (a more precise definition is given in section )
OWNX	utilizing the insights from these ideas, we develop a hierarchical search algorithm that builds a data structure, which allows us to retrieve the nearest neighbor with high probability in  symbol  questions
OWNX	we also provide an approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm
OWNX	we also introduce  rank-sensitive  hash functions which gives same hash value for ``similar'' objects based on the rank-value of the objects obtained from the similarity oracle
OWNX	as one application of rsh, we demonstrate that, we can retrieve one of the  symbol -nearest neighbor of a query point in  symbol  evaluations of the hash function, where  symbol  only depends on  symbol  and the rank distortion
OWNX	consider the situation where we want to search and navigate a database, but we do not know the underlying relationships between the objects
MISC	in particular, distances may be difficult to discern, or may not be well-defined
MISC	such situations are common with  objects where human perception may be involved
MISC	indeed, the distances between feature vectors might be far from the similarity perceived by humans
OWNX	notwithstanding, either with human-assistance or approximate classification, we may be able to determine the relative proximity of an object with respect to a small number of other objects
MISC	humans have the ability to compare objects and make statements about which are the most similar ones, though they can probably not assign a meaningful numerical value to similarity
MISC	this led to the question of how to design search algorithms based on binary similarity decisions of the type ``a looks more like b than c''
MISC	to do so, we have access to a similarity oracle which, given two reference objects and a query object, can tell which of the two reference objects is most similar to the query object
OWNX	we measure the performance of all our algorithms in terms of the number of questions that we need to ask the oracle
OWNX	we can pre-process the database during a learning phase, and use the resulting answers to facilitate the search process
OWNX	we do  not  make the assumption that the ``hidden'' space in which the database objects live needs to be a metric space
MISC	using this oracle one can retrieve for every object  symbol  in the database, a sorted list of the other objects according to their distance to  symbol
OWNX	we call the position of object  symbol  in this list the  rank  of  symbol  with respect to  symbol , and denote it by  symbol
MISC	how much does the fact that the rank of some object  symbol  w r t
MISC	some other object  symbol  is  symbol , and the rank of  symbol  w r t
MISC	symbol  is  symbol  tell us about the rank of  symbol  w r t
MISC	symbol
OWNX	we develop a randomized hierarchical scheme that improves the existing bounds for nearest neighbor search based on a similarity oracle (see section )
OWNX	we also prove, as far as we know, the first lower bound on the average number of questions to be asked for randomized nearest-neighbor search in this setup (see section )
OWNX	building on this intuition, we introduce the notion of  rank-sensitive hashing  (rsh) in section
MISC	the hash function itself does not require any characterization of the subjacent space as an input
OWNX	however, the smallest value of  symbol  we can choose depends on the rank distortion
OWNX	in general, both the criteria (combinatorial disorder and rank distortion) we use to characterize the hidden space seem to capture how ``homogeneous'' that space is
OWNX	we apply this idea of rsh to nn search, but we believe that this might be useful in other scenarios as well
OWNX	we describe the median  symbol -flats (mkf) algorithm, a simple online method for hybrid linear modeling, ie , for approximating data by a mixture of flats
MISC	this algorithm simultaneously partitions the data into clusters while finding their corresponding best approximating  symbol   symbol -flats, so that the cumulative  symbol  error is minimized
MISC	it requires a negligible amount of storage, and its complexity, when modeling data consisting of  symbol  points in  symbol  with  symbol   symbol -dimensional linear subspaces, is of order  symbol , where  symbol  is the number of iterations required for convergence (empirically on the order of  symbol )
MISC	since it is an online algorithm, data can be supplied to it incrementally and it can incrementally produce the corresponding output
MISC	many common data sets can be modeled by mixtures of flats (i e , affine subspaces)
MISC	for example, feature vectors of different moving objects in a video sequence lie on different affine subspaces (see eg ,  citation ), and similarly, images of different faces under different illuminating conditions are on different linear subspaces with each such subspace corresponding to a distinct face~ citation
MISC	such data give rise to the problem of hybrid linear modeling, i e , modeling data by a mixture of flats
MISC	different kinds of algorithms have been suggested for this problem utilizing different mathematical theories
MISC	for example, generalized principal component analysis (gpca)~ citation  is based on algebraic geometry, agglomerative lossy compression (alc)~ citation  uses information theory, and spectral curvature clustering (scc)~ citation  uses multi-way clustering methods as well as multiscale geometric analysis
MISC	on the other hand, there are also some heuristic approaches, eg , subspace separation~ citation  and local subspace affinity (lsa)~ citation
MISC	probably, the most straightforward method of all is the  symbol -flats (kf) algorithm or any of its variants~ citation
MISC	the  symbol -flats algorithm aims to partition a given data set  symbol  into  symbol  subsets  symbol , each of which is well approximated by its best fit  symbol -flat
MISC	in practice, the minimization of this function is performed iteratively as in the  symbol -means algorithm~ citation
MISC	that is, after an initialization of  symbol   symbol -flats (for example, they may be chosen randomly), one repeats the following two steps until convergence: 1) assign clusters according to minimal distances to the flats determined at the previous stage 2) compute least squares  symbol -flats for these newly obtained clusters by principal component analysis (pca)
MISC	this procedure is very fast and is guaranteed to converge to at least a local minimum
MISC	however, in practice, the local minimum it converges to is often significantly worse than the global minimum
MISC	as a result, the  symbol -flats algorithm is not as accurate as more recent hybrid linear modeling algorithms, and even in the case of underlying linear subspaces (as opposed to general affine subspaces) it often fails when either  symbol  is sufficiently large (e g ,  symbol ) or there is a large component of outliers
OWNX	we believe that an online procedure, which has to be very different than  symbol -flats, can also be beneficial for standard settings of moderate-size data which is not streaming
MISC	indeed, it is possible that such a strategy will converge more often to the global minimum of the  symbol  error than the straightforward  symbol  generalization of  symbol -flats (assuming an accurate algorithm for computing best  symbol  flats)
MISC	the mkf algorithm employs a stochastic gradient descent strategy~ citation  in order to provide an online approximation for the best  symbol   symbol -flats
MISC	its current implementation only applies to the setting of underlying linear subspaces (and not general affine ones)
MISC	even on the hopkins 155 database for motion segmentation~ citation , which requires small intrinsic dimensions, has little noise, and few outliers, the mkf performs very well and in particular better than  symbol -flats
OWNX	in section~ we introduce the mkf algorithm
OWNX	section~ carefully tests the algorithm on both artificial data of synthetic hybrid linear models and real data of motion segmentation in video sequences
OWNX	section~ concludes with a brief discussion and mentions possibilities for future work
OWNX	ensemble learning aims to improve generalization ability by using multiple base learners
MISC	it is
MISC	 as  diverse
OWNX	 helping augment the diversity among the base learners
MISC	specifically, a semi-supervised ensemble
MISC	 error-prone  pseudo-labels  are estimated for unlabeled data to enlarge the labeled data to
OWNX	 improve accuracy, {\udeed} works by maximizing accuracies of base learners on labeled data while
MISC	 maximizing diversity among them on unlabeled data
MISC	 utilize unlabeled data for ensemble learning and is highly competitive to well-established
MISC	 semi-supervised ensemble methods
MISC	numerous effective ensemble
MISC	 methods have been proposed, such as \textsc{boosting}  citation , \textsc{bagging}  citation ,
MISC	 \textsc{stacking}  citation , etc , and most of these methods work under the supervised setting
MISC	 where the labels of training examples are known
MISC	in many real-world tasks, however, unlabeled
MISC	 training examples are readily available while obtaining their labels would be fairly expensive
MISC	semi-supervised learning   citation  is a major paradigm to exploit unlabeled data together
MISC	 with labeled training data to improve learning performance automatically, without human
MISC	 intervention
MISC	in contrast to the huge volume of literatures on ensemble learning and on
MISC	 semi-supervised learning, only a few work has been devoted to the study of semi-supervised
MISC	as indicated by zhou  citation , this was caused by the different philosophies of
MISC	the ensemble learning
MISC	 community believes that it is able to boost the performance of weak learners to strong learners by
MISC	 using multiple learners, and so there is no need to use unlabeled data; while the semi-supervised
MISC	 learning community believes that it is able to boost the performance of weak learners to strong
MISC	 learners by exploiting unlabeled data, and so there is no need to use multiple learners
MISC	however,
MISC	 as zhou indicated  citation , there are several important reasons why ensemble learning and
OWNX	 considering unlabeled data it is possible to help augment the  diversity  among the base
MISC	it is well-known that the generalization error of an ensemble is related to the average
OWNX	 generalization error of the base learners and the diversity among the base learners
MISC	generally, the
OWNX	 lower the average generalization error (or, the higher the average accuracy) of the base learners
MISC	previous
MISC	 high diversity by using the labeled training set
MISC	 accuracy and a high diversity may suffer from a dilemma
MISC	for example, for two classifiers which
MISC	 have perfect performance on the labeled training set, they would not have diversity since there is
MISC	 no difference between their predictions on the training examples
MISC	thus, to increase the diversity
OWNX	however, when we have unlabeled data, we might
MISC	this would
MISC	 be important for ensemble design
MISC	 will be no difference taking either the ensemble consisting of  symbol  or the ensemble consisting
OWNX	 while  symbol  and  symbol  make different predictions on some unlabeled data, then we will know that the
MISC	 ensemble consisting of  symbol  should be better
MISC	so, in contrast to previous ensemble methods
MISC	 approach
MISC	 achieves much better performance than its counterpart which does not consider the usefulness of
MISC	 state-of-the-art semi-supervised ensemble methods
OWNX	section  briefly reviews related work
OWNX	section  presents {\udeed}
OWNX	section 
OWNX	 reports our experimental results
OWNX	finally, section  concludes
OWNX	we propose a randomized algorithm for   training support vector machines(svms) on large datasets
OWNX	by using ideas from random projections we show that  the combinatorial dimension of svms is  symbol  with high probability
OWNX	the algorithm has probabilistic guarantees and is  capable of training svms  with kernels for both classification and regression problems
OWNX	experiments done on synthetic and real life data sets demonstrate that the algorithm scales up  existing svm learners, without loss of accuracy \keywords{support vector machines,  randomized algorithms, random projections} \subclass{68w20 90c25 90c06 90c90 }
MISC	consider a training data set  symbol  where  symbol  are data points and  symbol  are labels
MISC	the problem of learning a linear classifier,  symbol ,  where  symbol  or a linear function  symbol  when  symbol  is a scalar  can be understood as estimating  symbol  from  symbol
MISC	for a  detailed review of svm classification and svm regression please see  citation
OWNX	to develop notation we briefly discuss the problem of training linear classifiers
MISC	the svm formulation for linearly separable datasets is given by  citation    symbol }  where  symbol , is the euclidean norm of  symbol
MISC	the formulation has very interesting geometric underpinnings  ~ citation
MISC	it can be understood as computing the distance between convex  hulls of the sets  symbol  and  symbol
MISC	for linearly non-separable datasets the following formulation \\     c-svm-1:  \\  symbol } which will be called  symbol , again due to  citation , can be used
MISC	this  formulation do not have an elegant geometric interpretation like the separable  case,  but one can consider c-svms as computing the distance between two  reduced convex hulls ~ citation
MISC	both the formulations are instances of  abstract optimization problem(aop) ~ citation
MISC	an aop is defined as follows:  every aop has a  combinatorial dimension associated  with it; the combinatorial dimension captures the notion of number of free variables for that aop
MISC	an aop can be solved by a randomized algorithm by selecting subsets of size greater than the combinatorial dimension of the problem~ citation
OWNX	we wish to exploit this property  of aops to design randomized algorithms for svms
MISC	the idea is to develop an iterative algorithm where in each step one needs  to solve a svm formulation on a small subset of the training data
MISC	crucial  to this idea is the size of the subset which is tied to the combinatorial  dimension of the svm formulation
MISC	the parameter  symbol  does not change with number of examples  symbol , and is often much less than  symbol
MISC	apriori the value of  symbol  is not known, but for linearly separable classification problems the following holds:  symbol
MISC	this follows from the observation that  it computes the distance between 2 non-overlapping convex hulls~ citation
MISC	when the problem is not linearly separable, the reduced convex hull interpretation leads to a very crude upper bound, which is much larger than  symbol
MISC	the idea of iterating over randomly sampled subsets of size greater than   symbol , for training svms was first explored by  ~ citation , and  the resulting algorithm was called randsvm
MISC	the  randsvm procedure iterates over subsets of size proportional to  symbol  , as shown in algorithm~
MISC	however as the authors noted that randsvm is not practical because of the following reasons
MISC	for non-linear svms ~ citation   the dimension of feature space is usually unknown when using kernels
MISC	even in this case one can obtain a very crude  upper-bound on  symbol  by the reduced convex hull approach but  is not really useful as the number obtained is very large \end{algorithm}  this work overcomes the above problems using ideas from random projections~ citation  and randomized algorithms~ citation
MISC	as mentioned by the authors of randsvm, the biggest bottleneck in their algorithm is the value of  symbol  as it is too large
MISC	almost separable data sets are those which become linearly separable when a small number of properly chosen data points are deleted from them
MISC	the second contribution is an algorithm which, using ideas from randomized algorithms for linear programming(lp), solves the svm problem by using samples of size linear in  symbol
MISC	this work also shows that the theory can be applied to non-linear kernels
OWNX	section~ presents the improved algorithm for the  symbol tube regression formulation
OWNX	we present our results  and conclusions in section~ and ~
MISC	the minimum description length (mdl) principle selects the model that has the shortest code for data plus model
MISC	no independence, ergodicity, stationarity, identifiability, or other assumption on the model class need to be made
MISC	the  minimum description length  (mdl) principle recommends to use, among competing models, the one that allows to compress the data+model most  citation
MISC	the better the compression, the more regularity has been detected, hence the better will predictions be
MISC	the mdl principle can be regarded as a formalization of ockham's razor, which says to select the simplest model consistent with the data
OWNX	we consider sequential prediction problems, i e \ having  observed sequence   symbol ,  predict   symbol , then observe  symbol  for  symbol
MISC	an infamous problem in this category is the black raven paradox  citation : having observed  symbol  black ravens, what is the likelihood that  all  ravens are black
OWNX	see section  for these and other applications
MISC	let  symbol  be a  countable class of models =\linebreak[1]theories=\linebreak[1]hypotheses=\linebreak[1]probabilities over sequences  symbol , sorted w r t \ to their  complexity=codelength   symbol  (say), containing the  unknown true sampling distribution   symbol
OWNX	our main result will be for arbitrary measurable spaces  symbol , but to keep things simple in the introduction, let us illustrate mdl for finite  symbol
OWNX	in this case, we define  symbol  as the  symbol -probability of data sequence  symbol
MISC	since  symbol  is sampled from  symbol , this code is optimal (shortest among all prefix codes)
OWNX	since we do not know  symbol , we could select the  symbol  that leads to the shortest code on the observed data  symbol
MISC	hence  symbol  can be coded in  symbol  bits
MISC	mdl selects as model the minimizer \mdl^x \;:=\; \arg\min_{q\in\m}\{-q(x)+k(q)\}  given  symbol , the true predictive probability of  symbol  is  symbol
OWNX	since  symbol  is unknown we use  symbol  as a substitute
OWNX	our main concern is how close is the latter to the former
MISC	it is easy to see that  symbol  is monotone increasing and that  symbol  is twice the total variation distance (tvd) defined in \req{tvd}
MISC	mdl is closely related to bayesian prediction, so a comparison to existing results for bayes is interesting
MISC	bayesians use  symbol  for prediction, where  symbol  is the bayesian mixture with prior weights  symbol  and  symbol
MISC	a natural choice is  symbol
MISC	the following results can be shown {\sum_{\l=0}^\e[d_h(p,\mdl^x|x_{1:\l})] 21\,h\ \cdot\ 2^{k(p)},\sum_{\l=0}^\e[d_h(p,\bayes|x_{1:\l})] h\ \cdot\
MISC	w_p^{-1},} {d_\infty(p,\mdl^x|x) 0 d_\infty(p,\bayes|x)0 }  \;\;\left\{ {\mbox{almost surely} \mbox{for}\;\; \l(x)\ \to\ \infty} \right
MISC	where the expectation  symbol  is w r t \  symbol
MISC	the left statements for  symbol  imply  symbol  almost surely, including some form of convergence rate
MISC	for bayes it has been proven in  citation ; for mdl the proof in  citation  can be adapted
MISC	as far as asymptotics is concerned, the right results  symbol  are much stronger, and require more sophisticated proof techniques
MISC	for bayes, the result follows from  citation
MISC	so existing results for discrete mdl are far less satisfactory than the elegant bayesian prediction in tvd
MISC	no independence, ergodicity, stationarity, identifiability, or other assumption need to be made
MISC	the bulk of previous results for mdl are for continuous model classes  citation
MISC	much has been shown for classes of independent identically distributed ( iid  ) random variables  citation
MISC	for instance, asymptotic consistency has been shown in  citation
MISC	indeed, it can be used, but the question is wether this is any good
MISC	there are some results supporting this claim, eg \ if  symbol  is in the closure of  symbol , but similar results exist for bayes
MISC	essentially  symbol  needs to be at least close to some  symbol  for mdl to work, and there are interesting environments that are not even close to being stationary-ergodic or  iid 
MISC	non- iid  \ data is pervasive  citation ; it includes all time-series prediction problems like weather forecasting and stock market prediction  citation
MISC	indeed, these are also perfect examples of non-ergodic processes
MISC	too much green house gases, a massive volcanic eruption, an asteroid impact, or another world war could change the climate/economy irreversibly
MISC	life is also not ergodic; one inattentive second in a car can have irreversible consequences
OWNX	also stationarity is easily violated in multi-agent scenarios: an environment which itself contains a learning agent is non-stationary (during the relevant learning phase)
MISC	extensive games and multi-agent reinforcement learning are classical examples  citation
MISC	for non-ergodic environments, asymptotic distinguishability can depend on the realized observations, which prevent a prior reduction or partitioning of  symbol
MISC	even if principally possible, it can be practically burdensome to do so, eg \ in the presence of approximate symmetries
MISC	indeed this problem is the primary reason for considering  predictive  mdl
OWNX	mdl might never identify the true distribution, but our main result shows that the sequentially selected models become predictively indistinguishable
OWNX	the countability of  symbol  is the severest restriction of our result
MISC	alternatively,  symbol  could be reduced to a countable class by considering only computable parameters  symbol
OWNX	essentially all interesting model classes contain such a countable topologically dense subset
MISC	under certain circumstances mdl still works for the non-computable parameters  citation
MISC	alternatively one may simply reject non-computable parameters on philosophical grounds  citation
OWNX	the formal development starts with section , which introduces notation and our main result
OWNX	the proof for finite  symbol  is presented in section  and for denumerable  symbol  in section
OWNX	in section  we show how the result can be applied to sequence prediction, classification and regression, discriminative learning, and reinforcement learning
OWNX	section  discusses some mdl variations
OWNX	we propose a simple approximated method that can be tuned, trading speed for accuracy according to the task at hand
OWNX	our approach is asynchronous, and therefore suitable for clusters of heterogenous machines
MISC	very large datasets are becoming increasingly common -- from specific collections, such as reuters and pubmed, to very broad and large ones, such as the images and metadata of sites like flickr, scanned books of sites like google books and the whole internet content itself
MISC	topic models, such as latent dirichlet allocation (lda), have proved to be a useful tool to model such collections, but suffer from scalability limitations
MISC	even though there has been some recent advances in speeding up inference for such models, this still remains a fundamental open problem
OWNX	we show robustness of our method to noise with a strong geometric convergence rate even for noisy measurements
OWNX	our results improve upon a recent breakthrough by recht, fazel and parillo  citation  and lee and bresler  citation  in three significant ways: 1) our method ( symbol ) is significantly simpler to analyze and easier to implement, 2) we give recovery guarantees under strictly weaker isometry assumptions 3) we give geometric convergence guarantees for   symbol  and, as demonstrated empirically,  symbol  is significantly faster on real-world and synthetic problems
MISC	however, the affine constraints defining the matrix-completion problem do not obey the {restricted isometry property} in general
OWNX	we empirically demonstrate that our algorithm recovers low-rank {incoherent} matrices from an almost optimal number of uniformly sampled entries
MISC	unfortunately, armp is np-hard in general and is also np-hard to approximate ( citation )
MISC	until recently, most known methods for  symbol  were heuristic in nature with few known rigorous guarantees
MISC	the most commonly used heuristic for the problem is to assume a factorization of  symbol  and optimize the resulting non-convex problem by alternating minimization  citation , alternative projections  citation  or alternating lmis  citation
MISC	another common approach is to relax the rank constraint to a convex function such as the trace-norm or the log determinant  citation ,  citation
MISC	however, most of these methods do not have any optimality guarantees
MISC	recently, meka et al citation  proposed online learning based methods for armp
MISC	however, their methods can only guarantee at best a logarithmic approximation for the minimum rank
MISC	in a recent breakthrough, recht et al ~ citation  obtained the first nontrivial exact-recovery results for  symbol  obtaining guaranteed rank minimization for affine transformations  symbol  that satisfy a {restricted isometry property} ( symbol )
MISC	define the isometry constant of  symbol ,  symbol  to be the smallest number such that for all  symbol  of rank at most  symbol ,   symbol }  recht et al ~show that for affine constraints with bounded isometry constants (specifically,  symbol ), finding the minimum trace-norm solution recovers the minimum rank solution
MISC	their results were later extended to noisy measurements and isometry constants up to  symbol  by lee and bresler  citation
MISC	however, even the best existing optimization algorithms for the trace-norm relaxation are relatively inefficient in practice and their results are hard to analyze
MISC	in another recent work, lee and bresler  citation  obtained exact-recovery guarantees for  symbol  satisfying  symbol  using a different approach
MISC	they also prove similar guarantees for noisy measurements and provide a geometric convergence rate for their algorithm
OWNX	we present a simple analysis showing that  symbol  recovers the minimum rank solution for affine constraints that satisfy  symbol  even in the presence of noise and prove the following guarantees
MISC	however, their analysis and formulation is different from ours
MISC	symbol  is considerably simpler to analyze than the methods of recht et al ~and lee and bresler
MISC	symbol  has a strong geometric convergence rate and is faster than using the best trace-norm optimization algorithms and the methods of lee and bresler by an order of magnitude
MISC	one such important problem where  symbol  does not hold directly is the low-rank matrix completion problem
MISC	recently, a lot of attention has been given to the problem  due to the netflix challenge  citation
MISC	other applications of matrix completion include triangulation from incomplete data, link prediction in social networks etc
MISC	similar to  symbol , the low-rank matrix completion is also np-hard in general and most methods are heuristic in nature with no theoretical guarantees
MISC	the alternating least squares minimization heuristic and its variants  citation  perform the best in practice but are notoriously hard to analyze
MISC	recently, candes and recht  citation , candes and tao  citation  and keshavan et al ~ citation  obtained the first non-trivial results for low-rank matrix completion under a few additional assumptions
MISC	broadly, these papers give exact-recovery guarantees when the optimal solution  symbol  is  symbol -{incoherent} (see definition ), and the entries  symbol  are chosen uniformly at random with  symbol , where  symbol  depends only on  symbol
MISC	however, the algorithms of the above papers, even when using methods tailored specifically for matrix-completion such as those of cai et al ~ citation , are quite expensive in practice and not very tolerant to noise
OWNX	as low-rank matrix completion is a special case of  symbol , we can naturally adapt our algorithm  symbol  for matrix completion
OWNX	we demonstrate empirically that for a suitable step-size,  symbol  significantly outperforms the methods of  citation ,  citation ,  citation ,  citation  in accuracy, computational time and tolerance to noise
OWNX	we prove that though the affine constraints defining the matrix-completion problems do not obey the restricted isometry property, they obey the restricted isometry property over incoherent matrices
OWNX	we also provide strong empirical evidence supporting our hypothesis bounding the incoherence of the iterates of  symbol  (see figure ) }  we first present our algorithm  symbol  in section~ and present its analysis for affine constraints satisfying  symbol  in section~
OWNX	in section~, we specialize our algorithm  symbol  to the task of low-rank matrix completion and prove a more restricted isometry property for the matrix completion problem
OWNX	in section~, we give empirical results for  symbol  applied to  symbol  and matrix-completion on real-world and synthetic problems
MISC	sampling-based methods have previously been proposed for the problem of finding interesting associations in data, even for low-support items
MISC	while these methods do not guarantee precise results, they can be vastly more efficient than approaches that rely on exact counting
MISC	however, for many similarity measures no such methods have been known
OWNX	we demonstrate theoretically that our method is superior to exact methods when the threshold for ``interesting similarity/confidence'' is above the average pairwise similarity/confidence, and the average support is not too low
OWNX	our method is particularly good when transactions contain many items
OWNX	we confirm in experiments on standard association mining benchmarks that this gives a significant speedup on real data sets (sometimes much larger than the theoretical guarantees)
MISC	reductions in computation time of over an order of magnitude, and significant savings in space, are observed
MISC	a central task in data mining is finding associations in a binary relation
MISC	typically, this is phrased in a ``market basket'' setup, where there is a sequence of baskets (from now on ``transactions''), each of which is a set of items
MISC	the goal is to find patterns such as ``customers who buy diapers are more likely to also buy beer''
MISC	there is no canonical way of defining whether an association is interesting --- indeed, this seems to depend on problem-specific factors not captured by the abstract formulation
OWNX	we refer to~ citation  for general background and discussion of similarity measures
OWNX	in the discussion we limit ourselves to the problem of binary associations, i e , patterns involving pairs of items
MISC	there is a large literature considering the challenges of finding patterns involving larger item sets, taking into account the aspect of time, multiple-level rules, etc
OWNX	while some of our results can be extended to cover larger item sets, we will for simplicity concentrate on the binary case
MISC	previous methods rely on one of the following approaches:     identifying item pairs  symbol  that ``occur frequently together'' in the transactions --- in particular, this means counting the number of co-occurrences of each such pair ---  or   computing a ``signature'' for each item such that the similarity of every pair of items can be estimated by (partially) comparing the item signatures
OWNX	our approach is different from both these approaches, and generally offers improved performance and/or flexibility
OWNX	in some sense we go directly to the desired result, which is the set of pairs of items with similarity measure above some user-defined threshold  symbol
OWNX	our method is  sampling\/  based, which means that the output may contain false positives, and there may be false negatives
OWNX	the main focus in many previous association mining papers has been on  space usage\/  and the number of  passes\/  over the data set, since these have been recognized as main bottlenecks
MISC	this is true in particular if data resides in ram, or on a modern ssd that is able to deliver data at a rate of more than a gigabyte per second
MISC	however, as observed in~ citation  this means that potentially interesting or useful associations (e g ~correlations between genes and rare diseases) are not reported
OWNX	in the following sections we first discuss the need for focusing on cpu time in data mining, and then elaborate on the relationship between our contribution and related works
MISC	suppose the signal  symbol  is realized by driving a  symbol -sparse signal  symbol  through an arbitrary unknown stable discrete-linear time invariant system  symbol , namely,  symbol , where  symbol  is the impulse response of the operator  symbol
MISC	these types of processes arise naturally in reflection seismology
OWNX	we develop novel  symbol  minimization methods to solve both cases and establish sufficient conditions for exact recovery for the case when the unknown system  symbol  is auto-regressive (i e all pole) of a known order
MISC	in the compressed sensing/sampling setting it turns out that both  symbol  and  symbol  can be reconstructed from  symbol  measurements under certain technical conditions on the support structure of  symbol
OWNX	we develop a novel lp optimization algorithm and show that both the unknown filter  symbol  and the sparse input  symbol  can be reliably estimated
OWNX	the proof of theorem  can be found in section
OWNX	to help the reader understand the main idea of the proof we first consider a very simple case and section  provides the proof for the general case
OWNX	section  addresses the blind-deconvolution problem, which can be regarded as a noisy version of our problem
OWNX	we use lasso to solve this problem and the detailed proof is provided in section
OWNX	in section , we extend the our techniques to two related problem, namely, decoding of arma process and decoding of a non-causal ar process
OWNX	finally, simulation results are shown in section
MISC	this implies the dynamics evolve in a  symbol -dimensional subspace, while the shape of the set of predictive distributions is determined by  symbol
MISC	latent state belief is represented with a  symbol -dimensional state vector and inference is carried out entirely in  symbol , making rr-hmms as computationally efficient as  symbol -state hmms yet more expressive
OWNX	the algorithm is consistent and free of local optima, and we extend its performance guarantees to cover the rr-hmm case
OWNX	we show how this algorithm can be used in conjunction with a kernel density estimator to efficiently model high-dimensional multivariate continuous data
OWNX	we also relax the assumption that single observations are sufficient to disambiguate state, and extend the algorithm accordingly
MISC	experiments on synthetic data and a toy video, as well as on a difficult robot vision modeling problem, yield accurate models that compare favorably with standard alternatives in simulation quality and prediction capability
MISC	models of stochastic discrete-time dynamical systems have important applications in a wide range of fields
MISC	hidden markov models (hmms)~ citation  and  gaussian linear dynamical systems (ldss)~ citation  are two examples of  latent variable models  of dynamical systems, which  assume that sequential data points are noisy, incomplete observations of a latent state that evolves over time
MISC	hmms model this latent state as a discrete variable, and represent belief as a discrete distribution over states
MISC	the distributional assumptions of hmms and ldss also result in important differences in the evolution of their belief over time
MISC	the joint predictive distribution over observations is allowed to be non-log-concave when predicting or simulating the future, leading to what we call  competitive inhibition  between states (see figure~ below for an example)
MISC	competitive inhibition denotes the ability of a model's predictive distribution to place probability mass on observations while disallowing mixtures of those observations
MISC	conversely, the gaussian joint predictive distribution over observations in ldss is log-concave, and thus does not exhibit competitive inhibition
OWNX	the dichotomy between the two models hinders our ability to compactly model systems that exhibit  both  competitive inhibition and smooth state evolution
OWNX	we present the reduced-rank hidden markov model (rr-hmm), a smoothly evolving dynamical model with the ability to represent nonconvex predictive distributions by relating discrete-state and continuous-state models
MISC	however, inference and learning in such a model is highly inefficient due to the large number of parameters, and due to the fact that existing hmm learning algorithms, such as expectation maximization (em)~ citation , are prone to local minima
MISC	rr-hmms allow us to reap many of the benefits of large-state-space hmms without incurring the associated inefficiency during inference and learning
OWNX	indeed, we show that all inference operations in the rr-hmm can be carried out in the low-dimensional space where the dynamics evolve, decoupling their computational cost from the number of hidden states
MISC	though the rr-hmm is in itself novel, its low-dimensional  symbol  representation is related to existing models such as predictive state representations (psrs)~ citation , observable operator models (ooms)~ citation , generalized hmms~ citation , and weighted automata~ citation , as well as the the representation of ldss learned using subspace identification~ citation
OWNX	these and other related models and algorithms are discussed further in section~
MISC	however, the original algorithm and its bounds assume (1) that the transition model is full-rank and (2) that single observations are informative about the entire latent state, i e \@   symbol -step observability
OWNX	we show how to generalize the hkz bounds to the low-rank transition matrix case and derive tighter bounds that depend on  symbol  instead of  symbol , allowing us to learn rank- symbol  rr-hmms of arbitrarily large  symbol  in  symbol  time, where  symbol  is the number of samples
OWNX	we also describe and test a method for circumventing the  symbol -step observability condition by combining observations to make them more informative
OWNX	experiments show that our learning algorithm can recover the underlying rr-hmm in a variety of synthetic domains
OWNX	we also demonstrate that rr-hmms are able to compactly model smooth evolution  and  competitive inhibition in a clock pendulum video, as well as in real-world mobile robot vision data captured in an office building
MISC	robot vision data (and, in fact, most real-world multivariate time series data) exhibits smoothly evolving dynamics requiring multimodal predictive beliefs, for which rr-hmms are particularly suited
OWNX	when two words have a high  degree of attributional similarity, we call them  synonyms
MISC	for example, the word pair mason:stone is analogous  to the pair carpenter:wood
MISC	lra has potential applications in many  areas, including information extraction, word sense disambiguation,   and information retrieval
MISC	recently the vector space model (vsm) of information  retrieval has been adapted to measuring relational similarity,  achieving a score of 47\% on a collection of 374 college-level multiple-choice  word analogy questions
MISC	in the vsm approach, the relation between a pair of words is  characterized by a vector of frequencies of predefined patterns in a large corpus
MISC	lra extends the vsm approach in three ways: (1) the patterns are derived automatically  from the corpus, (2) the singular value decomposition (svd) is used to smooth the frequency  data, and (3) automatically generated synonyms are used to explore variations of the  word pairs
MISC	lra achieves 56\% on the 374 analogy questions, statistically equivalent to the  average human score of 57\%
MISC	on the related problem of classifying semantic relations, lra  achieves similar gains over the vsm
OWNX	when two words have a high degree of attributional  similarity, we call them  synonyms
OWNX	when two word  pairs  have a high  degree of relational similarity, we say they are  analogous
MISC	verbal analogies are often written in the form  a:b::c:d\/ ,  meaning  a is to b as c is to d ; for example,  traffic:street::water:riverbed
MISC	there is a high degree of relational similarity between the word pair traffic:street and the word pair water:riverbed
MISC	in fact, this analogy is the basis of several mathematical theories of  traffic flow  citation
OWNX	in section~, we look more closely at the connections between attributional and relational similarity
MISC	in analogies such as mason:stone::carpenter:wood, it seems that  relational similarity can be reduced to attributional similarity,  since mason and carpenter are attributionally similar, as are stone  and wood
MISC	street and riverbed are only moderately attributionally similar
MISC	many algorithms have been proposed for measuring the attributional  similarity between two words   citation
MISC	measures of attributional similarity have been studied   extensively, due to their applications in problems such as recognizing synonyms  citation ,  information retrieval  citation , determining semantic orientation  citation ,  grading student essays  citation , measuring textual cohesion  citation , and word sense disambiguation  citation
MISC	on the other hand, since measures of relational  similarity are not as well developed as  measures of attributional similarity, the potential applications of  relational similarity are not as well known
MISC	many problems that involve semantic relations would benefit from an algorithm for measuring relational similarity
OWNX	we discuss related problems in natural language processing, information retrieval, and information extraction in more detail in section~
MISC	they used a vector of frequencies of patterns in a corpus to represent the relation between a pair of words
OWNX	section~ presents the vsm approach to measuring similarity
OWNX	in section~, we present an algorithm for measuring  relational similarity, which we call latent relational analysis (lra)
MISC	the algorithm learns from a large corpus of unlabeled, unstructured  text, without supervision
OWNX	section~ presents our experimental evaluation  of lra with a collection of 374 multiple-choice word analogy questions  from the sat college entrance exam
MISC	an example of a typical sat question appears in table~
MISC	in the educational testing literature, the first pair  (mason:stone) is called the  stem  of the analogy
MISC	the correct choice is called the  solution  and the incorrect choices are  distractors
MISC	we evaluate lra by testing its ability to select the solution and avoid the distractors
MISC	on these same questions, the vsm attained 47\% }  one application for relational similarity is classifying semantic  relations in noun-modifier pairs  citation
OWNX	in section~, we evaluate the performance of lra  with a set of 600 noun-modifier pairs from \namecite{nastase03}
MISC	the problem is to classify a noun-modifier pair, such as ``laser printer'',  according to the semantic relation between the head noun (printer) and  the modifier (laser)
MISC	the 600 pairs have been manually labeled with 30  classes of semantic relations
MISC	for example, ``laser printer'' is classified  as  instrument ; the printer uses the laser as an instrument for printing
MISC	the 600 pairs are divided into  training and testing sets and a testing pair is classified according  to the label of its single nearest neighbour in the training set
MISC	on the same 600 noun-modifier pairs, the vsm had accuracies of  27 8\% (30-class) and 45 7\% (5-class)  citation
OWNX	we discuss the experimental results, limitations of lra, and future work  in section~ and we conclude in section~
OWNX	we consider a problem of significant practical importance,  namely, the reconstruction of a low-rank data matrix from a small subset of its entries
MISC	this problem appears in many areas such as  collaborative filtering, computer vision and wireless sensor networks
OWNX	we show that in practice  these efficient algorithms can be used to reconstruct real data matrices, as well as randomly generated matrices, accurately
OWNX	we consider the problem of reconstructing an  symbol   low rank matrix  symbol  from a small set of observed entries possibly corrupted by noise
MISC	this problem is of considerable practical interest and has many applications
MISC	one example is collaborative filtering, where users submit rankings  for small subsets of, say, movies, and the goal is  to infer the preference of unrated movies for a recommendation system  citation
MISC	it is believed that the movie-rating matrix is approximately low-rank,  since only a few factors contribute to a user's preferences
MISC	other examples of matrix completion include the problem of inferring  3-dimensional structure from motion  citation  and triangulation from incomplete  data of distances between wireless sensors  citation
MISC	 model-based clustering on large networks
OWNX	our work focuses on two
MISC	 saem algorithm, and the second on variational methods
OWNX	we use the method to decipher the connexion structure of the political
OWNX	we show that our
MISC	 offer a good trade-off between precision and speed, when estimating
MISC	 parameters for mixture distributions in the context of random
MISC	analyzing networks has become an essential part of a number of
MISC	 scientific fields
MISC	examples include such widely differing phenomena as power
OWNX	 work we
MISC	 focus on particular networks which are made of political weblogs
MISC	with
MISC	 of new social network websites like myspace and facebook, the web has
MISC	 an increasing
MISC	 influence on the political debate
MISC	as an example,  citation  showed that
MISC	 blogging played an important role in the political debate of the 2004
MISC	 election
MISC	 their interactions
MISC	 with national mainstream media
OWNX	in this article we propose to uncover
MISC	 the connexion
MISC	 campaign in 2008
MISC	 1870 manually classified
MISC	 nodes are connected if there
MISC	 exists a citation from one to another
MISC	many strategies have been developed to study networks structure and
MISC	 topology
MISC	a distinction can be made between model-free
MISC	 [ citation ;  citation ] and model-based methods, with connexions
MISC	 between parametric and nonparametric models [ citation ]
MISC	among
MISC	 an efficient way to summarize complex networks structures
MISC	the basic
MISC	 idea of these strategies is to model the distribution of connections in
MISC	 the network,
MISC	 connectivity classes which are
MISC	 themselves unknown
MISC	 data, and various modeling
MISC	 strategies have been considered
MISC	 mixture model on dyads that belong
MISC	 to some relational alphabet,  citation  propose a mixture on
MISC	 edges,  citation  consider continuous
MISC	 hidden variables and airoldi et al ( citation ) consider both mixed
OWNX	in this article our concern is not to assess nor to compare the
OWNX	 appropriateness of these different models, but we focus on a computational
MISC	 issue that is shared by most of them
MISC	indeed, even if the modeling
MISC	 strategies are diverse, em like algorithms constitute a common core of the
MISC	 estimation strategy [ citation ;  citation ], and this
MISC	 algorithm is known to be slow to convergence and to be very sensitive
MISC	 to the size of the data set
MISC	this issue should be put into perspective
MISC	 with a new challenge that is inherent to the analysis of network data
MISC	 sets which is the
MISC	 development of optimization strategies with a reasonable speed of
MISC	 execution, and which can deal with networks composed of tens of
MISC	 thousands of nodes, if
MISC	 not more
MISC	to this extent, bayesian strategies are limited, as they may
MISC	 not handle networks with more than a few hundred [ citation ;  citation ] or a few thousand [ citation ],
MISC	 and heuristic-based algorithms may not be satisfactory from the
MISC	 statistical point of view [ citation ]
MISC	variational strategies
MISC	 have been proposed as well [ citation ;  citation ],
MISC	 but they are concerned by the same limitations as em
OWNX	 question we assess in this work is ``how to perform efficient
MISC	 from a computational point of view on very large networks or on
MISC	 networks that grow over time
MISC	 when the data set grows over time
MISC	the application of such strategies
MISC	 to mixture models
MISC	 has been studied by many authors [ citation ;  citation ]
MISC	 include the online  symbol -means algorithm [ citation ]
MISC	more
MISC	 recently,  citation 
MISC	 modeled internet traffic using a recursive em algorithm for the
MISC	 estimation of poisson mixture
MISC	 models
MISC	however, an additional difficulty of mixture models for random
MISC	 graphs is that the computation of
MISC	  symbol , the distribution of the hidden label variables
MISC	  symbol  conditionally
MISC	 on the observation  symbol , cannot be factorized due to conditional dependency
MISC	 [ citation ]
OWNX	in this work we consider two alternative
MISC	 strategies to deal
MISC	 with this issue
MISC	 of  symbol ,
MISC	 leading to a stochastic version of the em algorithm (stochastic
MISC	 approximation em, saem)
MISC	 [ citation ]
MISC	 by  citation  which consists
MISC	 in a mean-field approximation of  symbol
MISC	this strategy has
MISC	 also been proposed by  citation 
OWNX	in this article we begin by describing the blog database from the 2008
OWNX	then we present the mixnet model proposed by  citation , and we
MISC	 compare the model with its principal
MISC	 competitors in terms of modeling strategies
OWNX	we use the  citation  data set for illustration
OWNX	we derive the  online 
MISC	 saem or variational methods
MISC	 methods are very effective in terms of computation time,
MISC	 parameter estimation and clustering efficiency
MISC	these simulations
MISC	 integrate both fixed-size and increasing size networks for which
MISC	 online methods have been designed
OWNX	finally, we uncover the
MISC	 connectivity structure of the 2008 us presidential websphere using the
MISC	knowledge regarding other secondary users' activity is limited due to the distributed nature of the network
MISC	the resulting formulation is thus a dynamic game with incomplete information
MISC	recent studies have shown that despite claims of spectral scarcity, the actual licensed spectrum remains unoccupied for long periods of time~ citation
MISC	thus, cognitive radio (cr) systems have been proposed~ citation  in order to efficiently exploit these spectral holes
MISC	crs or secondary users (sus) are wireless devices that can intelligently monitor and adapt to their environment, hence, they are able to share the spectrum with the licensed primary users (pus), operating whenever the pus are idle
MISC	three key design challenges are active topics of research in cognitive radio networks, namely, distributed implementation, spectral efficiency, and the tradeoff between sensing and spectrum access
MISC	previous studies have tackled various aspects of spectrum sensing and spectrum access
MISC	in  citation , the performance of spectrum sensing, in terms of throughput, is investigated when the sus share their instantaneous knowledge of the channel
MISC	the work in  citation  studies the performance of different detectors for spectrum sensing, while in  citation  spatial diversity methods are proposed for improving the probability of detecting the pu by the sus
MISC	other aspects of spectrum sensing are discussed in  citation  and  citation
MISC	furthermore, spectrum access has also received increased attention, eg ,  citation
MISC	in  citation , a dynamic programming approach is proposed to allow the sus to maximize their channel access time while taking into account a penalty factor from any collision with the pu
MISC	in  citation , the authors model the spectrum access problem as a non-cooperative game, and propose learning algorithms to find the correlated equilibria of the game
MISC	non-cooperative solutions for dynamic spectrum access are also proposed in  citation  while taking into account changes in the sus' environment such as the arrival of new pus, among others
MISC	%in  citation ,  when multiple sus compete for spectral opportunities, the issues of fairness and efficiency arise
MISC	on one hand, it is desirable for an su to access a channel with high availability
MISC	on the other hand, the effective achievable rate of an su decreases when contending with many sus over the most available channel
MISC	consequently, efficiency of spectrum utilization in the system reduces
MISC	therefore, an su should explore transmission opportunities in other channels if available and refrain from transmission in the same channel all the time
MISC	intuitively, diversifying spectrum access in both frequency (exploring more channels) and time (refraining from continuous transmission attempts) would be beneficial to achieving fairness among multiple sus, in that sus experiencing poorer channel conditions are not starved in the long run
AIMX	the objective of this paper is to design a mechanism that enables fair and efficient sharing of spectral resources among sus
MISC	auctioning the spectral opportunities is carried out repeatedly
MISC	at the beginning of each period, each su that wishes to participate in the spectrum access submits a bid to a coordinator based on its view of the channel and past auction history
MISC	knowledge regarding other secondary users' activities is limited due to the distributed nature of the network
MISC	the resulting formulation is thus a dynamic game with incomplete information
MISC	the bidder with the highest bid gains spectrum access
MISC	an su can also choose to stay out (so) of the current round, in which case no entry fee is incurred
MISC	each su decides on local actions with the objective of increasing its long-term cost effectiveness
MISC	as demonstrated through extensive simulations, the proposed distributed scheme outperforms a myopic one-stage algorithm where an su always participates in the spectrum access game in both single channel and multi-channel networks
MISC	a comment is in order on the feasibility of such an auction-based approach to spectrum access in practice
MISC	cognitive pilot channel (cpc) has gained attention as a potential enabler of data-aided mitigation techniques between secondary and primary communication systems as well as a  mechanism to support optimized radio resource and data management across heterogeneous networks
MISC	in cpc, a common control channel is used to provide the information corresponding to the operators, radio access technology and frequencies allocated in a given area
OWNX	we can thus leverage the intelligence of the cpc coordinator and the control channel to solicit bidding and broadcast the outcome of auctions
OWNX	in section~, the system model and terminology are introduced
OWNX	mechanism design of the repeated auction with learning is presented in section~
OWNX	simulation results are given in section~ followed by conclusions and a discussion of future work in section~
MISC	the learning of appropriate distance metrics is a critical problem in image classification and retrieval
OWNX	in this work, we propose a boosting-based technique, termed \boostmetric, for learning a mahalanobis distance metric
MISC	semidefinite programming is sometimes used to enforce this constraint, but does not scale well
MISC	thus uses rank-one positive semidefinite matrices as weak learners within an efficient and scalable boosting-based learning process
MISC	the resulting method is easy to implement, does not require tuning, and can accommodate various types of constraints
MISC	it has been an extensively sought-after goal to learn an appropriate distance metric in image classification and retrieval problems using  simple and efficient  algorithms  citation
MISC	such distance metrics are essential to the effectiveness of many critical algorithms such as  symbol -nearest neighbor ( symbol nn),  symbol -means clustering, and kernel regression, for example
OWNX	we show in this work how a mahalanobis metric is learned from proximity comparisons among triples of training data
MISC	therefore, typically methods for learning a mahalanobis distance result in constrained semidefinite programs
OWNX	we discuss the problem setting as well as the difficulties for learning such a matrix
MISC	if we let  symbol  represent a set of points in  symbol , the training data consist of a set of constraints upon the relative distances between these points,  symbol , where  symbol  measures the distance between  symbol  and  symbol
MISC	it is equivalent to learn a projection matrix  symbol  and  symbol
MISC	constraints such as those above often arise when it is known that  symbol  and  symbol  belong to the same class of data points while  symbol  belong to different classes
MISC	in some cases, these comparison constraints are much easier to obtain than either the class labels or distances between data elements
MISC	for example, in video content retrieval, faces extracted from successive frames at close locations can be safely assumed to belong to the same person, without requiring the individual to be identified
MISC	in web search, the results returned by a search engine are ranked according to the relevance, an ordering which allows a natural conversion into a set of constraints
MISC	the requirement of  symbol  being has led to the development of a number of methods for learning a mahalanobis distance which rely upon constrained semidefinite programing
OWNX	this approach has a number of limitations, however, which we now discuss with reference to the problem of learning a matrix from a set of constraints upon pairwise-distance comparisons
MISC	relevant work on this topic includes  citation  amongst others
MISC	xing  citation  firstly proposed to learn a mahalanobis metric for clustering using convex optimization
MISC	neighborhood component analysis (nca)  citation  and large margin nearest neighbor (lmnn)  citation  learn a metric by maintaining consistency in data's neighborhood and keeping a large margin at the boundaries of different classes
MISC	it has been shown in  citation  that lmnn delivers the state-of-the-art performance among most distance metric learning algorithms
OWNX	instead of using hinge loss in lmnn and psdboost, we use the exponential loss function in order to derive an adaboost-like optimization procedure
OWNX	hence, despite similar purposes, our algorithm differs essentially in the optimization
MISC	in many cases, it is difficult to find a global optimum in the projection matrix  symbol   citation
MISC	reformulation-linearization is a typical technique in convex optimization to relax and convexify the problem  citation
MISC	in metric learning, much existing work instead learns  symbol  for seeking a global optimum, \eg,  citation
MISC	the price is heavy computation and poor scalability: it is not trivial to preserve the semidefiniteness of  symbol  during the course of learning
MISC	standard approaches like interior point newton methods require the hessian, which usually requires  symbol  resources (where  symbol  is the input dimension)
MISC	it could be prohibitive for many real-world problems
MISC	alternative projected (sub-)gradient is adopted in  citation
MISC	the disadvantages of this algorithm are: (1) not easy to implement; (2) many parameters involved; (3) slow convergence
MISC	psdboost  citation  converts the particular semidefinite program in metric learning into a sequence of linear programs (lp's)
MISC	at each iteration of psdboost, an lp needs to be solved as in lpboost, which scales around  symbol  with  symbol  the number of iterations (and therefore variables)
MISC	another problem is that psdboost needs to store all the weak learners (the rank-one matrices) during the optimization
MISC	when the input dimension  symbol  is large, the memory required is proportional to  symbol , which can be prohibitively huge at a late iteration  symbol
OWNX	our proposed algorithm solves both of these problems
OWNX	based on the observation from  citation  that any positive semidefinite matrix can be decomposed into a linear positive combination of trace-one rank-one matrices, we propose for learning a matrix
MISC	the weak learner of is a rank-one matrix as in psdboost
MISC	at each iteration, only the largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector are needed (2) can accommodate various types of constraints
OWNX	we demonstrate learning a mahalanobis metric by proximity comparison constraints (3) like adaboost, does not have any parameter to tune
MISC	no sophisticated optimization techniques such as lp solvers are involved
OWNX	unlike psdboost, we do not need to store all the weak learners
MISC	the  symbol th row of  symbol  is denoted by  symbol  and the  symbol th column  symbol
OWNX	we use  symbol  to indicate that matrix  symbol  is positive semidefinite
OWNX	we show how prior techniques for learning hidden markov models can be adapted to the  quantum generator  model to find that the analogous state of affairs holds: information-theoretically, a polynomial number of samples suffice to approximately identify the distribution, but computationally, the problem is as hard as learning parities with noise, a notorious open question in computational learning theory
MISC	in recent work, wiesner and crutchfield~ citation  introduced  quantum generators  as a formal model of simple quantum mechanical systems
MISC	from this perspective, it is natural to wonder what can be learned about such a simple quantum mechanical system from the sequence of measurement outcomes
MISC	most of the non-asymptotic theoretical work in regression is carried out for the square loss, where estimators can be obtained through closed-form expressions
AIMX	in this paper, we use and extend  tools from the convex optimization literature, namely self-concordant functions, to provide simple extensions of theoretical results for the square loss to the logistic loss
OWNX	we apply the extension techniques to logistic regression with regularization by the  symbol -norm and regularization by the  symbol -norm, showing that new results for binary classification through logistic regression can be easily derived from corresponding results for least-squares regression
MISC	the theoretical analysis of statistical methods is usually greatly simplified when the estimators have   closed-form expressions
MISC	for methods based on the minimization of a certain functional, such as m-estimation methods~ citation , this is true when the function to minimize is quadratic, i e , in the context of regression, for the square loss
MISC	when such loss is used, asymptotic and non-asymptotic results may be derived with classical tools from probability theory (see, eg ,~ citation )
MISC	in the asymptotic regime, this has led to interesting developments and extensions of results from the quadratic case, eg , consistency or asymptotic normality (see, eg ,~ citation )
MISC	however, the situation is different when one wishes to derive non-asymptotic results, i e , results where all constants of the problem are explicit
MISC	indeed, in order to prove results as sharp as for the square loss, much notation and many assumptions have to be introduced regarding second and third derivatives; this makes the derived results much more complicated than the ones for closed-form estimators~ citation
MISC	a similar situation occurs in convex optimization, for the study of newton's method for obtaining solutions of unconstrained optimization problems
OWNX	it is known to be locally quadratically convergent for convex problems
MISC	however, its classical analysis requires cumbersome notations and assumptions regarding second and third-order derivatives~(see, eg ,~ citation )
MISC	this situation was greatly enhanced with the introduction of the notion of  self-concordant functions , i e , functions whose third derivatives are controlled by their second derivatives
MISC	with this tool, the analysis is much more transparent~ citation
OWNX	since the logistic loss is not itself a self-concordant function, we introduce in \mysec{self} a new type of functions with a different control of the third derivatives
OWNX	second, we prove results on the behavior of newton's method which are similar to the ones for self-concordant functions
OWNX	we then apply them in sections~,  and~ to the one-step  newton iterate from the population solution of the corresponding problem (i e ,  symbol  or  symbol -regularized logistic regression)
MISC	this essentially shows that the analysis of logistic regression can be done  non-asymptotically  using the local quadratic approximation of the logistic loss,  without  complex additional assumptions
MISC	since this approximation corresponds to a weighted least-squares problem, results from least-squares regression can thus be naturally extended
OWNX	we first apply in \mysec{l2} the extension technique to regularization by the  symbol -norm, where we consider two settings, a situation  with no assumptions regarding the conditional distribution of the observations, and another one where the model is assumed well-specified and we derive asymptotic expansions of the generalization performance with explicit bounds on remainder terms
OWNX	in \mysec{l1}, we consider regularization by the  symbol -norm and extend two known recent results for the square loss, one on model consistency~ citation  and one on prediction efficiency~ citation
AIMX	the main contribution of this paper is to make these extensions as simple as possible, by allowing the use of non-asymptotic second-order taylor expansions \paragraph{notation }    for  symbol  and  symbol , we  denote by  symbol  the  symbol -norm of  symbol , defined as  symbol
OWNX	we also denote by  symbol  its  symbol -norm
OWNX	we   denote by  symbol  and  symbol  the largest and smallest eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix  symbol
OWNX	we use the notation  symbol  (resp
MISC	symbol )
MISC	for    symbol ,  symbol  denotes the sign of  symbol , defined as  symbol  if  symbol ,  symbol  if  symbol , and  symbol  if  symbol
MISC	for a vector  symbol ,  symbol  denotes the   vector of signs of elements of  symbol
MISC	moreover, given a vector  symbol  and a subset  symbol  of  symbol ,   symbol  denotes the cardinal of the set  symbol ,  symbol  denotes the vector in  symbol  of elements of  symbol  indexed by  symbol
MISC	similarly, for a matrix  symbol ,  symbol   denotes the submatrix of   symbol  composed of elements of  symbol  whose rows are in  symbol  and columns are in  symbol
OWNX	finally, we let denote  symbol  and  symbol  general probability measures and expectations
OWNX	we study the problem of online regression
OWNX	we do not make any assumptions about input vectors or outcomes
OWNX	we prove a theoretical bound on the square loss of ridge regression
OWNX	we also show that bayesian ridge regression can be thought of as an online algorithm competing with all the gaussian linear experts
OWNX	we then consider the case of infinite-dimensional hilbert spaces and prove relative loss bounds for the popular non-parametric kernelized bayesian ridge regression and kernelized ridge regression
OWNX	our main theoretical guarantees have the form of equalities
OWNX	in the online prediction framework we are provided with some input at each step and try to predict an outcome using this input and information from previous steps  citation
MISC	in competitive prediction the learner compares his loss at each step with the loss of any expert from a certain class of experts instead of making statistical assumptions about the data generating process
MISC	experts may follow certain strategies

OWNX	%(this is not an apt name, since ridge regression is also a special case of the aggregating algorithm, corresponding to the logarithmic loss function and learning rate 1; and we will call this algorithm the vovk-azoury-warmuth, or vaw, algorithm, following  citation )
OWNX	in the case when the inputs and outcomes are not restricted in any way, like for our main guarantees, it is possible to prove certain loss bounds for the gradient descent;
MISC	 see  citation
OWNX	section~ describes what we call the bayesian algorithm
OWNX	in section~ we show that bayesian ridge regression is competitive with the experts which take into account the presence of noise in observations
OWNX	in section~ we prove the main theorem
OWNX	section~ describes the case of infinite-dimensional hilbert spaces
OWNX	we consider the problem of reconstructing a low rank  matrix from a small subset of its entries
AIMX	in this paper,  we describe the implementation of an efficient algorithm proposed in  citation ,  based on singular value decomposition followed by local manifold optimization,  for solving the low-rank matrix completion problem
MISC	it has been shown that if the number of revealed entries is large enough,  the output of singular value decomposition gives a good estimate for the original matrix,  so that local optimization reconstructs the correct matrix with high probability
OWNX	we present numerical results which show that  this algorithm can reconstruct the low rank matrix exactly  from a very small subset of its entries
OWNX	we further study the robustness of the algorithm with respect to noise, and its performance on actual collaborative filtering datasets
MISC	this problem is of considerable practical interest and has many applications
MISC	one example is collaborative filtering, where users submit rankings for small subsets of, say, movies, and the goal is to infer the preference of unrated movies for a recommendation system  citation
MISC	it is believed that the movie-rating matrix is approximately low-rank, since only a few factors contribute to a user’s preferences
MISC	other examples of matrix completion include the problem of inferring 3-dimensional structure from motion  citation  and triangulation from incomplete data of distances between wireless sensors, also known as the sensor localization problem  citation ,  citation
OWNX	we propose a novel non-parametric adaptive anomaly detection algorithm for high dimensional data based on score functions derived from nearest neighbor graphs on  symbol -point nominal data
MISC	the resulting anomaly detector is shown to be asymptotically optimal in that it is uniformly most powerful for the specified false alarm level,  symbol , for the case when the anomaly density is a mixture of the nominal and a known density
OWNX	our algorithm is computationally efficient, being linear in dimension and quadratic in data size
MISC	it does not require choosing complicated tuning parameters or function approximation classes and it can adapt to local structure such as local change in dimensionality
OWNX	we demonstrate the algorithm on both artificial and real data sets in high dimensional feature spaces
OWNX	anomaly detection involves detecting statistically significant deviations of test data from nominal distribution
MISC	in typical applications the nominal distribution is unknown and generally cannot be reliably estimated from nominal training data due to a combination of factors such as limited data size and high dimensionality
OWNX	we propose an adaptive non-parametric method for anomaly detection based on score functions that maps data samples to the interval  symbol
OWNX	our score function is derived from a k-nearest neighbor graph (k-nng) on  symbol -point nominal data
OWNX	the efficacy of our method rests upon its close connection to multivariate p-values
MISC	in statistical hypothesis testing, p-value is any transformation of the feature space to the interval  symbol  that induces a uniform distribution on the nominal data
MISC	when test samples with p-values smaller than  symbol  are declared as anomalies, false alarm error is less than  symbol
OWNX	we develop a novel notion of p-values based on measures of level sets of likelihood ratio functions
OWNX	our notion provides a characterization of the optimal anomaly detector, in that, it is uniformly most powerful for a specified false alarm level for the case when the anomaly density is a mixture of the nominal and a known density
OWNX	it is also referred to as novelty detection  citation , outlier detection  citation , one-class classification  citation  and single-class classification  citation  in the literature
OWNX	approaches to anomaly detection can be grouped into several categories
MISC	in parametric approaches~ citation  the nominal densities are assumed to come from a parameterized family and generalized likelihood ratio tests are used for detecting deviations from nominal
MISC	it is difficult to use parametric approaches when the distribution is unknown and data is limited
MISC	there an anomaly is declared whenever the distance to the k-th nearest neighbor of the test sample falls outside a threshold
OWNX	in comparison our anomaly detector utilizes the global information available from the entire k-nn graph to detect deviations from the nominal
MISC	in addition it has provable optimality properties
MISC	learning theoretic approaches attempt to find decision regions, based on nominal data, that separate nominal instances from their outliers
MISC	these include one-class svm of sch symbol lkopf et
MISC	al
MISC	citation  where the basic idea is to map the training data into the kernel space and to separate them from the origin with maximum margin
MISC	other algorithms along this line of research include support vector data description  citation ,  linear programming approach  citation , and single class minimax probability machine  citation
MISC	scott and nowak  citation  derive decision regions based on minimum volume (mv) sets, which does provide type i and type ii error control
OWNX	related work by hero  citation  based on geometric entropic minimization (gem) detects outliers by comparing test samples to the most concentrated subset of points in the training sample
OWNX	this most concentrated set is the  symbol -point minimum spanning tree(mst) for  symbol -point nominal data and converges asymptotically to the minimum entropy set (which is also the mv set)
MISC	to overcome these computational limitations  citation  proposes heuristic greedy algorithms based on leave-one out k-nn graph, which while inspired by  symbol -mst algorithm is no longer provably optimal
OWNX	we develop score functions on k-nng which turn out to be the empirical estimates of the volume of the mv sets containing the test point
OWNX	yet our algorithms lead to statistically optimal solutions with the ability to control false alarm and miss error probabilities
OWNX	we show that for high-dimensional data, a particular framework for learning a linear transformation of the data based on the logdet divergence can be efficiently kernelized to learn a metric (or equivalently, a kernel function) over an arbitrarily high dimensional space
OWNX	we further demonstrate that a wide class of convex loss functions for learning linear transformations can similarly be kernelized, thereby considerably expanding the potential applications of metric learning
OWNX	we demonstrate our learning approach by applying it to large-scale real world problems in computer  vision and text mining
MISC	in many cases, off-the-shelf distance or similarity functions such as the euclidean distance or cosine similarity are used; for example, in text retrieval applications, the cosine similarity is a standard function to compare two text documents
MISC	recently, there has been significant effort focused on learning how to compare data objects
MISC	one approach has been to learn a distance metric between objects given additional side information such as pairwise similarity and dissimilarity constraints over the data
MISC	one class of distance metrics that has shown excellent generalization properties is the  mahalanobis distance  function~ citation
MISC	despite their simplicity and generalization ability, mahalanobis distances suffer from two major drawbacks: 1) the number of parameters grows quadratically with the dimensionality of the data, making it difficult to learn distance functions over high-dimensional data, 2) learning a linear transformation is inadequate for data sets with non-linear decision boundaries
MISC	these methods are restricted to learning in the transductive  setting where all the data (labelled and unlabeled) is assumed to be given upfront
MISC	there has been some work on learning kernels that generalize to new points, most notably work on hyperkernels~ citation , but the resulting optimization problems are expensive and cannot be scaled to large or even medium-sized data sets
MISC	the loss function has precedence in optimization~ citation  and statistics~ citation
OWNX	an important advantage of our method is that the proposed optimization algorithm is scalable to very large data sets of the order of millions of data objects
MISC	but perhaps most importantly, the loss function permits efficient kernelization, allowing the learning of a linear transformation in kernel space
OWNX	as a result, unlike transductive kernel learning methods, our method easily handles out-of-sample extensions, i e , it can be applied to unseen data
OWNX	our result is akin to the representer theorem for reproducing kernel hilbert spaces, where the optimal parameters can be expressed purely in terms of the training data
OWNX	finally, we apply our algorithm to a number of challenging learning problems, including ones from the domains of computer vision and text mining
OWNX	unlike existing  techniques, we can learn linear transformation-based distance   or kernel functions over these domains, and we show that the resulting functions lead to improvements over state-of-the-art techniques for a variety of problems
MISC	wsns  are  a fortiori  designed to make inferences from the environments they are sensing; however they are typically characterized by constraints on energy and bandwidth, which limit the sensors' ability to share data with each other or with a centralized fusion center
MISC	in data mining with distributed databases, multiple agents (e g , corporations) have access to possibly overlapping databases, and wish to collaborate to make optimal inferences; privacy or security concerns, however, may preclude them from fully sharing information
MISC	nonparametric methods studied within machine learning have demonstrated widespread empirical success in many centralized (i e , communication  unconstrained ) signal processing applications
MISC	thus, in both the aforementioned applications, a natural question arises: can the power of machine learning methods be tapped for nonparametric inference in distributed learning under communication constraints
AIMX	in this paper, we address this question by formalizing a general model for distributed learning, and then deriving a distributed algorithm for collaborative training in regularized kernel least-squares regression
MISC	the algorithm can be viewed as an instantiation of successive orthogonal projection algorithms, and thus, insight into the statistical behavior of these algorithms can be gleaned from standard analyses in mathematical programming
MISC	%   <- trailing '%' for backward compatibility of
MISC	sty file given a sample from a probability measure with support on a submanifold in euclidean space one can construct a neighborhood graph which can be seen as an approximation of the submanifold
MISC	the graph laplacian of such a graph is used in several machine learning methods like semi-supervised learning, dimensionality reduction and clustering
OWNX	we show that for a uniform measure on the submanifold all graph laplacians have the same limit up to constants
MISC	however in the case of a non-uniform measure on the submanifold only the so called random walk graph laplacian converges to the weighted laplace-beltrami operator
MISC	in recent years, methods based on graph laplacians have become increasingly popular in machine learning
MISC	they have been used in semi-supervised learning  citation , spectral clustering  citation  and dimensionality reduction  citation
MISC	if the data lies in  symbol  the neighborhood graph built from the random sample can be seen as an approximation of the continuous structure
MISC	in particular,  if the data has support on a low-dimensional submanifold the neighborhood graph is a discrete approximation of the submanifold
MISC	approximations of the laplace-beltrami operator or related objects have been studied for certain special deterministic graphs
MISC	the easiest case is a grid in  symbol
MISC	in numerics it is standard to approximate the laplacian with finite-differences schemes on the grid
MISC	these can be seen as a special instances of a graph laplacian
MISC	there convergence for decreasing grid-size follows easily by an argument using taylor expansions
MISC	another more involved example is the work of  citation , where for a graph generated by an  symbol -packing of a manifold, the equivalence of certain properties of random walks on the graph and brownian motion on the manifold have been established
OWNX	the connection between random walks and the graph laplacian becomes obvious by noting that the graph laplacian as well as the laplace-beltrami operator are the generators of the diffusion process on the graph and the manifold, respectively
MISC	in  citation  the convergence of a discrete approximation of the laplace beltrami operator for a triangulation of a 2d-surface in  symbol  was shown
MISC	in the case where the graph is generated randomly, only first results have been proved so far
MISC	the first work on the large sample limit of graph laplacians has been done by  citation
MISC	in a second step taking the limit of the neighborhoodsize  symbol , they got  symbol  as the effective limit operator in  symbol
MISC	their result has recently been generalized to the submanifold case and uniform convergence over the space of h\"older-functions by  citation
MISC	in  citation , the neighborhoodsize  symbol  was kept fixed while the large sample limit of the graph laplacian was considered
MISC	in this setting, the authors showed strong convergence results of graph laplacians to certain integral operators, which imply the convergence of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
MISC	the main emphasis lies on the case where the data generating measure has support on a submanifold of  symbol
MISC	the bias term, that is the difference between the continuous counterpart of the graph laplacian and the laplacian itself has been studied first for compact submanifolds without boundary by  citation  and  citation  for the gaussian kernel and a uniform data generating measure and was then generalized by  citation  to general isotropic weights and general probability measures
MISC	additionally lafon showed that the use of data-dependent weights for the graph allows to control the influence of the density
MISC	this part was first studied by  citation  and  citation
MISC	in  citation  the convergence was shown for the so called unnormalized graph laplacian in the case of a uniform probability measure on a compact manifold without boundary and using the gaussian kernel for the weights, whereas in  citation  the pointwise convergence was shown for the random walk graph laplacian in the case of general probability measures on non-compact manifolds with boundary using general isotropic data-dependent weights
MISC	more recently  citation  have extended the pointwise convergence for the unnormalized graph laplacian shown by  citation  to uniform convergence on compact submanifolds without boundary giving explicit rates
MISC	in  citation , see also  citation , the rate of convergence given by  citation  has been improved in the setting of the uniform measure
OWNX	in section  we introduce the basic framework necessary to define graph laplacians for general directed weighted graphs and then simplify the general case to undirected graphs
OWNX	in particular,  we define the three graph laplacians used in machine learning so far, which we call the normalized, the unnormalized and the random walk laplacian
OWNX	we also study properties of this limit operator and provide insights why and how this operator can be used for semi-supervised learning, clustering and regression
OWNX	then finally we present the main convergence result for all three graph laplacians and give the conditions on the neighborhood size as a function of the sample size necessary for convergence
OWNX	in section  we illustrate the main result by studying the difference between the three graph laplacians and the effects of different data-dependent weights on the limit operator
OWNX	in section  we prove the main result
OWNX	we introduce a framework for studying non-compact manifolds with boundary and provide the necessary assumptions on the submanifold  symbol , the data generating measure  symbol  and the kernel  symbol  used for defining the weights of the edges
MISC	a central issue is learning these models in high-dimensions, such as when there is some sparsity pattern of the optimal parameter
OWNX	in particular, we show how this property can be used to analyze generic exponential families under  symbol  regularization
MISC	exponential models are perhaps the most versatile and pragmatic statistical model for a variety of reasons --- modelling flexibility (encompassing discrete variables, continuous variables, covariance matrices, time series, graphical models, etc); convexity properties allowing ease of optimization; and robust generalization ability
MISC	a principal issue for applicability to large scale problems is estimating these models when the ambient dimension of the parameters,  symbol , is much larger than the sample size  symbol  --- the `` symbol '' regime
MISC	much recent work has focused on this problem in the special case of linear regression in high dimensions, where it is assumed that the optimal parameter vector is sparse (e g citation )
MISC	this body of prior work focused on: sharply characterizing the convergence rates for the prediction loss; consistent model selection; and obtaining sparse models
OWNX	as we tackle more challenging problems, there is a growing need for model selection in more general exponential families
MISC	recent work here includes learning gaussian graphs ( citation ) and ising models ( citation )
MISC	classical results established that consistent estimation in  general  exponential families is possible, in the asymptotic limit where the number of dimensions is held constant (though some work establishes rates under certain conditions as  symbol  is allowed to grow slowly with  symbol   citation )
MISC	this condition is rather mild, where these moments can grow as fast as  symbol
MISC	interestingly, similar conditions have been well studied for obtaining exponential tail bounds for the convergence of a random variable to its mean~ citation
OWNX	in particular, our analysis draws many parallels to that of the analysis of newton's method, where there is a ``burn in'' phase in which a number of iterations must occur until the function behaves as a locally quadratic function --- in our statistical setting, we now require a (quantified) ``burn in'' sample size, where beyond this threshold sample size, the prediction loss inherits the desired strong convexity properties (i e it is locally quadratic)
OWNX	under a particular sparse eigenvalue condition on the design matrix (the restricted eigenvalue (re) condition in  citation ), we show how  symbol  regularization in general exponential families enjoys a convergence rate of  symbol  (where  symbol  is the number of relevant features)
OWNX	we show that an essentially identical convergence rate can be achieved for  general  exponential families --- our results are non-asymptotic and precisely relate  symbol  and  symbol
OWNX	our final contribution is one of  approximate  sparse model selection, i e where our goal is to obtain a sparse model with low prediction loss
OWNX	for general exponential families, while we do not have a characterization of the sparsity level of the  symbol -regularized solution (an interesting open question), we do however provide a simple two stage procedure (thresholding and refitting) which provides a sparse model, with support on no more than merely  symbol  features and which has nearly as good performance (with a rather mild increase in the risk) --- this result is novel even for the square loss case
OWNX	hence, even under the rather mild re condition, we can obtain both a favorable convergence rate and a  sparse model for generic families
MISC	recent work has shown that the use of meta-features, additional inputs describing each example in a dataset, can boost the performance of ensemble methods, but the greatest reported gains have come from nonlinear procedures requiring significant tuning and training time
OWNX	here, we present a linear technique, feature-weighted linear stacking (fwls), that incorporates meta-features for improved accuracy while retaining the well-known virtues of linear regression regarding speed, stability, and interpretability
OWNX	fwls combines model predictions linearly using coefficients that are themselves linear functions of meta-features
MISC	this technique was a key facet of the solution of the second place team in the recently concluded netflix prize competition
MISC	many machine learning practitioners have had success using stacking and related techniques to boost prediction accuracy beyond the level obtained by any of the individual models
MISC	since its introduction  citation , modellers have employed stacking successfuly on a wide variety of problems, including chemometrics  citation , spam filtering  citation , and large collections of datasets drawn from the uci machine learning repository  citation
MISC	the team  bellkor's pragmatic chaos  won the \$1 million prize using a blend of hundreds of different models  citation
MISC	intuition suggests that the reliability of a model may vary as a function of the conditions in which it is used
OWNX	for instance, in a collaborative filtering context where we wish to predict the preferences of customers for various products, the amount of data collected may vary significantly depending on which customer or which product is under consideration
MISC	model a may be more reliable than model b for users who have rated many products, but model b may outperform model a for users who have only rated a few products
OWNX	such an additional source of information, like the number of products rated by a user or the number of days since a product was released, is often referred to as a ``meta-feature,'' and we will use that terminology here
MISC	the many virtues of linear models are well known to modellers
MISC	the computational cost involved in fitting such models (via the solution of a linear system) is usually modest and always predictable
MISC	they typically require a minimum of tuning
MISC	the transparency of the functional form lends itself naturally to interpretation
MISC	at a minimum, linear models are often an obvious initial attempt against which the performance of more complex models is benchmarked
MISC	unfortunately, linear models do not (at first glance) appear to be well suited to capitalize on meta-features
MISC	if we simply merge a list of meta-features with a list of models to form one overall list of independent variables to be linearly combined by a blending algorithm, then the resulting functional form does not appear to capture the intuition that the relative emphasis given the predictions of various models should depend on the meta-features, since the coefficient associated with each model is constant and unaffected by the values of the meta-features
MISC	previous work has indeed suggested that nonlinear, iteratively trained models are needed to make good use of meta-features for blending
MISC	the winning netflix prize submission of  bellkor's pragmatic chaos  is a complex blend of many sub-blends, and many of the sub-blends use blending techniques which incorporate meta-features
MISC	in  citation , a system called stream (stacking recommendation engines with additional meta-features) which blends recommendation models is presented
MISC	eight meta-features are tested, but the results showed that most of the benefit came from using the number of user ratings and the number of item ratings, which were also two of the most commonly used meta-features by  bellkor's pragmatic chaos
MISC	in a classification problem context  citation , dzeroski and zenko attempt to augment a linear regression stacking algorithm by meta-features such as the entropy of the predicted class probabilities, although they found that it yielded limited benefit on a suite of tasks from the uc irvine machine learning repository
MISC	they present a blending algorithm based on weighted nearest neighbors which changes the weightings assigned to the models depending on estimates of the accuracies of the models within particular subareas of the input space
MISC	thus, a survey of the pre-existing literature suggests that nonparametric or iterative nonlinear approaches are usually required in order to make good use of meta-features when blending
MISC	the method does not simply add meta-features as additional inputs to be regressed against
MISC	the blending approach was an important part of the solution submitted by  the ensemble , the team which finished in second place in the netflix prize competition
OWNX	is this dichotomy universal
OWNX	we prove that the answer is yes: for every metric space, the optimal regret of a lipschitz mab algorithm is either bounded above by any  symbol , or bounded below by any  symbol
OWNX	perhaps surprisingly, this dichotomy does not coincide with the distinction between finite and infinite metric spaces; instead it depends on whether the completion of the metric space is compact and countable
OWNX	our proof connects upper and lower bound techniques in online learning with classical topological notions  such as perfect sets and the cantor-bendixson theorem
OWNX	we also consider the  full-feedback  (a k a ,  best-expert ) version of lipschitz mab problem, termed the  lipschitz experts problem , and show that this problem exhibits a similar dichotomy
OWNX	we proceed to give nearly matching upper and lower bounds on regret in the lipschitz experts problem on uncountable metric spaces
OWNX	to characterize this dependence, we introduce a novel dimensionality notion tailored to the experts problem
MISC	multi-armed bandit (henceforth, mab) problems have been studied for more than fifty years as a clean abstract setting for analyzing the exploration-exploitation tradeoffs that are common in sequential decision making
MISC	in addition to their many applications --- which range from experimental design to online auctions and web advertising --- another appealing feature of multi-armed bandit algorithms is that they are surprisingly efficient in terms of the growth rate of regret: for finite-armed bandit problems, algorithms whose regret at time  symbol  scales as  symbol  have been known for more than two decades, beginning with the seminal work of lai and robbins~ citation  and extended in subsequent work such as~ citation
MISC	many of the applications of mab problems --- especially the computer science applications such as online auctions, web advertising, or adaptive routing --- require considering strategy sets which are very large or even infinite
MISC	indeed, without making any assumptions about the strategies and their payoffs, bandit problems with large strategy sets allow for no non-trivial solutions --- any mab algorithm performs as badly, on some inputs, as random guessing
MISC	this motivates the study of bandit problems in which the strategy set is large but one is given  side information  constraining the form of the payoffs
MISC	such problems have  become the subject of quite intensive study in recent years, eg ~ citation
MISC	this models situations where the decision maker has access to some similarity information about strategies which ensures that similar strategies obtain similar payoffs
MISC	%, with lipschitz constant  symbol
MISC	the lipschitz mab problem was introduced by kleinberg et al ~ citation
MISC	preceding work~ citation  has studied the problem  in a few specific metric spaces such as a one-dimensional real interval
MISC	the prior work considered regret  symbol  as a function of time  symbol , and focused on the asymptotic dependence of  symbol  on, loosely speaking, the dimensionality of the metric space
MISC	in particular, if the metric space is the interval  symbol  with the standard metric  symbol , then there exists an algorithm with regret  symbol , and this bound is tight up to polylog factors~ citation
MISC	more generally, for an arbitrary infinite metric space  symbol  one can define an isometry invariant  symbol  such that there exists an algorithm with regret  symbol , which is tight up to polylog factors if  symbol ; see~ citation
MISC	in fact, for most metric spaces that have been studied (such as the unit interval) this possibility is  excluded  by known lower bounds of the form  symbol  where  symbol  therefore it is natural to ask,    is    symbol  regret the best possible for an infinite metric space
OWNX	% for any metric space \xhdr{our contributions } to make the above issue more concrete, let us put forward the following definition
OWNX	we settle the questions listed above by proving the following dichotomy
MISC	it is worth mentioning that the regret bound  symbol  is the best possible, even for two-armed bandit problems, by a lower bound of lai and robbins~ citation
OWNX	thus our upper bound for lipschitz mab problems in compact, countable metric spaces is nearly the best possible bound for such spaces, modulo the gap between `` symbol " and `` symbol "
OWNX	furthermore, we show that this gap is inevitable for infinite metric spaces:    we turn our attention to the  full-feedback  version of the lipschitz mab problem
MISC	for any mab problem there exists a corresponding  full-feedback  problem in which after each round, the payoffs from all strategies are revealed
MISC	such settings have been extensively studied in the online learning literature under the name  best experts problems ~ citation
MISC	in particular, for a finite set of strategies one can achieve a  constant  regret~ citation  when payoffs are  iid 
MISC	over time
OWNX	in addition to the full feedback, one could also consider a version in which the payoffs are revealed for some but not all strategies
OWNX	specifically, we define the  double feedback , where in each round the algorithm selects two strategies: the ``bet" for which it receives the payoff, and the ``free peek"
OWNX	by abuse of notation, we will treat the bandit setting as a special case of the experts setting
MISC	the experts version of the lipschitz mab problem, called the  lipschitz experts problem , is defined in the obvious way: a problem instance is specified by a triple  symbol , where  symbol  is a metric space and  symbol  is a borel probability measure on the set  symbol  of payoff functions on  symbol  (with the borel  symbol -algebra induced by the product topology on  symbol ) such that the expected payoff function  symbol  is a lipschitz function on  symbol
OWNX	we show that the lipschitz experts problem exhibits a dichotomy similar to the one in theorem~
OWNX	we formulate the upper bound for the double feedback, and the lower bound for the full feedback, thus avoiding the issue of what it means for an algorithm to receive feedback for infinitely many strategies
OWNX	theorems~ and~ assert a dichotomy between metric spaces on which the lipschitz mab/experts problem is very tractable, and those on which it is somewhat tractable
OWNX	let us consider the opposite end of the ``tractability spectrum" and ask for which metric spaces the problem becomes completely intractable
OWNX	moreover, our upper bound is for the bandit setting, whereas the lower bound is for full feedback
MISC	consider the \ffproblem
MISC	gupta et al ~ citation  observed that such bounds hold for every metric space  symbol  of finite covering dimension: namely, the lipschitz experts problem on  symbol  is  symbol -tractable (their algorithm is a version of the ``naive algorithm'' from~ citation ) therefore it is natural to ask whether there exist metric spaces for which the optimal regret in the lipschitz experts problem is  between   symbol  and  symbol
OWNX	we settle this question by proving a characterization with nearly matching upper and lower bounds in terms of a novel dimensionality notion tailored to the experts problem
MISC	the lower bound in theorem~ holds for a restricted version of \ffproblem\ in which a problem instance  symbol  satisfies a further property that each function  symbol  is itself a lipschitz function on  symbol
OWNX	we term this version the   (with full feedback)
OWNX	in fact, for this version we obtain a matching upper bound \omit{ %%%%%% to this end, we consider ``very high-dimensional" metric spaces such as exponentially branching edge-weighted trees and the space of all probability distributions on  symbol  under the earthmover distance
OWNX	we introduce a novel dimensionality notion which better captures the complexity of such spaces and characterizes the regret of the ``naive" experts algorithm from~ citation  (interestingly, the \ulproblem{} allows for a very non-trivial improvement in the analysis ) } %%%%%%  \omit{ %%%%%%% for any metric space  symbol , there exist an isometry-invariant parameters  symbol  and  symbol  such that the \ffproblem\ on  symbol  is  symbol -tractable for any  symbol , and not  symbol -tractable for any  symbol

OWNX	there, we identify a simple topological property ( well-orderability ) which entails the algorithmic result, and another topological property ( perfectness ) which entails the lower bound
OWNX	we provide a proof in appendix~ for the sake of making our exposition self-contained
OWNX	then the main dichotomy results follow from the lower bound in theorem~ \xhdr{accessing the metric space } we define a bandit algorithm as a (possibly randomized) borel measurable function that maps a history of past observations  symbol  to a strategy  symbol  to be played in the current period
OWNX	for our algorithmic results, we handle this issue as follows: the metric space is accessed via well-defined calls to a suitable  oracle
MISC	for instance, {ucb1}~ citation  admits an instance-specific guarantee  symbol , whereas the best-known instance-independent guarantee for this algorithm is only  symbol , where  symbol  is the number of arms
MISC	accordingly, a lower bound for the instance-independent version has to show that for any algorithm and a given time  symbol , there exists a problem instance whose regret is large at this time, whereas for the instance-specific version one needs a much more ambitious argument: for any algorithm there exists a problem instance whose regret is large  infinitely often
MISC	early work~ citation  has focused on bayesian formulations in which bayesian priors on payoffs are known, and goal is to maximize the payoff in expectation over these priors
MISC	in the more ``difficult"  restless bandits   citation  formulations, the state also changes when the arm is passive, according to another transition matrix
MISC	in the theoretical computer science literature, recent work in this vein includes~ citation
MISC	interestingly, these bayesian formulations have an offline flavor: given the mdp, one needs to efficiently compute a (nearly) optimal mapping from states to actions
MISC	instead, it makes a very pessimistic assumption that payoffs are chosen by an adversary that has access to the algorithm's code but not to its random seed
MISC	as in the stochastic mab problem, the goal is to minimize regret
MISC	for any fixed (finite) number of arms, the best possible regret in this setting is  symbol ~ citation
MISC	for infinite strategy sets, one often considers the  linear mab problem  in which strategies lie in a convex subset of  symbol , and in each round the payoffs form a linear function~ citation  \omit{, or more generally, a convex function~ citation }  it is an open question whether the ideas from the lipschitz mab problem extend to the above formulations
MISC	however, this view is not likely to be fruitful because in the lipschitz mab problem measuring a payoff of one arm is useless for estimating the payoffs of distant arms, whereas in prior work on the linear mab problem inferences about distant arms are crucial
OWNX	we present a joint proof for the two main results (theorems~ and~)
OWNX	a complementary  symbol -intractability result for infinite metric spaces (theorem~) is in section~
OWNX	the  symbol -tractability result via simpler oracle access (for metric spaces of finite cantor-bendixson rank) is in section~
OWNX	the boundary-of-tractability result  (theorems~) is in section~
OWNX	in appendix~ we reduce the problem to that on complete metric spaces
OWNX	all kl-divergence arguments (which underlie our lower bounds) are gathered in appendix~
OWNX	we provide a self-contained proof of the topological lemma  (lemma~) in appendix~
OWNX	we consider computation of permanent of a positive  symbol  non-negative matrix,
MISC	  symbol , or equivalently the problem
MISC	 complete bipartite graph  symbol
MISC	the problem is known to be of likely exponential complexity
MISC	 representation [chertkov, chernyak '06] in terms of an interior minimum of the
MISC	 bethe free energy functional over non-integer doubly stochastic matrix of marginal beliefs,  symbol ,
MISC	 also correspondent to a fixed point of the iterative message-passing algorithm of the belief propagation (bp) type
MISC	 where  symbol  is the bp expression for the permanent stated explicitly in terms of  symbol
OWNX	we give two derivations of the formula, a direct one based on the bethe free energy and
MISC	 an alternative one combining the ihara graph- symbol  function and the loop calculus approaches
OWNX	assuming that the matrix  symbol  of the belief propagation marginals is calculated, we provide two lower bounds and one upper-bound to estimate the multiplicative term
MISC	the problem of calculating the permanent of a non-negative matrix arises in many contexts in
MISC	  citation
MISC	however, the problem is  symbol -hard   citation ,  meaning that solving it
MISC	 in a time polynomial in the system size,  symbol , is unlikely
MISC	therefore, when size of the matrix is sufficiently large, one naturally looks for ways to approximate the
MISC	 permanent
MISC	a very significant breakthrough  was achieved with invention of a so-called
MISC	 fully-polynomial-randomized algorithmic schemes (fpras) for the permanent problem  citation :
MISC	 the permanent is approximated in a polynomial time, with
MISC	however, the complexity of this fpras is  symbol , making it impractical for the majority of realistic applications
OWNX	this motivates the task of finding a lighter deterministic or probabilistic algorithm capable of
MISC	the bp family of algorithms,
MISC	 originally introduced in the context of error-correction codes  citation  and artificial
MISC	 intelligence  citation , can generally be stated for any graphical model  citation
MISC	however, in the
MISC	 general loopy cases one would normally not expect bp to work well,  thus making the heuristic results of  citation  somehow surprising,
MISC	 even though not completely unexpected in view of existence of polynomially efficient algorithms for the ml version of the problem  citation ,
MISC	 also realized in  citation  via an iterative bp algorithm
MISC	this raises the questions of understanding the performance of bp: what
MISC	 it does well and what it misses
MISC	it also motivates the challenge of improving the bp
MISC	 heuristics
MISC	an approach potentially capable of handling the question and the challenge was recently suggested in the general framework of gm
MISC	the loop series/calculus (ls) of  citation  expresses
MISC	 the ratio between the partition function (pf) of a binary gm and its bp estimate in terms of a finite series, in which each term is associated with the so-called generalized loop (a subgraph with all vertices of degree larger than one) of the graph
MISC	each term in the series,  as well as the bp estimate of the partition function, is expressed in terms of a doubly stochastic matrix of marginal probabilities,  symbol , for matching pairs to contribute a perfect matching
MISC	this matrix  symbol  describes a minimum of the so-called bethe free energy,  and it can also be understood as a fixed point of an iterative bp algorithm
MISC	in other words,  the ls holds the key to understanding the gap between
OWNX	in section  and section ,
OWNX	 we will give a technical introduction to the variational bethe free energy (bfe) formulation of bp and a brief
OWNX	 overview of the ls approach for the permanent problem respectively {our results }
MISC	 that a non-integer bp solution is observed only at  symbol , where  symbol  is defined by
OWNX	 \eq() (ii) at  symbol , we derive an alternative representation for the ls in section
MISC	the entire ls is collapsed to a product of two terms:
MISC	 the first term is an easy-to-calculate function of  symbol , and the second term is the permanent of the matrix,  symbol  (the binary operator  symbol  denotes the element-wise multiplication of matrices )
OWNX	 this is our main result stated in theorem , and the majority of the consecutive statements of our paper follows from it
OWNX	we also present yet another, alternative, derivation of the theorem  using the multivariate ihara-bass formula for the graph zeta-function in subsection  (iii) section  presents two easy-to-calculate lower bounds for the ls
MISC	the lower bound stated in the corollary  is based on the gurvits-van der waerden theorem applied to  symbol
MISC	interestingly enough this lower bound is invariant with respect to the bp transformation,
MISC	 i e it is exactly equivalent to the lower bound derived via
MISC	 application of the van der waerden-gurvits theorem to the original permanent
MISC	another
MISC	 at sufficiently small temperatures,  while the former
OWNX	possible future extensions of the approach are discussed in section
OWNX	the proposed approach consists of two main elements: (1)  filtering , or assigning a belief or likelihood to each successive measurement based upon our ability to predict it from previous noisy observations, and (2)  hedging , or flagging potential anomalies by comparing the current belief against a time-varying and data-adaptive threshold
MISC	at the heart of the proposed approach lie exponential-family models which can be used in a wide variety of contexts and applications, and which yield methods that achieve sublinear per-round regret against both static and slowly varying product distributions with marginals drawn from the same exponential family
MISC	moreover, the regret against static distributions coincides with the minimax value of the corresponding online strongly convex game
OWNX	we also prove bounds on the number of mistakes made during the hedging step relative to the best offline choice of the threshold with access to all estimated beliefs and feedback signals
OWNX	we validate the theory on synthetic data drawn from a time-varying distribution over binary vectors of high dimensionality, as well as on the enron email dataset \\   {keywords:} anomaly detection, exponential families, filtering, individual sequences, label-efficient prediction, minimax regret, online convex programming, prediction with limited feedback, sequential probability assignment, universal prediction
MISC	this inference is encapsulated in a binary decision  symbol , which can be either  symbol  (non-anomalous or nominal behavior) or  symbol  (anomalous behavior)
OWNX	our inference engine should make good use of this feedback, whenever it is available, to improve its future performance
MISC	one reasonable way to do it is as follows
OWNX	having observed  symbol  (but not  symbol ), we can use this observation to assign ``beliefs" or ``likelihoods" to the clean state  symbol
MISC	let us denote this likelihood assignment as  symbol
OWNX	thus, we settle instead for an  estimate   symbol  of  symbol  based on  symbol  and compare this estimate against  symbol
MISC	%   <- trailing '%' for backward compatibility of
MISC	sty file the sample compression conjecture of littlestone \& warmuth has remained unsolved for over two decades
MISC	while maximum classes (concept classes meeting sauer's lemma with equality) can be compressed, the compression of general concept classes reduces to compressing maximal classes (classes that cannot be expanded without increasing vc-dimension)
MISC	simple arrangements of hyperplanes in hyperbolic space are shown to represent maximum classes, generalizing the corresponding euclidean result
OWNX	we show that  sweeping a generic hyperplane across such arrangements forms an unlabeled compression scheme of size vc dimension and corresponds to a special case of peeling the one-inclusion graph, resolving a recent conjecture of kuzmin \& warmuth
MISC	a bijection between finite maximum classes and certain arrangements of piecewise-linear (pl) hyperplanes in either a ball or euclidean space is established
OWNX	finally we show that  symbol -maximum  classes corresponding to pl hyperplane arrangements in  symbol  have cubical complexes homeomorphic to a  symbol -ball, or equivalently complexes that are manifolds with boundary
MISC	a main result is that pl arrangements can be swept by a moving hyperplane to unlabeled  symbol -compress  any  finite maximum class, forming a peeling scheme as conjectured by kuzmin \& warmuth
MISC	this extends the well known pachner moves for triangulations to cubical complexes
MISC	such classes are of particular interest as their special recursive structure underlies all general sample compression schemes known to-date~ citation
OWNX	it is this structure that admits many elegant geometric and algebraic topological representations upon which this paper focuses
MISC	citation  introduced the study of \term{sample compression schemes}, defined as a pair of mappings for given concept class  symbol : a \term{compression function} mapping a  symbol -labeled  symbol -sample to a subsequence of labeled examples and a \term{reconstruction} \term{function} mapping the subsequence to a concept consistent with the entire  symbol -sample
MISC	a compression scheme of bounded size---the maximum cardinality of the subsequence image---was shown to imply learnability
MISC	interest in the  conjecture has been motivated by its interpretation as the converse to the existence of compression bounds for pac learnable classes~ citation , the basis of practical machine learning methods on compression schemes~ citation , and the conjecture's connection to a deeper understanding of the combinatorial properties of concept classes~ citation
MISC	recently~ citation  achieved compression of maximum classes without the use of labels
MISC	they also conjectured that their elegant min-peeling algorithm constitutes such an unlabeled  symbol -compression scheme for  symbol -maximum classes
MISC	these are also topological spaces, with each cube equipped with a natural topology of open sets from its standard embedding into euclidean space
OWNX	we proved that  symbol -maximum classes correspond to \term{ symbol -contractible complexes}---topological spaces with an identity map homotopic to a constant map---extending the result that  symbol -maximum classes have trees for one-inclusion graphs
MISC	peeling can be viewed as a special form of contractibility for maximum classes
MISC	however, there are many  non-maximum contractible cubical complexes that cannot be peeled, which demonstrates that peelability reflects more detailed structure of maximum classes than given by contractibility alone
MISC	citation  predicted that  symbol -maximum classes corresponding to simple linear hyperplane arrangements could be unlabeled  symbol -compressed by sweeping a generic hyperplane across the arrangement, and that concepts are min-peeled as their corresponding cell is swept away
OWNX	we positively resolve the first part of the conjecture and show that sweeping such arrangements corresponds to a new form of \term{corner-peeling}, which we prove is distinct from min-peeling
MISC	while \term{min-peeling} removes minimum degree concepts from a one-inclusion graph, corner-peeling peels vertices that are contained in unique cubes of maximum dimension
OWNX	we explore simple hyperplane arrangements in hyperbolic geometry, which we show correspond to a set of maximum classes, properly containing those represented by simple linear euclidean arrangements
OWNX	we present constructions for illustrative but simpler classes, suggesting that there are many interesting infinite maximum classes admitting explicit compression schemes, and under appropriate conditions, sweeping infinite euclidean, hyperbolic or pl arrangements corresponds to compression by  corner-peeling
OWNX	next we prove that all maximum classes in  symbol  are represented as simple arrangements of piecewise-linear (pl) hyperplanes in the  symbol -ball
MISC	this extends previous work by~ citation  on viewing simple pl hyperplane arrangements as maximum classes
MISC	the close relationship between such arrangements and their hyperbolic versions suggests that they could be equivalent
MISC	this motivates the nomenclature of  symbol -contractible for the class of arrangements of pl hyperplanes
MISC	note then that these one-inclusion graphs admit a corner-peeling scheme of the same  size  symbol  as the largest dimension of a cube in  symbol
MISC	moreover if such a graph  symbol  admits a corner-peeling scheme, then it is a contractible cubical complex
MISC	this reasoning motivates the attempt to embed  symbol -maximal classes into  symbol -maximum classes~ citation
OWNX	we present non-embeddability results following from our earlier counter-examples to kuzmin \& warmuth's minimum  degree conjecture~ citation , and our new results on corner-peeling
OWNX	finally, we investigate algebraic topological properties of maximum classes
OWNX	we conclude with several open problems
MISC	% in conventional supervised pattern recognition tasks, model selection is typically accomplished by minimizing the classification error rate on a set of so-called development data, subject to ground-truth labeling by human experts or some other means
MISC	in the context of speech processing systems and other large-scale practical applications, however, such labeled development data are typically costly and difficult to obtain
MISC	results provide supporting evidence for the utility of this approach, and suggest that it may also find use in other applications of machine learning
MISC	within the speech engineering community,  acoustic  likelihoods have long played a prominent role both as a training criterion and an objective function to aid in system development
MISC	log-likelihood ratios have in turn featured ever more prominently in areas such as speech, speaker, and language recognition; for instance, it is now common practice that ``target'' model likelihoods are compared to those of a universal ``background'' model as part of many large-scale speech processing systems~ citation
OWNX	we analyze the convergence behaviour of a recently proposed algorithm for regularized estimation called dual augmented lagrangian (dal)
OWNX	we  experimentally confirm our analysis in  a large scale  symbol -regularized logistic regression problem and   extensively compare the efficiency of dal algorithm to previously  proposed algorithms on both synthetic and benchmark datasets
MISC	sparse estimation through convex regularization has become a common practice in many application areas including bioinformatics and natural language processing
MISC	although the problem is convex, there are three factors that challenge the straight-forward application of general tools for convex optimization~ citation  in  the context of machine learning
MISC	the first factor is the diversity of loss functions
MISC	arguably the squared loss is most commonly used in the field of signal/image reconstruction, in which many algorithms for sparse estimation have been developed~ citation
MISC	however the variety of loss functions is much wider in machine learning, to name a few, logistic loss and other log-linear loss functions
MISC	note that these functions are not necessarily strongly convex like the squared loss
OWNX	see table~ for a list of loss functions that we consider
MISC	for a regression problem, the design matrix is defined by stacking input vectors along rows
MISC	if the input vectors are numerical (e g , gene expression data), the design matrix is dense and has no structure
MISC	the third factor is the large number of unknown variables (or parameters) compared to observations
MISC	this is a situation regularized estimation methods are commonly applied
MISC	various methods have been proposed for efficient sparse estimation (see  citation , and the references therein)
MISC	in fact, if the optimization problem can be decomposed into smaller (e g , containing a single variable) problems, optimization is easy
MISC	recently  citation  showed that the so called iterative shrinkage/thresholding (ist) method (see  citation ) can be seen  as an iterative  separable approximation  process
MISC	the proximal minimization framework also allows us to rigorously study the convergence behaviour of dal
MISC	what differentiates dal approach of  citation  from those studied earlier is that the al algorithm is applied to the dual problem (see \secref{sec:dalreview}), which results in an inner minimization problem that can be solved efficiently exploiting the sparsity of intermediate solutions (see \secref{sec:dall1})
MISC	applying al formulation to the dual problem also plays an important role in the convergence analysis because some loss functions (e g , logistic loss) are not strongly convex in the primal; see \secref{sec:analysis}
MISC	see also  citation  for related discussions
OWNX	in \secref{sec:framework}, we  mathematically formulate the sparse estimation problem and we review dal algorithm
OWNX	we derive dal algorithm from the proximal  minimization framework in  \secref{sec:proximal_view}, and   discuss special instances of dal algorithm are discussed in \secref{sec:instances}
OWNX	in \secref{sec:analysis}, we theoretically analyze the convergence behaviour of dal algorithm
OWNX	we discuss previously proposed algorithms in \secref{sec:algorithms} and contrast them with dal
OWNX	in \secref{sec:results} we confirm our analysis in a simulated  symbol -regularized logistic regression problem
OWNX	moreover, we extensively compare recently proposed algorithms for  symbol -regularized logistic regression including dal in   synthetic and benchmark datasets under a variety of conditions
MISC	most of the proofs are given in the appendix
MISC	% explaining adaptive behavior is a central problem in artificial intelligence research
MISC	each distribution of the mixture constitutes a `possible world', but the agent does not know which of the possible worlds it is actually facing
MISC	the problem is to adapt the i/o stream in a way that is compatible with the true world
MISC	in the case of pure input streams, the bayesian mixture provides a well-known solution for this problem
MISC	this rule might allow for a novel approach to adaptive control based on a minimum kl-principle
MISC	the ability to adapt to unknown environments is often considered a hallmark of intelligence  citation
MISC	agent and environment can be conceptualized as two systems that exchange symbols in every time step  citation : the symbol issued by the agent is an action, whereas the symbol issued by the environment is an observation
MISC	thus, both agent and environment can be conceptualized as probability distributions over sequences of actions and observations (i/o streams)
MISC	if the environment is perfectly known then the i/o probability distribution of the agent can be tailored to suit this particular environment
MISC	however, if the environment is unknown, but known to belong to a set of possible environments, then the agent faces an adaptation problem
MISC	consider, for example, a robot that has been endowed with a set of behavioral primitives and now faces the problem of how to act while being ignorant as to which is the correct primitive
MISC	since we want to model both agent and environment as probability distributions over i/o sequences, a natural way to measure the degree of adaptation would be to measure the `distance' in probability space between the i/o distribution represented by the agent and the i/o distribution conditioned on the true environment
MISC	a suitable measure (in terms of its information-theoretic interpretation) is readily provided by the kl-divergence  citation
MISC	in the case of passive prediction, the adaptation problem has a well-known solution
MISC	the distribution that minimizes the kl-divergence is a bayesian mixture distribution over all possible environments  citation
MISC	machine learning has been applied to the affinity classifier to produce affinity graphs that are good in the sense of minimizing edge misclassification rates
MISC	however, this error measure is only indirectly related to the quality of segmentations produced by ultimately partitioning the affinity graph
MISC	the rand index measures segmentation performance by quantifying the classification of the connectivity of image pixel pairs after segmentation
MISC	supervised learning has emerged as a serious contender in the field of image segmentation, ever since the creation of training sets of images with {}``ground truth'' segmentations provided by humans, such as the berkeley segmentation dataset  citation
MISC	in the supervised learning method presented here, the segmentation algorithm consists of a parametrized  classifier  that predicts the weights of a nearest neighbor affinity graph over image pixels, followed by a graph  partitioner  that thresholds the affinity graph and finds its connected components
OWNX	we {}``soften'' the thresholding of the classifier output and adjust the parameters of the classifier by gradient learning based on the rand index
MISC	the minimax path and edge are standard concepts in graph theory, and maximin is the opposite-sign sibling of minimax
OWNX	hence our work can be viewed as a machine learning application of these graph theoretic concepts
MISC	malis focuses on improving classifier output at maximin edges, because classifying these edges incorrectly leads to genuine segmentation errors, the splitting or merging of segments
OWNX	to the best of our knowledge, malis is the first supervised learning method that is based on optimizing a genuine measure of segmentation performance
MISC	the idea of training a classifier to predict the weights of an affinity graph is not novel
MISC	affinity classifiers were previously trained to minimize the number of misclassified affinity edges  citation
MISC	this is not the same as optimizing segmentations produced by partitioning the affinity graph
MISC	there have been attempts to train affinity classifiers to produce good segmentations when partitioned by normalized cuts  citation
MISC	but these approaches do not optimize a genuine measure of segmentation performance such as the rand index
MISC	however, they only minimize an upper bound to a renormalized version of the rand index
MISC	in other related work, classifiers have been trained to optimize performance at detecting image pixels that belong to object boundaries  citation
OWNX	however, we combine our classifier with a graph partitioner to produce segmentations
OWNX	the classifier parameters are not trained to optimize performance at boundary detection, but to optimize performance at segmentation as measured by the rand index
MISC	there are also methods for supervised learning of image labeling using markov or conditional random fields  citation
MISC	but image labeling is more similar to multi-class pixel classification rather than image segmentation, as the latter task may require distinguishing between multiple objects in a single image that all have the same label
MISC	for instance, tu et al citation  separately train low-level discriminative modules based on a boosting classifier, and train high-level modules of their algorithm to model the joint distribution of the image and the labeling
MISC	these models have never been trained to minimize the rand index
MISC	a dictionary defines words in terms of other words
MISC	definitions can tell you the meanings of words you don't know, but only if you know the meanings of the defining words
MISC	how many words do you need to know (and which ones) in order to be able to learn all the rest from definitions
MISC	the gk words turned out to have psycholinguistic correlates: they were learned at an earlier age and more concrete than the rest of the dictionary
MISC	a category is a  kind  of thing (object, event, action, trait or state)
MISC	to categorize is to do the right thing (eat, fight, flee, mate, etc ) with the right kind of thing
MISC	all species can acquire categories through trial and error  sensorimotor induction
OWNX	the words in our dictionaries are almost all the names of categories, followed by their definitions
MISC	this is the ``symbol grounding problem"  citation  and presumably that other means of acquiring categories is sensorimotor induction
MISC	but how many words -- and which ones -- need to be grounded directly through sensorimotor induction in order to allow all the rest to be acquired through verbal definition
OWNX	we have been analyzing dictionaries in order to answer this question
MISC	the gk has some striking properties: the words in it are learned at a significantly younger age than the rest of the dictionary and are also more concrete  citation , but if the variance correlated with age is removed, the residual gk words are more abstract than the rest of the dictionary
OWNX	we hope to be able to compute mgss for our special cases, but meanwhile the gks of our dictionaries -- cambridge international dictionary of english (cide)  citation  and longman dictionary of contemporary english (ldoce)  citation  -- already turn out to have more differentiated internal substructure which we begin analyzing further in this article
OWNX	in particular two substructures play important roles: the gk itself and a strongly connected subset of the gk that we call the ``kernel core" (kc)
MISC	the gk words that are acquired earlier, and are more concrete than the rest of the dictionary, tend to be in the kc, whereas the gk words uncorrelated with age of acquisition tend to be in the outer layer surrounding the kc and are more abstract
MISC	these correlations between the kc and the rest of the gk, and between the gk and the rest of the dictionary as a whole, are binary (0/1), but one can make more graded comparisons by considering definitional chains of increasing lengths
AIMX	in this paper, we attempt to fill this gap in the literature by analyzing the behavior of  symbol -means on well-clustered data
OWNX	in particular, we study the case when each cluster is distributed as a different gaussian -- or, in other words, when the input comes from a mixture of gaussians
OWNX	we analyze three aspects of the  symbol -means algorithm under this assumption
OWNX	first, we show that when the input comes from a mixture of two spherical gaussians, a variant of the  symbol -means algorithm successfully isolates the subspace containing the means of the mixture components
OWNX	second, we show an exact expression for the convergence of our variant of the  symbol -means algorithm, when the input is a very large number of samples from a mixture of spherical gaussians
MISC	the sample requirement grows with increasing dimensionality of the data, and decreasing separation between the means of the gaussians
OWNX	to match our upper bound, we show an information-theoretic lower bound on any algorithm that learns mixtures of two spherical gaussians; our lower bound indicates that in the case when the overlap between the probability masses of the two distributions is small, the sample requirement of  symbol -means is  near-optimal
MISC	one of the most popular algorithms for clustering in euclidean space is the  symbol -means algorithm~ citation ; this is a simple, local-search algorithm that iteratively refines a partition of the input points until convergence
MISC	like many local-search algorithms,  symbol -means is notoriously difficult to analyze, and few theoretical guarantees are known about it
MISC	there has been three lines of work on the  symbol -means algorithm
MISC	a first line of questioning addresses the quality of the solution produced by  symbol -means, in comparison to the globally optimal solution
MISC	a second line of work~ citation  examines the number of iterations required by  symbol -means to converge ~ citation  shows that there exists a set of  symbol  points on the plane, such that  symbol -means takes as many as  symbol  iterations to converge on these points
MISC	a smoothed analysis upper bound of  symbol  iterations has been established by~ citation , but this bound is still much higher than what is observed in practice, where the number of iterations are frequently sublinear in  symbol
MISC	moreover, the smoothed analysis bound applies to small perturbations of arbitrary inputs, and the question of whether one can get faster convergence on well-clustered inputs, is still unresolved
MISC	a third question, considered in the statistics literature, is the statistical efficiency of  symbol -means
MISC	are there other consistent procedures with a better sample requirement
MISC	such data is frequently modelled as a mixture of gaussians; a mixture is a collection of gaussians  symbol  and weights  symbol , such that  symbol
OWNX	to sample from the mixture, we first pick  symbol  with probability  symbol  and then draw a random sample from  symbol
MISC	clustering such data then reduces to the problem of  learning a mixture ; here, we are given only the ability to sample from a mixture, and our goal is to learn the parameters of each gaussian  symbol , as well as determine which gaussian each sample came from
OWNX	our results are as follows
OWNX	first, we show that when the input comes from a mixture of two spherical gaussians, a variant of the  symbol -means algorithm successfully isolates the subspace containing the means of the gaussians
OWNX	second, we show an exact expression for the convergence of a variant of the  symbol -means algorithm, when the input is a large number of samples from a mixture of two spherical gaussians
MISC	the sample requirement grows with increasing dimensionality of the data, and decreasing separation between the means of the distributions
OWNX	to match our upper bound, we show an information-theoretic lower bound on any algorithm that learns mixtures of two spherical gaussians; our lower bound indicates that in the case when the overlap between the probability masses of the two distributions is small, the sample requirement of  symbol -means is  near-optimal
OWNX	we show that this angle decreases with iterations of our variant of  symbol -means, and we can characterize convergence rates and sample requirements, by characterizing the rate of decrease of the potential
MISC	one of the most popular algorithms for clustering in euclidean space is the  symbol -means algorithm citation
MISC	symbol -means is an iterative algorithm, which begins with an initial partition of the input points, and successively refines the partition until convergence
MISC	a mixture model  symbol  is a collection of distributions  symbol  and weights  symbol , such that  symbol
MISC	a sample from a mixture  symbol  is obtained by selecting  symbol  with probability  symbol , and then selecting a random sample from  symbol
MISC	given only the ability to sample from a mixture, the problem of learning a mixture is that of (a) determining the parameters of the distributions comprising the mixture and (b) classifying the samples, according to source distribution
MISC	most previous work on  the analysis of  symbol -means~ citation  studies the problem in a statistical setting, and shows  consistency guarantees, when the number of samples tend to infinity
MISC	the  symbol -means algorithm is also closely related to the widely-used em algorithm~ citation  for learning mixture models -- essentially, the main difference between  symbol -means and em being that em allows a sample to fractionally belong to multiple clusters and  symbol -means does not
MISC	most previous work on analyzing em view it as an optimization procedure over the likelihood surface, and study its convergence properties by analyzing the likelihood surface around the optimum~ citation
OWNX	moreover, we quantify the number of samples required by  symbol -means to work correctly \medskip{ our results } more specifically, our results are as follows
OWNX	we perform a probabilistic analysis of a variant of  symbol -means; our variant is essentially a symmetrized version of  symbol -means, and it reduces to  symbol -means when we have a very large number of samples from a mixture of two identical spherical gaussians with equal weights
OWNX	in the  symbol -means algorithm, the separator between the two clusters is always a hyperplane, and we use the angle  symbol   between the normal to this hyperplane and the mean of a mixture component  in round  symbol , as a measure of the potential in each round
OWNX	note that  when  symbol , we have arrived at the correct solution
OWNX	first, in section~, we consider the case when we have at our disposal a very large number of samples from a mixture of  symbol  and  symbol  with mixing weights  symbol  respectively
OWNX	we show an exact relationship between  symbol  and  symbol , for any value of  symbol ,  symbol ,  symbol  and  symbol
OWNX	using this relationship, we can approximate the rate of convergence of  symbol -means, for different values of the separation, as well as different initialization procedures
OWNX	next, in section~, we characterize the sample requirement for our variant of  symbol -means to succeed, when the input is a mixture of two spherical gaussians
OWNX	for the case of two identical spherical gaussians with equal mixing weight, our results imply that when the separation  symbol , and when  symbol  samples are used in each round, the  symbol -means algorithm makes progress at roughly the same rate as in section~
MISC	this agrees with the  symbol  sample complexity lower bound~ citation  for learning a mixture of gaussians on the line, as well as with experimental results of~ citation
OWNX	when  symbol , our variant of  symbol -means makes progress in each round, when the number of samples is at least  symbol
OWNX	then, in section~, we provide an information-theoretic lower bound on the sample requirement of any algorithm for learning a mixture of two spherical gaussians with standard deviation  symbol  and equal weight
MISC	this indicates that  symbol -means has near-optimal sample requirement when  symbol
MISC	in statistics literature, the  symbol -means algorithm has been shown to be consistent~ citation  ~ citation  shows that minimizing the  symbol -means objective function (namely, the sum of the squares of the distances between each point and the center it is assigned to), is consistent, given sufficiently many samples
MISC	none of these two works quantify either the convergence rate or the exact sample requirement of  symbol -means
MISC	there has been two lines of previous work on theoretical analysis of the em algorithm~ citation , which is closely related to  symbol -means
MISC	first, ~ citation  views learning mixtures as an optimization problem, and em as an optimization procedure over the likelihood surface
MISC	an optimization procedure on a parameter  symbol  is said to have first-order convergence, if,   symbol  where  symbol  is the estimate of  symbol  at time step  symbol  using  symbol  samples,  symbol  is the maximum likelihood estimator for  symbol  using  symbol  samples, and  symbol  is some fixed constant between  symbol  and  symbol
MISC	for their analysis to work,  they require the mixture components to be separated such that two samples from the same gaussian are a little closer in space than two samples from different gaussians
MISC	additionally,~ citation  show a spectral algorithm which learns a mixture of  symbol  binary product distributions, when the distributions have small overlap in probability mass, and the sample size is at least  symbol
MISC	citation  shows that at least  symbol  samples are required to learn a mixture of two gaussians in one dimension
OWNX	we note that although our lower bound of  symbol  for  symbol  seems to contradict the upper bound of~ citation , this is not actually the case
OWNX	our lower bound characterizes the number of samples required to find a vector at an angle  symbol  with the vector joining the means
OWNX	however, in order to classify a constant fraction of the points correctly, we only need to find a vector at an angle  symbol  with the vector joining the means
MISC	in addition to theoretical analysis, there has been very interesting experimental work due to~ citation , which studies the sample requirement for em on a mixture of  symbol  spherical gaussians
MISC	they conjecture that the problem of learning mixtures has three phases, depending on the number of samples : with less than about  symbol  samples, learning mixtures is information-theoretically hard; with more than about  symbol  samples, it is computationally easy, and in between, computationally hard, but easy in an information-theoretic sense
MISC	finally, there has been a line of work which provides algorithms (different from em or  symbol -means) that are guaranteed to learn mixtures of gaussians under certain separation conditions -- see, for example,~ citation
OWNX	for mixtures of two gaussians, our result is comparable to the best results for spherical gaussians~ citation  in terms of separation requirement, and we have a smaller sample requirement
OWNX	% after building a classifier with modern tools of machine learning we typically have a black box at hand that is able to predict well for unseen data
MISC	thus, we get an answer to the question  what  is the most likely label of a given unseen data point
MISC	however, most methods will provide no answer  why  the model predicted the particular label for a single instance and what features were most influential for that particular instance
MISC	machine learning research has created methods that are practically useful and that can classify unseen data after being trained on a limited training set of labeled examples
MISC	nevertheless, most of the algorithms do not  explain  their decision
OWNX	however in practical data analysis it is essential to obtain an instance based explanation, i e we would like to gain an understanding what input features made the nonlinear machine give its answer for each individual data point
MISC	typically, explanations are provided jointly for all instances of the training set, for example feature selection methods  (including automatic relevance determination) find out which inputs are salient for a good generalization  citation
MISC	in the neural network literature also solely an ensemble view was taken in algorithms like input pruning  citation
MISC	the only classification which does provide individual explanations are decision trees  citation
MISC	the local explanation yields the features being relevant for the prediction at the very points of interest in the data space and is able to spot local peculiarities which are neglected in the global view eg due to cancellation effects
MISC	some methods output a prediction without a direct probability interpretation
OWNX	for these we propose in section  a way to estimate local explanations
OWNX	in section  we will apply our methodology to learn distinguishing properties of iris flowers by estimating explanation vectors for a k-nn classifier applied to the classic iris data set
OWNX	section  will discuss how our approach applied to a svm classifier allows us to explain how digits "two" are distinguished from digit "8" in the usps data set
MISC	models capable of explaining predictions can help in the process of choosing promising modifications
OWNX	our automatically generated explanations match with chemical domain knowledge about toxifying functional groups of the compounds in question
MISC	many enterprises employ a chief information security officer~(ciso) to manage the enterprise's information security risks
MISC	typically, an enterprise has many more security vulnerabilities than it can realistically repair
MISC	instead of declaring the enterprise ``insecure'' until every last vulnerability is plugged, cisos typically perform a cost-benefit analysis to identify which risks to address, but what constitutes an effective ciso strategy
MISC	the conventional wisdom~ citation  is that cisos ought to adopt a ``forward-looking'' proactive approach to mitigating security risk by examining the enterprise for vulnerabilities that might be exploited in the future
MISC	advocates of proactive security often equate reactive security with myopic bug-chasing and consider it ineffective
OWNX	we establish sufficient conditions for when reacting  strategically  to attacks is as effective in discouraging attackers
OWNX	we study the efficacy of reactive strategies in an economic model of the ciso's security cost-benefit trade-offs
OWNX	unlike previously proposed economic models of security (see section~), we do not assume the attacker acts according to a fixed probability distribution
OWNX	instead, we consider a game-theoretic model with a strategic attacker who responds to the defender's strategy
OWNX	as is standard in the security literature, we make worst-case assumptions about the attacker
MISC	for example, we grant the attacker complete knowledge of the defender's strategy and do not require the attacker to act rationally
MISC	however, we do assume that the defender can observe the attacker's past actions, for example via an intrusion detection system or user metrics~ citation
OWNX	in our model, we find that two properties are sufficient for a reactive strategy to perform as well as the best proactive strategies
MISC	first, no single attack is catastrophic, meaning the defender can survive a number of attacks
MISC	this is consistent with situations where intrusions (that, say, steal credit card numbers) are regrettable but not business-ending
MISC	second, the defender's budget is \term{liquid}, meaning the defender can re-allocate resources without penalty
MISC	for example, a ciso can reassign members of the security team from managing firewall rules to improving database access controls at relatively low switching costs
OWNX	by making this assumption, we choose not to study the tactical patch-by-patch interaction of the attacker and defender
OWNX	instead, we model enterprise security at a more abstract level appropriate for the ciso
MISC	for example, the ciso might allocate a portion of his or her budget to engage a consultancy, such as whitehat or isec partners, to find and fix cross-site scripting in a particular web application or to require that employees use securid tokens during authentication
OWNX	we make the technical assumption that attacker costs are linearly dependent on defense investments locally
MISC	this assumption does not reflect patch-by-patch interaction, which would be better represented by a step function (with the step placed at the cost to deploy the patch)
OWNX	instead, this assumption reflects the ciso's higher-level viewpoint where the staircase of summed step functions fades into a slope
OWNX	by studying this metric, we focus on defenders who seek to ``cut off the attacker's oxygen,'' that is to reduce the attacker's incentives for attacking the enterprise
OWNX	instead, we compare the payoff the attacker receives from his or her nefarious deeds with the cost of performing said deeds
OWNX	we imagine that sufficiently disincentivized attackers will seek alternatives, such as attacking a different organization or starting a legitimate business
OWNX	in our main result, we show sufficient conditions for a learning-based reactive strategy to be competitive with the best fixed proactive defense in the sense that the competitive ratio between the reactive roa and the proactive roa is at most  symbol , for all  symbol , provided the game lasts sufficiently many rounds (at least  symbol )
OWNX	to prove our theorems, we draw on techniques from the online learning literature
OWNX	although our main results are in a graph-based model with a single attacker, our results generalize to a model based on horn clauses with multiple attackers
OWNX	our results are also robust to switching from roa to attacker profit and to allowing the proactive defender to revise the defense allocation a fixed number of times
MISC	such a strategic reactive strategy is both easier to implement than a proactive strategy---because it does not presume that the defender knows the attacker's intent and capabilities---and is less wasteful than a proactive strategy because the defender does not expend budget on attacks that do not actually occur
OWNX	based on our results, we encourage cisos to  question the assumption that proactive risk management is inherently superior to reactive risk management \paragraph{organization } section~ formalizes our model
OWNX	section~ shows that perimeter defense and defense-in-depth arise naturally in our model
OWNX	section~ presents our main results bounding the competitive ratio of reactive versus proactive defense strategies
OWNX	section~ outlines scenarios in which reactive security out-performs proactive security

OWNX	section~ concludes }
MISC	% the problem is sequence prediction in the following setting
OWNX	a sequence  symbol  of discrete-valued observations is generated  according to some unknown probabilistic law (measure)  symbol
MISC	the measure   symbol  belongs to an arbitrary but known class  symbol   of stochastic process measures
MISC	in general this goal is impossible to achieve if  nothing is known about the measure  symbol  generating the sequence
MISC	in other words, one cannot have a predictor whose error goes to zero for any measure  symbol
MISC	the  questions addressed in this work are a part of the following general problem: given an arbitrary set   symbol  of measures, how can we find  a predictor that performs well when the data is generated by any   symbol , and whether it is possible to find such a predictor at all
MISC	clearly, this condition is very strong
MISC	an example,  important from the applications point of view,  of a class  symbol  of measures   for which  predictors are known,  is the class of all stationary measures
MISC	the general question, however, is very far from being answered
OWNX	the contribution of this work to solving this question is, first, in that we  provide a specific form in which to look for a predictor
MISC	more precisely, we show that if a predictor that predicts every  symbol  exists,  then such a predictor  can also be obtained as a weighted sum of  countably many elements of  symbol
MISC	this result can also be viewed as a justification of the bayesian approach to sequence prediction: if there exists  a predictor which predicts well every measure in the class, then there exists a bayesian predictor (with a rather simple prior) that has this property too
OWNX	in this respect it is important to note that the result obtained about such a  bayesian predictor is pointwise (holds for every  symbol  in  symbol ), and stretches far beyond the set its prior is concentrated on
OWNX	next, we derive some characterizations of families  symbol  for which a  predictor exist
OWNX	we first analyze what is furnished by the notion of separability, when a suitable topology can be found: we find that  it is a sufficient but not always a necessary condition
OWNX	we then derive some sufficient conditions for the existence of a predictor which are based on local (truncated to the first  symbol  observation) behaviour of measures in the class  symbol
OWNX	necessary conditions cannot be obtained in this way (as we demonstrate), but  sufficient conditions, along with rates  of convergence and construction of predictors, can be found
MISC	the {motivation} for studying predictors for arbitrary classes  symbol  of processes is two-fold
MISC	indeed, in order to be able to find optimal behaviour in an unknown environment, an intelligent agent must be able, at the very least, to predict how the environment is going to behave (or, to be more precise, how relevant  parts of the environment are going to behave)
MISC	since the response of the environment may in general depend on the actions of the agent, this response is necessarily non-stationary for explorative agents
MISC	therefore, one cannot readily use prediction methods developed for stationary  environments, but rather has to find predictors for the classes of processes that can appear as a possible response of the environment
MISC	apart from this, the problem of prediction itself has numerous applications in such diverse fields as data compression, market analysis,  bioinformatics, and many others
MISC	it seems clear that prediction methods constructed for one application cannot be expected to be optimal when applied to another
MISC	therefore, an important question is how to develop specific prediction algorithms for each of the domains {prior work}
MISC	as it was mentioned,  if the class  symbol  of measures is countable (that is, if  symbol  can be represented as  symbol ), then  there exists a predictor which performs well for any  symbol
MISC	such a predictor can be obtained as a  bayesian mixture   symbol , where  symbol  are summable positive real weights, and it has very strong predictive properties; in particular,   symbol  predicts every  symbol  in total variation distance, as follows from the result of   citation
MISC	in the context of sequence prediction the measure  symbol   was first studied  by   citation
MISC	since then, the idea of taking a convex combination of a finite or countable class of measures (or predictors) to obtain a predictor permeates most of the research on sequential prediction (see, for example,  citation ) and  more general learning problems~ citation
MISC	in practice it is clear that, on the one hand, countable models are not sufficient, since already the class  symbol  of bernoulli  iid 
MISC	processes, where  symbol  is the probability of 0, is not countable
MISC	on the other hand, prediction in total variation can be too strong to require; predicting probabilities of the next observation may be sufficient, maybe even not  on every step but in the cesaro sense
MISC	a key observation here is that a predictor  symbol  may be a good predictor not only when the data is generated by one of the processes  symbol ,  symbol , but when it comes from a much larger class
MISC	let us consider this point in more detail
MISC	the laplace predictor  symbol } predicts any bernoulli  iid  ~process: although convergence in total variation distance of conditional probabilities does not hold, predicted probabilities of the next outcome converge to the correct ones
MISC	as was found by  citation , the combination  symbol  is a good predictor not only for the set  symbol  of all finite-memory processes, but also for any measure  symbol  coming from a much larger class: that of all stationary measures on  symbol
MISC	the laplace predictor itself can be obtained as a bayes mixture over all bernoulli  iid 
MISC	measures with uniform  prior on the parameter  symbol  (the probability of 0)
MISC	however, as was observed in  citation  (and as is easy to see), the same (asymptotic) predictive properties are possessed by  a bayes mixture with a countably supported prior which is dense in   symbol  (e g taking  symbol  where  symbol  ranges over all bernoulli  iid 
MISC	measures with rational probability of 0)
MISC	for a given  symbol , the set of  symbol -order markov processes is parametrized by finitely many  symbol -valued parameters
MISC	taking a dense  subset of the values of these parameters, and a mixture of the corresponding measures, results in a predictor for the class of  symbol -order markov processes
MISC	thus, for the mentioned classes of processes, a predictor can be obtained as a bayes mixture of  countably many measures in the class
MISC	an additional reason why this kind  of analysis is interesting is because of the difficulties arising in trying to construct  bayesian predictors for classes of processes that can not be easily parametrized
MISC	indeed, a natural way to obtain  a predictor for a class  symbol  of stochastic processes is to take a bayesian mixture of the class
MISC	to do this, one needs to define the structure of a probability space on  symbol
MISC	if the class  symbol  is well parametrized, as is the case with the set of all bernoulli  iid 
MISC	process, then one can  integrate with respect to the parametrization
MISC	in general, when the problem lacks a natural parametrization, although one can define the structure of the probability  space on the set of (all) stochastic process measures in many different ways, the results one can obtain will then be with probability 1 with respect to the prior distribution (see, for example,  citation )
MISC	results with prior probability 1  can be hard to interpret if one is not sure that the structure  of the probability space defined on the set  symbol  is indeed a natural one for the problem at hand (whereas if one does have a natural parametrization, then usually results for every value of the parameter can be obtained, as in the case with bernoulli  iid 
MISC	processes mentioned above)
MISC	the results of the present work show that when a predictor exists it can indeed be given as  a bayesian  predictor, which predicts  every (and not almost every) measure in the class, while its support is only a countable set
MISC	a related question is formulated as a question about two individual measures, rather than about a class of measures and a predictor
MISC	in  citation  it was shown that  if one measure is absolutely continuous with respect to another, than  the latter predicts the former (the conditional probabilities converge in a very strong sense)
MISC	this holds if the prediction quality is measured by either total variation distance, or expected average kl divergence:  one measure of performance that is very strong, the other rather weak
MISC	the proof techniques developed  have a potential to be used in solving other questions concerning sequence prediction, in particular, the general question of how to find a predictor for an arbitrary class  symbol  of measures
OWNX	we then  exhibit some sufficient conditions on the class  symbol , under which a predictor for all measures in  symbol  exists
MISC	the conditions presented are of  two types: conditions on asymptotic behaviour of measures in  symbol , and on their local (restricted to first  symbol  observations) behaviour
OWNX	we show that in the case of total variation separability is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a predictor, whereas in the case of expected average kl divergence it is sufficient but is not necessary
MISC	the conditions of the second kind concern the ``capacity'' of the sets  symbol ,  symbol , where  symbol  is the measure  symbol  restricted to the first  symbol  observations
MISC	intuitively, if  symbol  is small (in some sense), then prediction is possible
OWNX	we measure the capacity of  symbol  in two ways
MISC	the first way is  to find the maximum probability given to each sequence  symbol  by some measure in the class, and then take a sum over  symbol
MISC	on the other hand, exponentially growing  symbol  are not sufficient for prediction
MISC	a more refined way to measure the capacity of  symbol  is using a concept of channel capacity from information  theory, which was developed for a closely related problem of finding optimal  codes for a class of sources
OWNX	we extend corresponding results from information theory to show that sublinear growth of channel capacity  is sufficient for the existence of a predictor, in the sense of expected average divergence
OWNX	section~  introduces the notation and definitions
OWNX	finally, section~ provides outlook and discussion
OWNX	as running examples that illustrate the results of each section  we use countable classes of measures, the family of all bernoulli  iid 
MISC	an approach to the classification problem of machine learning, based on building local classification rules, is developed
OWNX	the local rules are considered as projections of the global classification rules to the event we want to classify
MISC	the algorithm is practical; it was tested on a number of data sets from uci repository, and a comparison with the other predicting techniques is presented
MISC	extraction of structural information from raw data is a problem which is of great interest for both fundamental and applied studies
MISC	the goal is to predict a class of a particular event
MISC	this problem was approached from a number of  different disciplines, including statistical data analysis  citation , machine learning  citation , fuzzy logic  citation , operations research  citation  and data mining  citation
MISC	the result of learning can be represented  in a number of different forms
MISC	it should be stressed that some other forms  (such as decision trees, fuzzy models and many others) are equivalent to a set of rules
MISC	a set of rules (or any other form to which  it is equivalent) is often a preferred form of knowledge representation because it allows for  a simple answer to the question, ``what was learned
MISC	'' this specific set of rules was learned from the data
OWNX	the lazy instance--based techniques, such as developed in  citation , return a result tailored to the specific event  we want to classify
MISC	with such techniques  the events similar to the given one are usually found first, then a prediction based on found instances is made
MISC	an interesting attempt to combine model based and lazy instance based learning  was presented in  citation
MISC	while such an approach gives a simple rule as an answer  (which is often much easier to understand than a complex rules set) and often works faster for classification of a single event, it--as every greedy algorithm--is not guaranteed to find  the best rule, because the algorithm may not reach the global maximum of the quality criterion and a sub--optimal rule may be returned
MISC	in the work  citation  an approach based on the brute force of rule--space scanning was developed
MISC	in contrast with greedy type algorithms,   massive search algorithms are guaranteed to find the best rule(s)
OWNX	in our early work  citation   we presented an approach which combined the  massive model--based rule search approach  with lazy instance--based learning
MISC	one may think about these rules as  a projection of a global classification rules set to the given instance of the event
MISC	a number of significant improvements have been made since that early version
MISC	an original conflicting rules resolution strategy  which was especially built to work with automatically  generated rules
MISC	to create a practical algorithm, the three aspects --- logical, statistical and computational complexity need to be addressed
OWNX	in section  we discuss  the statistical quality criterion which can be used  for evaluation of rule quality and specify the  criteria which we use in this work
OWNX	at the end of section  a sketch of the algorithm is presented
OWNX	in section  we discuss the selection  of attributes for analysis; it should be  stressed that some attributes as they are built in  section  are not independent, and this fact is known in advance
OWNX	in section  we discuss  computational complexity issues; an approach which includes information about dependence of the attributes into the  algorithm is proposed
OWNX	in section  we discuss error estimation
OWNX	in section  we present the data analysis results  and compare our results with the results of c4 5r8  citation
OWNX	in section  a discussion is presented
MISC	competitive on-line prediction (also known as universal prediction of individual sequences) is a strand of learning theory avoiding making any stochastic assumptions about the way the observations are generated
AIMX	this paper discusses strengths and limitations of the direct approach to competitive on-line prediction via metric entropy, including comparisons to other approaches
MISC	a typical result of competitive on-line prediction says that, for a given benchmark class of prediction strategies, there is a prediction strategy that performs almost as well as the best prediction strategies in the benchmark class
MISC	typically, this method does not give optimal results, but its results are often not much worse than those given by specialized methods, especially for benchmark classes that are not too massive
OWNX	we start, in \s, by stating a simple asymptotic result about the existence of a universal prediction strategy for the class of continuous prediction rules
OWNX	this is the topic of the following section, \s, where we establish general results about performance guarantees based on metric entropy
OWNX	for example, in the simplest case where the benchmark class  symbol  is a compact set, the performance guarantees become weaker as the metric entropy of  symbol  becomes larger
MISC	the classes of type iv, considered in \s, have metric entropy that grows even faster
OWNX	in we ask the question of how prediction strategies competitive against various benchmark classes compare to each other
OWNX	the previous section, \s, prepares the ground for this \iffullin standard methods are used to deduce implications of the results of preceding sections for statistical learning theory \blueendthe concluding section, \s, lists several directions of further research
MISC	i hope it will be useful as a survey
OWNX	we propose and analyze a new vantage point for the learning of mixtures of gaussians: namely, the pac-style model of learning probability distributions introduced by kearns~et~al ~ citation
MISC	here the task is to construct a hypothesis mixture of gaussians that is statistically indistinguishable from the actual mixture generating the data; specifically, the kl~divergence should be at most  symbol
OWNX	in this scenario, we give a  symbol  time algorithm that learns the class of mixtures of any constant number of axis-aligned gaussians in  symbol
OWNX	our algorithm makes  no  assumptions about the separation between the means of the gaussians, nor does it have any dependence on the minimum mixing weight
MISC	this is in contrast to learning results known in the ``clustering'' model, where such assumptions are unavoidable
MISC	in~ citation  kearns et al \ introduced an elegant and natural model of learning unknown probability distributions
MISC	the learning algorithm should run in time  symbol
MISC	several notable results, both positive and negative, have been obtained for learning in the kearns et al \ framework of~ citation , see, eg ,  citation
MISC	here we briefly survey some of the positive results that have been obtained for learning various types of  mixture distributions  (recall that given distributions  symbol  and mixing weights  symbol  that sum to 1, a draw from the corresponding mixture distribution is obtained by first selecting  symbol  with probability  symbol  and then making a draw from  symbol ) kearns et al \ gave an efficient algorithm for learning certain mixtures of  hamming balls ; these are product distributions over  symbol  in which each coordinate mean is either  symbol  or  symbol  for some  symbol  fixed over all mixture components
MISC	subsequently freund and mansour~ citation  and independently cryan et al ~ citation  gave efficient algorithms for learning a mixture of two arbitrary product distributions over  symbol
MISC	recently, feldman et al ~ citation  gave a  symbol -time algorithm that learns a mixture of any  symbol  many arbitrary product distributions over the discrete domain  symbol  for any  symbol
OWNX	we introduce a simple framework for learning aggressive maneuvers in flight control of uavs
MISC	having inspired from biological environment, dynamic movement primitives are analyzed and extended using nonlinear contraction theory
MISC	accordingly, primitives of an observed movement are stably combined and concatenated
OWNX	we demonstrate our results experimentally on the quanser helicopter, in which we first imitate aggressive maneuvers  and then use them as primitives to achieve new maneuvers that can fly over an obstacle
MISC	the role of uavs (unmanned aerial vehicles) has gained significant importance in the last decades
MISC	they have many advantages (agility, low surface area, ability to work in constrained or dangerous places) over their conventional precedents
MISC	in addition, current uavs are more biologically-inspired in terms of shape and performance because of the improvements in electronics and propulsion
MISC	this  is mostly related with the weakness of current control algorithms against high-dimensional and   nonlinear environments
MISC	in this sense, generating aggressive maneuvers is interesting and hard to accomplish
MISC	in experiments, obstacle avoidance dmp of a human-piloted flight data is segmented into parts and combined at different initial points to achieve maneuvers against different obstacles on different locations
OWNX	background of our work is briefly detailed below
MISC	the cross-entropy method (ce) developed by r
OWNX	the method approximates the probability of the rare event by means of a family of probabilistic models
MISC	the method has been extended to optimization, by considering an optimal event as a rare event
MISC	ce works rather good when dealing with deterministic function optimization
MISC	now, it appears that two conditions are needed for a good convergence of the method
MISC	indirectly, it appears also that the function to be optimized should be deterministic
MISC	it will be shown on simple examples that the ce could fail when relaxing these hypotheses
MISC	the cross-entropy method has been developed by r
MISC	rubinstein for the simulation of rare events citation
MISC	the algorithm iteratively builds a near-optimal importance sampling of the rare event, based on a family of parameterized sampling laws
MISC	first, the proof has been made in a deterministic context
OWNX	secondly, the closure of the simulation law family should contain the dirac on the optimum (or laws with support on the optimums) \\[5pt] the first condition cannot be fulfilled properly, in case of stochastic problem
MISC	but there are some cases, where it is not possible to handle all the solutions precisely by the law family
MISC	indeed, the solutions may not be countable practically; this is typically the case for some dynamic problems (for example, the strategy tree against a deterministic computer chess player)
MISC	nevertheless, smoother selection criteria seem to be a possible answer to these difficulties
MISC	is this approximation the best possible within the law family
OWNX	our answer to this question is not absolutely negative
MISC	but it appears that some extensions of the ce, quite usually implemented, will fail on this question
OWNX	in the case of stochastic optimization, tests are done on simple random examples in order to compare the convergence of various ce methods with the global optimum \\[5pt] next section introduces shortly the principle of the ce method
OWNX	section~ will consider the case, where the optimal solution is not caught properly by the sampling family
MISC	a counterexample is proposed and studied
OWNX	in section~, stochastic problems are considered
MISC	different evolutions of the cross-entropy are then compared to the basical method, by generating several random examples
OWNX	section~ concludes
MISC	much recent work in bioinformatics has focused on the inference of various types of biological networks, representing gene regulation, metabolic processes, protein-protein interactions, etc
MISC	a common setting involves inferring network edges in a supervised fashion from a set of high-confidence edges, possibly characterized by multiple, heterogeneous data sets (protein sequence, gene expression, etc )
OWNX	we propose a supervised approach for the direct case by translating it into a distance metric learning problem
OWNX	a relaxation of the resulting convex optimization problem leads to the support vector machine (svm) algorithm with a particular kernel for pairs, which we call the  metric learning pairwise kernel
OWNX	we demonstrate, using several real biological networks, that this direct approach often improves upon the state-of-the-art svm for indirect inference with the tensor product pairwise kernel
MISC	increasingly, molecular and systems biology is concerned with describing various types of subcellular networks
OWNX	these include protein-protein interaction networks, metabolic networks, gene regulatory and signaling pathways, and genetic interaction networks
MISC	while some of these networks can be partly deciphered by high-throughput experimental methods, fully constructing any such network requires lengthy biochemical validation
MISC	edges in a network can be inferred from relevant data in at least two complementary ways
MISC	for concreteness, consider a network of protein-protein interactions derived from some noisy, high-throughput technology
OWNX	our confidence in the correctness of a particular edge  symbol --- symbol  in this network increases if we observe, for example, that the two proteins  symbol  and  symbol  localize to the same cellular compartment or share similar evolutionary patterns  citation
MISC	generally, in this type of  direct inference , two genes or proteins are predicted to interact if they bear some direct similarity  to each other  in the available data
MISC	in the example above, our confidence in  symbol --- symbol  increases if we find some other, high-confidence edge  symbol --- symbol  such that the pair  symbol  resembles  symbol  in some meaningful fashion
MISC	note that in this model, the two connected proteins  symbol  and  symbol  might not be similar to one another
MISC	for example, if the goal is to detect edges in a regulatory network by using time series expression data, one would expect the time series of the regulated protein to be delayed in time compared to that of the regulatory protein
MISC	indirect inference amounts to a straightforward application of the machine learning paradigm to the problem of edge inference: each edge is an example, and the task is to learn by example to discriminate between ``true'' and ``false'' edges
MISC	not surprisingly, therefore, several machine learning algorithms have been applied to predict network edges from properties of protein pairs
MISC	for example, in the context of machine learning with support vector machines (svm) and kernel methods, ben-hur and noble  citation  describe how to map an embedding of individual proteins onto an embedding of pairs of proteins
MISC	the mapping defines two pairs of proteins as similar to each other when each protein in a pair is similar to one corresponding protein in the other pair
MISC	in practice, the mapping is defined by deriving a kernel function on pairs of proteins from a kernel function  symbol  on individual proteins, obtained by a tensorization of the initial feature space
MISC	two exceptions are the works of yamanishi  et al citation  and vert  et al citation , who derive supervised machine learning algorithms to optimize the measure of similarity that underlies the direct approach by learning from examples of interacting and non-interacting pairs
MISC	yamanishi  et al employ kernel canonical correlation analysis to embed the proteins into a feature space where distances are expected to correlate with the presence or absence of interactions between protein pairs
MISC	second, the methods of  citation  and  citation  are applicable only when the known part of the network used for training is defined by a subset of proteins in the network
MISC	this setting is unrealistic
OWNX	in practice, our training data will generally consist of known positive and negative edges distributed throughout the target network
AIMX	in this paper we propose a convex formulation for supervised learning in the direct inference paradigm that overcomes both of the limitations mentioned above
OWNX	we show that a slight relaxation of this formulation bears surprising similarities with the supervised approach of  citation , in the sense that it amounts to defining a kernel between pairs of proteins from a kernel between individual proteins
OWNX	we therefore call our method the  metric learning pairwise kernel  (mlpk)
MISC	an important property of this formulation as an svm is the possibility to learn from several data types simultaneously by combining kernels, which is of particular importance in various bioinformatics applications  citation
OWNX	we validate the mlpk approach on the task of reconstructing two yeast networks: the network of metabolic pathways and the co-complex network
MISC	in each case, the network is inferred from a variety of genomic and proteomic data, including protein amino acid sequences, gene expression levels over a large set of experiments, and protein cellular localization
OWNX	we show that the mlpk approach nearly always provides better prediction performance than the state-of-the-art tppk approach
MISC	one property of networks that has received comparatively little attention is hierarchy, ie , the property of having vertices that cluster together in groups, which then join to form groups of groups, and so forth, up through all levels of organization in the network
MISC	by applying this approach to two example networks, we demonstrate its advantages for the interpretation of network data, the annotation of graphs with edge, vertex and community properties, and the generation of generic null models for further hypothesis testing
MISC	networks or graphs provide a useful mathematical representation of a broad variety of complex systems, from the world wide web and the internet to social, biochemical, and ecological systems
MISC	the last decade has seen a surge of interest across the sciences in the study of networks, including both empirical studies of particular networked systems and the development of new techniques and models for their analysis and interpretation~ citation
MISC	within the mathematical sciences, researchers have focused on the statistical characterization of network structure, and, at times, on producing descriptive generative mechanisms of simple structures
MISC	this approach, in which scientists have focused on statistical summaries of network structure, such as path lengths~ citation , degree distributions~ citation , and correlation coefficients~ citation , stands in contrast with, for example, the work on networks in the social and biological sciences, where the focus is instead on the properties of individual vertices or groups
MISC	more recently, researchers in both areas have become more interested in the global organization of networks~ citation
MISC	one property of real-world networks that has received comparatively little attention is that of  hierarchy , i e , the observation that networks often have a fractal-like structure in which vertices cluster together into groups that then join to form groups of groups, and so forth, from the lowest levels of organization up to the level of the entire network
OWNX	we then describe an approach for learning such models from real network data, based on maximum likelihood methods and markov chain monte carlo sampling
OWNX	in addition to inferring global structure from graph data, our method allows the researcher to annotate a graph with community structure, edge strength, and vertex affiliation information
OWNX	at its heart, our method works by sampling hierarchical structures with probability proportional to the likelihood with which they produce the input graph
MISC	this allows us to contemplate the ensemble of random graphs that are statistically similar to the original graph, and, through it, to measure various average network properties in manner reminiscent of bayesian model averaging
OWNX	in particular, we can   search for the maximum likelihood hierarchical model of a particular graph, which can then be used as a  null model  for further hypothesis testing,  derive a consensus hierarchical structure from the ensemble of sampled models, where hierarchical features are weighted by their likelihood, and  annotate an edge, or the absence of an edge, as ``surprising'' to the extent that it occurs with low probability in the ensemble
OWNX	to our knowledge, this method is the only one that offers such information about a network
MISC	moreover, this information can easily be represented in a human-readable format, providing a compact visualization of important organizational features of the network, which will be a useful tool for practitioners in generating new hypotheses about the organization of networks
OWNX	here, we study the class  symbol  of  rational stochastic languages , which consists in stochastic languages that can be generated by  multiplicity automata  (ma) and which strictly includes the class of stochastic languages generated by pa
OWNX	we design an efficient inference algorithm dees which aims at building a minimal normal representation of the target
OWNX	despite the fact that no recursively enumerable class of ma computes exactly  symbol , we show that dees strongly identifies  symbol  in the limit
OWNX	we study the intermediary ma output by dees and show that they compute rational series which converge absolutely to one and which can be used to provide stochastic languages which closely estimate the target
OWNX	then, an usual goal is to try to infer an estimate of this distribution law in some class of probabilistic models, such as  probabilistic automata  (pa), which have the same expressivity as hidden markov models (hmm)
MISC	pa are identifiable in the limit~ citation
OWNX	however, to our knowledge, there exists no efficient inference algorithm able to deal with the whole class of stochastic languages that can be generated from pa
OWNX	in the other hand, probabilistic automata are particular cases of  multiplicity automata , and stochastic languages which can be generated by multiplicity automata are special cases of  rational languages  that we call  rational stochastic languages
MISC	let us design by  symbol , the class of rational stochastic languages over the semiring  symbol
MISC	when  symbol  or  symbol ,  symbol  is exactly the class of stochastic languages generated by pa with parameters in  symbol
MISC	however, the class  symbol  presents a serious drawback : there exists no recursively enumerable subset of ma which exactly generates it~ citation
MISC	however, we show that  symbol  is strongly identifiable in the limit: we design an algorithm dees such that, for any target  symbol  and given access to an infinite sample  symbol  drawn according to  symbol , will converge in a finite but unbounded number of steps to a minimal normal representation of  symbol
OWNX	the question is: what kind of guarantees do we have on these intermediary hypotheses and how can we use them for a probabilistic inference purpose
OWNX	we show that, since the algorithm aims at building a minimal normal representation of the target, the intermediary hypotheses  symbol  output by dees have a nice property: they absolutely converge to 1, i e symbol  and  symbol
MISC	as a consequence,  symbol  is defined without ambiguity for any  symbol , and it can be shown that  symbol  tends to 0 as the learning proceeds
MISC	given any such series  symbol , we can efficiently compute a stochastic language  symbol , which is not rational, but has the property that  symbol  for any word  symbol  such that  symbol
OWNX	classical notions on stochastic languages, rational series, and multiplicity automata are recalled in section~
OWNX	we introduce our inference algorithm dees in section~ and we show that  symbol  is strongly indentifiable in the limit
OWNX	we study the properties of the ma output by dees in section~ and we show that they define absolutely convergent rational series which can be used to compute stochastic languages which are estimates of the target
MISC	samples of the standard cauchy  symbol
MISC	because of the impossibility results,  one can not hope to recover the pairwise  symbol  distances in  symbol  from  symbol ,  using linear estimators without incurring large errors
MISC	however, nonlinear estimators are still useful for certain applications in data stream computation, information retrieval, learning, and data mining
OWNX	we propose three types of nonlinear estimators: the bias-corrected sample median estimator, the bias-corrected geometric mean estimator, and the bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimator
MISC	the sample median estimator and the geometric mean estimator are asymptotically (as  symbol ) equivalent but the latter is more accurate at small  symbol
OWNX	we derive explicit tail bounds for the geometric mean estimator and establish an analog of the johnson-lindenstrauss  (jl) lemma for dimension reduction in  symbol , which is weaker than the classical jl lemma for dimension reduction in  symbol
MISC	asymptotically, both the sample median estimator and the geometric mean estimators are about  symbol  efficient compared to the maximum likelihood estimator (mle)
OWNX	we analyze the moments of the mle and propose approximating the distribution of the mle by an  inverse gaussian
MISC	the idea of  linear random projections  is to multiply the original data matrix  symbol  with a random projection matrix  symbol , resulting in a projected matrix  symbol
MISC	if  symbol , then it should be much more efficient to compute certain summary statistics (e g , pairwise distances) from   symbol  as opposed to  symbol
MISC	moreover,  symbol  may be small  enough to reside in physical memory while  symbol  is often too large to fit in the main memory
MISC	citation  proposed constructing  symbol  from   iid 
MISC	in the stable distribution family  citation , normal is 2-stable and cauchy is 1-stable
OWNX	thus, we will call random projections for  symbol  and  symbol ,   normal random projections  and  cauchy random projections , respectively
OWNX	we will review  normal random projections  in more detail in section
MISC	the impossibility results  citation  have proved that one can not hope to recover the  symbol  distance using linear projections and linear estimators (e g , sample mean), without incurring large errors
MISC	fortunately, the impossibility results do not rule out nonlinear estimators, which may be still useful in certain applications in data stream computation, information retrieval, learning, and data mining
OWNX	in this study, we provide three types of nonlinear estimators:  the bias-corrected sample median estimator, the bias-corrected geometric mean estimator, and the bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimator
MISC	the sample median estimator and the geometric mean estimator are asymptotically equivalent (i e , both are about  symbol  efficient as the maximum likelihood estimator), but the latter is more accurate at small sample size  symbol
OWNX	furthermore, we derive explicit tail bounds for the bias-corrected geometric mean estimator and establish an analog of the  jl lemma for dimension reduction in  symbol
MISC	many efficient algorithms, such as some sub-linear time (using super-linear memory) nearest neighbor algorithms  citation , rely on the metric properties (e g , the triangle inequality)
OWNX	nevertheless, nonlinear estimators may be still useful in important scenarios
MISC	estimating  symbol  distances online  \\ the original data matrix  symbol  requires  symbol  storage space; and hence it is often too large for physical memory
MISC	the storage cost of all pairwise distances is  symbol , which may be also too large for the  memory
MISC	for example, in information retrieval,  symbol  could be the total number of  word types or documents at web scale
MISC	to avoid page fault, it may be more efficient to estimate the distances on the fly from the  projected data matrix  symbol  in the memory
MISC	using  cauchy random projections , the cost can be reduced to  symbol
MISC	because  symbol , the savings could be enormous
OWNX	linear scan nearest neighbor searching \\ we can always search for the nearest neighbors by linear scans
MISC	when working with the projected data matrix  symbol  (which is in the  memory), the cost of searching for the nearest neighbor for one data point is time  symbol , which may be still significantly faster than the sub-linear algorithms working with the original data matrix  symbol  (which is often on the disk)
OWNX	we briefly comment on  coordinate sampling , another strategy for dimension reduction
MISC	given a data matrix  symbol , one can randomly sample  symbol  columns from  symbol  and estimate the summary statistics (including  symbol  and  symbol  distances)
MISC	despite its simplicity, there are two major disadvantages in coordinate sampling
MISC	first, there is no performance guarantee
OWNX	for  heavy-tailed data, we may have to choose  symbol  very large in order to achieve sufficient accuracy
MISC	for non-sparse data, however, methods based on  linear  random projections  are superior
OWNX	section  reviews  linear random projections
OWNX	section  summarizes the main results for three types of nonlinear estimators
OWNX	section  presents the sample median estimators
OWNX	section  concerns the geometric mean estimators
OWNX	section  is devoted to the maximum likelihood estimators
OWNX	we define a set of high-level observation and action modules
MISC	actions are temporally extended, and multiple action modules may be in effect concurrently
MISC	a decision of the agent is represented as a rule-based policy
OWNX	for learning, we apply the cross-entropy method, a recent global optimization algorithm
MISC	the learned policies reached better score than the hand-crafted policy, and neared the score of average human players
MISC	we argue that learning is successful mainly because (i) the policy space includes the combination of individual actions and thus it is sufficiently rich, (ii) the search is biased towards low-complexity policies and low complexity solutions can be found quickly if they exist
OWNX	based on these principles, we formulate a new theoretical framework, which can be found in the appendix as supporting material
MISC	during the last two decades, reinforcement learning has reached a mature state, and has been laid on solid foundations
MISC	the basic properties of many such algorithms are relatively well understood (e g conditions for convergence, complexity, effect of various parameters etc ), although it is needless to say that there are still lots of important open questions
MISC	there are also plenty of test problems (like various maze-navigation tasks, pole-balancing, car on the hill etc ) on which the capabilities of rl algorithms have been demonstrated, and the number of successful large-scale rl applications is also growing steadily
MISC	however, there is still a sore need for more successful applications to validate the place of rl as a major branch of artificial intelligence
OWNX	we think that games (including the diverse set of classical board games, card games, modern computer games etc ) are ideal test environments for reinforcement learning
MISC	games are intended to be interesting and challenging for human intelligence and therefore, they are ideal means to explore what artificial intelligence is still missing
MISC	furthermore, most games fit well into the rl paradigm: they are goal-oriented sequential decision problems, where each decision can have long-term effect
MISC	in many cases, hidden information, random events, unknown environment, known, or unknown players account for (part of) the difficulty of playing the game
MISC	such circumstances are in the focus of the reinforcement learning idea
MISC	there is another great advantage of games as test problems: the rules of the games are fixed, so the danger of `tailoring the task to the algorithm' -- i e , to tweak the rules and/or the environment so that they meet the capabilities of the proposed rl algorithm -- is reduced, compared, eg , to various maze navigation tasks
MISC	rl has been tried in many classical games, including checkers  citation , backgammon  citation , and chess  citation
MISC	on the other hand, modern computer games got into the spotlight only recently, and there are not very many successful attempts to learn them with ai tools
MISC	these games are also interesting from the point of view of rl, as they catch different aspects of human intelligence: instead of deep and wide logical deduction chains, most modern computer games need short-term strategies, but many observations have to be considered in parallel, and both the observation space and the action space can be huge
OWNX	in this spirit, we decided to investigate the arcade game pac-man
OWNX	the game is interesting on its own, as it is largely unsolved, but also imposes several important questions in rl, which we will overview in section~
OWNX	we will show that a hybrid approach is more successful than either tabula rasa learning or a hand-coded strategy alone
OWNX	for learning, we will apply the cross-entropy method, a recently developed general optimization algorithm
OWNX	in the next section we overview the pac-man game and the related literature
OWNX	in sections  and  we give a short description of rule-based policies and the cross-entropy optimization method, respectively
OWNX	in section  we describe the details of the learning experiments, and in section  we present our results
OWNX	finally, in section  we summarize and discuss our approach with an emphasis on its implications for other rl problems
OWNX	the hedged predictions for the labels of new objects include quantitative measures of their own accuracy and reliability
MISC	these measures are provably valid under the assumption of randomness, traditional in machine learning: the objects and their labels are assumed to be generated independently from the same probability distribution
OWNX	in particular, it becomes possible to control (up to statistical fluctuations) the number of erroneous predictions by selecting a suitable confidence level
MISC	a typical drawback of the new techniques is the lack of useful measures of confidence in their predictions
MISC	for example, some of the tightest upper bounds of the popular pac theory on the probability of error exceed~1 even for relatively clean data sets ( citation , p ~249)
OWNX	appropriately chosen, not only are these measures valid and informative, but they also take full account of the special features of the object to be predicted
OWNX	we call our algorithms for producing hedged predictions ``conformal predictors''; they are formally introduced in section
MISC	their most important property is the automatic validity under the randomness assumption (to be discussed shortly)
MISC	informally, validity means that conformal predictors never overrate the accuracy and reliability of their predictions
MISC	admittedly, this is a strong assumption, and areas of machine learning are emerging that rely on other assumptions (such as the markovian assumption of reinforcement learning; see, eg ,  citation ) or dispense with any stochastic assumptions altogether (competitive on-line learning; see, eg ,  citation )
MISC	it is, however, much weaker than assuming a parametric statistical model, sometimes complemented with a prior distribution on the parameter space, which is customary in the statistical theory of prediction
MISC	and taking into account the strength of the guarantees that can be proved under this assumption, it does not appear overly restrictive
OWNX	so we know that conformal predictors tell the truth
MISC	clearly, this is not enough: truth can be uninformative and so useless
MISC	virtually any classification or regression algorithm can be transformed into a conformal predictor, and so most of the arsenal of methods of modern machine learning can be brought to bear on the design of efficient conformal predictors
MISC	this ``universal predictor'' produces the best possible hedged predictions but, unfortunately, is noncomputable
OWNX	in section  we formally introduce the notion of conformal predictors and state a simple result about their validity
OWNX	in that section we also briefly describe results of computer experiments demonstrating the methodology of conformal prediction
OWNX	in section  we describe the ``on-line'' setting of the problem of prediction, and in section  contrast it with the more standard ``batch'' setting
OWNX	the notion of validity introduced in section  is applicable to both settings, but in the on-line setting it can be strengthened: we can now prove that the percentage of the erroneous predictions will be close, with high probability, to a chosen confidence level
OWNX	in section  we also discuss limitations of the on-line setting and introduce new settings intermediate between on-line and batch
MISC	to a large degree, conformal predictors still enjoy the stronger property of validity for the intermediate settings
OWNX	section  is devoted to the discussion of the difference between two kinds of inference from empirical data, induction and transduction (emphasized by vladimir vapnik  citation )
OWNX	we show how some popular methods of machine learning can be used as underlying algorithms for hedged prediction
OWNX	we do not give the full description of these methods and refer the reader to the existing readily accessible descriptions
OWNX	we hope that the information we provide will enable the reader to apply our hedging techniques to their favourite machine-learning methods
MISC	surprisingly, a discrete partition of continuous state space can produce a coarse-grained description of the behavior that accurately describes the invariant properties of an underlying chaotic attractor
MISC	research on chaotic dynamical systems during the last forty years produced a new vision of the origins of randomness
MISC	it is now widely understood that observed randomness can be generated by low-dimensional deterministic systems that exhibit a chaotic attractor
MISC	today, when confronted with what appears to be a high-dimensional stochastic process, one now asks whether or not the process is instead a hidden low-dimensional, but nonlinear dynamical system
MISC	this awareness, though, requires a new way of looking at apparently random data since chaotic dynamics are very sensitive to the measurement process~ citation , which is both a blessing and a curse, as it turns out
MISC	symbolic dynamics, as one of a suite of tools in dynamical systems theory, in its most basic form addresses this issue by considering a coarse-grained view of a continuous dynamics ~  in this sense, any finite-precision instrument that measures a chaotic system induces a symbolic representation of the underlying continuous-valued behavior
MISC	to effectively model time series of discrete data from a continuous-state system two concerns must be addressed
OWNX	second, we must consider the inference of models based on this data
MISC	the relation between these steps is more subtle than one might expect
OWNX	as we will demonstrate, on the one hand, in the measurement of chaotic data, the instrument should be designed to maximize the entropy rate of the resulting data stream
MISC	this allows one to extract as much information from each measurement as possible
MISC	on the other hand, model inference strives to minimize the apparent randomness (entropy rate) over a class of alternative models
OWNX	we consider the design of binary-output instruments for chaotic maps with additive noise
OWNX	we then use bayesian inference of a  symbol -th order markov chain to model the resulting data stream
OWNX	to start we consider the design of instruments in the zero-noise limit
MISC	the construction of a symbolic dynamics representation of a continuous-state system goes as follows  citation
MISC	this space can partitioned into a finite set  symbol  of nonoverlapping regions in many ways
MISC	the most powerful is called a  markov partition  and must satisfy two conditions
MISC	first, the image of each region  symbol  must be a union of intervals:  symbol
MISC	second, the map  symbol , restricted to an interval, must be one-to-one and onto
MISC	if a markov partition cannot be found for the system under consideration, the next best coarse-graining is called a  generating partition
MISC	for one dimensional maps, these are often easily found using the extrema of  symbol ---its  critical points
MISC	the critical points in the map are used to divide the state space into intervals  symbol  over which  symbol  is monotone
MISC	given any partition  symbol , then, a series of continuous-valued states  symbol  can be projected onto its symbolic representation  symbol
OWNX	in the limit of infinite symbol sequences, the result is a discrete-symbol representation of a continuous-state system---a representation that, as we will show, is often much easier to analyze
MISC	from the block entropy the  entropy rate  can be estimated as the following limit  symbol } in practice it is often more accurate to calculate the length- symbol  estimate of the entropy rate using  symbol }  another key result in symbolic dynamics says that the entropy of the original continuous system is found using generating partitions  citation
MISC	in particular, the true entropy rate maximizes the estimated entropy rates:  symbol } thus, translated into a statement about experiment design, the results tell us to design an instrument so that it maximizes the observed entropy rate
MISC	notably, in the presence of noise no such theorems exist
MISC	however,  citation  demonstrated the methods developed above are robust in the presence of noise
OWNX	in any case, we view the output of the instrument as a stochastic process
OWNX	a sample realization  symbol  of length  symbol  with measurements taken from a finite alphabet is the basis for our inference problem:  symbol
OWNX	for our purposes here, the sample is generated by a partition of continuous-state sequences from iterations of a one-dimensional map and that states are on a chaotic attractor
OWNX	we assume, in addition, that the alphabet is binary  symbol
OWNX	our method is a generalized low rank matrix completion problem, where we learn a function whose inputs are pairs of vectors -- the standard low rank matrix completion problem being a special case where the inputs to the function are the row and column indices of the matrix
OWNX	we solve this generalized matrix completion problem using tensor product kernels for which we also formally generalize standard kernel properties
OWNX	benchmark experiments on movie ratings show the advantages of our generalized matrix completion method over the standard matrix completion one with no information about movies or people, as well as over standard multi-task or single task learning methods
MISC	collaborative filtering (cf) refers to the task of predicting preferences of a given user based on their previously known preferences as well as the preferences of other users
MISC	in a book recommender system, for example, one would like to suggest new books to a customer based on what he and others have recently read or purchased
MISC	this can be formulated as the problem of filling a matrix with customers as rows, objects (e g , books) as columns, and missing entries corresponding to preferences that one would like to infer
MISC	standard cf assumes that nothing is known about the users or the objects apart from the preferences expressed so far
MISC	in such a setting the most common assumption is that preferences can be decomposed into a small number of factors, both for users and objects, resulting in the search for a low-rank matrix which approximates the partially observed matrix of preferences
MISC	this problem is usually a difficult non-convex problem for which only heuristic algorithms exist~ citation
MISC	alternatively convex formulations have been obtained by relaxing the rank constraint by constraining the trace norm of the matrix~ citation
MISC	seen as learning a preference function from examples, this problem can be solved by virtually any algorithm for supervised classification or regression taking as input a pair (user, object)
OWNX	if we suppose for example that a positive definite kernel between pairs can be deduced from the description of the users and object, then learning algorithms like support vector machines or kernel ridge regression can be applied
MISC	these algorithms minimize an empirical risk over a ball of the reproducing kernel hilbert space (rkhs) defined by the pairwise kernel
MISC	both the rank constraint and the rkhs norm restriction act as regularization based on prior hypothesis about the nature of the preferences to be inferred
MISC	the rank constraint is based on the hypothesis that preferences can be modelled by a limited number or factors to describe users and objects
MISC	the rkhs norm constraint assumes that preferences vary smoothly between similar users and similar objects, where the similarity is assessed in terms of the kernel for pairs
OWNX	the main contribution of this work is to propose a framework which combines both regularizations on the one hand, and which interpolates between the pure cf approach and the pure attribute-based approaches on the other hand
OWNX	we show on a benchmark experiment of movie recommendations that the resulting algorithm can lead to significant improvements over other state-of-the-art methods
MISC	%   <- trailing '%' for backward compatibility of
OWNX	sty file  we propose a method for improving approximate inference methods that corrects for the influence of loops in the graphical model
MISC	it is an alternative implementation of an idea introduced recently by  citation
OWNX	indeed, we often observe that the loop corrected error is approximately the square of the error of the approximate inference method used to estimate the effect of loops
MISC	in recent years, much research has been done in the field of approximate inference on graphical models
MISC	one of the goals is to obtain accurate approximations of marginal probabilities of complex probability distributions defined over many variables, using limited computation time and memory
MISC	this research has led to a large number of approximate inference methods
MISC	to calculate the results of cvm and other region based approximation methods, one can use the generalized belief propagation (gbp) algorithm  citation  or double-loop algorithms that have guaranteed convergence  citation
MISC	it is well-known that belief propagation yields exact results if the graphical model is a tree, or, more generally, if each connected component is a tree
MISC	however, if the influence of loops is large, the approximate marginals calculated by bp can have large errors and the quality of the bp results may not be satisfactory
MISC	one way to correct for the influence of short loops is to increase the cluster size of the approximation, using cvm (gbp) with clusters that subsume as many loops as possible
MISC	however, choosing a good set of clusters is highly nontrivial  citation , and in general this method will only work if the clusters do not have many intersections, or in other words, if the loops do not have many intersections
OWNX	this corrects for the loops that consist of part of the base tree and exactly one additional factor and yields good results if the graphical model is dominated by the base tree, which is the case in very sparse models
MISC	hence, for  denser models, the improvement of treeep over bp usually diminishes
OWNX	in this article we propose a method that takes into account  all  the loops in the graphical model in an approximate way and therefore obtains more accurate results in many cases
MISC	the basic idea is to first estimate the cavity distributions of all variables and subsequently improve these estimates by cancelling out errors using certain consistency constraints
MISC	the removal of the factors breaks all the loops in which that variable takes part
MISC	this allows an approximate inference algorithm to estimate the strength of these loops in terms of effective interactions or correlations between the variables of the markov blanket
MISC	then, the influence of the removed factors is taken into account, which yields accurate approximations to the probability distributions of the original graphical model
MISC	even more accuracy is obtained by imposing certain consistency relations between the cavity distributions, which results in a cancellation of errors to some extent
MISC	indeed, the assumption that no loops are present, or equivalently, that the cavity distributions factorize, yields the bp / minimal cvm results
OWNX	although the basic idea underlying our method is very similar to that described in  citation , the alternative implementation that we propose here offers two advantages
MISC	most importantly, it is directly applicable to arbitrary factor graphs, whereas the original method has only been formulated for the rather special case of graphical models with binary variables and pairwise factors, which excludes eg \ many interesting bayesian networks
OWNX	furthermore, our implementation appears to be more robust and also gives improved results for relatively strong interactions, as will be shown numerically
OWNX	first we explain the theory behind our proposed method and discuss the differences with the original method by  citation
OWNX	finally, we discuss the results and state conclusions
MISC	approximation of the optimal two-part mdl code for given data, through successive  monotonically length-decreasing two-part mdl codes, has the following properties: (i) computation of each step may take arbitrarily long; (ii) we may not know when we reach the optimum, or whether we will reach the optimum at all; (iii) the sequence of models generated may not monotonically improve the goodness of fit;  but (iv) the model associated with the optimum has (almost) the best goodness of fit
MISC	in machine learning pure applications of mdl are rare, partially because of the difficulties one encounters trying to define an adequate model code and data-to-model code, and partially because of the operational difficulties that are poorly understood
OWNX	we analyze aspects of both the power and the perils of  mdl precisely and formally
OWNX	let us first resurrect a familiar problem from our childhood to illustrate some of the issues involved
OWNX	gradually we combine pieces, thus reducing the entropy and increasing the order until the puzzle is solved
OWNX	in this last stage we have found a maximal ordering
MISC	on the other hand the information about the shape of the pieces can only be used in a relatively late stage of the puzzle process
MISC	bob's effort in the beginning is a waste of time, because he must reorder the pieces before he can proceed to solve the puzzle
MISC	this example shows that if the solution of a problem depends on finding a  maximal  reduction of entropy this does not mean that  every  reduction of entropy brings us closer to the solution
MISC	kohonen self-organisation maps are a well know classification tool, commonly used  in a wide variety of problems, but with limited applications in time series  forecasting context
MISC	time series forecasting is a problem encountered in many fields of applications,  as finance (returns, stock markets), hydrology (river floods), engineering (electrical  consumption), etc
MISC	many methods designed for time series forecasting perform well  (depending on the complexity of the problem) on a rather short-term horizon but are rather poor on a longer-term one
MISC	this is due to the fact that these methods are  usually designed to optimize the performance at short term, their use at longer  term being not optimized
MISC	furthermore, they generally carry out the prediction of a single value while the real problem sometimes requires predicting a vector of  future values in one step
MISC	for example, in the case of some a priori known periodicity,  it could be interesting to predict all values for a period as a whole
MISC	but forecasting  a vector requires either more complex models (with potential loss of performance for some of the vector components) or many distinct single value predicting models  (with potential loss of the correlation information between the various values)
MISC	methods able to forecast a whole vector with the same precision for each of its  components are thus of great interest
MISC	the limitation is due to the availability of the information  itself, and not to possible limitations of the forecasting methods
MISC	indeed, there is no  doubt that, whatever forecasting method is used, predicting at long term (i e many time  steps in advance) is more difficult that predicting at short term, because of the missing  information in the unknown future time steps (those between the last known value and  the one to predict)
MISC	at some term, all prediction methods will thus fail
MISC	by insights, we mean  some information of interest to the practitioner, even if it does not mean accurate  predictions
MISC	for example, are there bounds on the future values
OWNX	what can we  expect in average
MISC	are confidence intervals on future values large or narrow
MISC	predicting many steps in advance could be realized in a straightforward way, by subsampling the known sequence, then using any short-term prediction method
MISC	however, in this case, the loss of information (used for the forecast) is obviously even higher, due to the lower  resolution of the known sequence
MISC	the predictions should  differ; a stochastic prediction method is able to generate several forecasts by repeated  monte-carlo runs
OWNX	another attractive aspect of the method presented in this paper is that it can be used  to predict scalar values or vectors, with the same expected precision for each component  in the case of vector prediction
MISC	having at disposal a time series of values  symbol  with   symbol , the prediction of a vector can be defined as follows :  symbol } where  symbol  is the size of the vector to be predicted,  symbol  is the data generating process,   symbol  is the number of past values that influence the future values and  symbol   is a centred noise vector
MISC	the past values are gathered in a  symbol -dimensional vector called  regressor
MISC	the knowledge of  symbol  values of the time series (with  symbol  and  symbol ) means that  relation () is known for many ( symbol ) time steps in the past
OWNX	the idea of the method is to segment the space of  symbol -dimensional regressors
MISC	this part of the method is achieved using the self-organizing map (som)  citation
OWNX	the prototypes obtained for each class model locally the regressors of the corresponding  class
MISC	furthermore, in order to take into account temporal dependences in the series,  deformation regressors are built
MISC	once those two spaces are segmented and their dependences characterized, simulations  can be performed
MISC	using a kind of monte-carlo procedure to repeat the simulations, it is  then possible to estimate the distribution of these simulations and to forecast global trends of the time series at long term
OWNX	though we could have chosen some other classical vector quantization (vq) method as only  the clustering property is of interest here, the choice of the som tool to perform  the segmentation  of the two spaces is justified by the fact that som are efficient  and fast compared to other vq methods with a limited complexity  citation  and  that they provide an intuitive and helpful graphical representation
OWNX	then we introduce the proposed forecasting method, the double  vector quantization, for scalar time series and then for vector ones
OWNX	next we present  some experimental results for both scalar and vector forecastings
MISC	because query execution is the most crucial part of inductive logic programming (ilp) algorithms, a lot of effort is invested in developing faster execution mechanisms
MISC	these execution mechanisms typically have a low-level implementation, making them hard to debug
OWNX	moreover, other factors such as the complexity of the problems handled by ilp algorithms and size of the code base of ilp data mining systems make debugging at this level a very difficult job
OWNX	in this work, we present the trace-based debugging approach currently used in the development of new execution mechanisms in hipp, the engine underlying the ace data mining system
MISC	this debugger uses the delta debugging algorithm to automatically reduce the total time  needed to expose bugs in ilp execution, thus making manual debugging step much lighter
MISC	data mining  citation  is the process of finding patterns that describe a large set of data best
MISC	inductive logic programming (ilp)   citation  is a multi-relational data mining approach, which uses the logic programming paradigm as its basis
MISC	ilp uses a generate-and-test approach, where in each iteration a large set of hypotheses (or `queries') has to be evaluated on the data (also called `examples')
MISC	based on the results of this evaluation, the ilp  process selects the ``best'' hypotheses and refines them further
MISC	due to the size of the data of the problems handled by ilp,  the underlying query evaluation engine (e g a prolog system) is a crucial part of a real life ilp system
MISC	the development of new execution mechanisms for ilp happens mainly in the engine of the ilp system
MISC	these optimized execution strategies typically require a low level implementation to yield significant benefits
MISC	for example, the query pack~ citation  and adpack~ citation   execution mechanisms require the introduction of new dedicated wam instructions, together with a set of new data structures which these instructions use and manipulate
MISC	because of their low-level nature, finding bugs  in the implementation of these execution mechanisms is very hard
MISC	while tracing bugs in these low-level implementations  might still be feasible for small test programs, many  bugs  only appear during the execution of the ilp algorithm on real life data sets
MISC	several factors make debugging in this situation difficult:    the size of the ilp system itself
MISC	real life ilp systems group the implementation of many algorithms into one big system
OWNX	these systems therefore often have a very large code base
MISC	for example, the ace system~ citation  consists of over 150000 lines of code
MISC	the complexity/size of the ilp problem
MISC	with large datasets,  it can take a very long time (hours, even days) before a specific bug occurs
MISC	when debugging, one typically performs multiple  runs with small modifications to pin-point the exact problem, and so long execution times make this approach infeasible
MISC	while the evaluation of hypotheses is often the bottleneck, some algorithms  (such as rule learners) have a very expensive hypothesis generation  phase
MISC	this phase is independent from the execution of the queries itself, and as such has no influence on the exposure of the bug
MISC	for algorithms with a very complex hypothesis generation, it can take a  very long time for the bug in the execution mechanism to expose itself, even when the time spent on executing these queries is small
MISC	if an ilp algorithm makes  random decisions (typically in the hypothesis generation phase), the  exact point in time where the bug occurs changes from run to run
MISC	it is even possible that the bug does not occur at all in certain runs
OWNX	in  citation , we proposed a trace-based approach for analyzing and debugging ilp data mining execution
MISC	this approach allowed easy and fast debugging of the underlying query execution engines,  independent of the ilp algorithm causing the bug to appear
OWNX	in this work, we present an extension to this debugging approach, automating a large part of the debugging process
OWNX	section~ discusses the collection of the run-time information necessary for our trace-based debugging approach
OWNX	section~ then discusses applying the delta debugging algorithm on these traces to allow fast and easy debugging
OWNX	we briefly discuss the  implementation of our delta debugger in section~
OWNX	finally, we conclude in section~
OWNX	we bound the future loss when predicting any (computably) stochastic sequence online
MISC	solomonoff finitely bounded the total deviation of his universal predictor  symbol  from the true distribution  symbol  by the algorithmic complexity of  symbol
OWNX	here we assume that we are at a time  symbol  and have already observed  symbol
MISC	the new complexity is monotone in its condition in the sense that this complexity can only decrease if the condition is prolonged
OWNX	we also briefly discuss potential generalizations to bayesian model classes and to classification problems
OWNX	we consider the problem of online=sequential predictions
MISC	bayesians proceed by considering a class  symbol  of models=hypotheses=distributions, sufficiently large such that  symbol , and a prior over  symbol
MISC	solomonoff considered the truly large class that contains all computable probability distributions~ citation
MISC	he showed that his universal distribution  symbol  converges rapidly to  symbol ~ citation , i e \ predicts well in any environment as long as it is computable or can be modeled by a computable probability distribution (all physical theories are of this sort)
MISC	symbol  is roughly  symbol , where  symbol  is the length of the shortest description of  symbol , called the kolmogorov complexity of  symbol
MISC	since  symbol  and  symbol  are incomputable, they have to be approximated in practice
MISC	see eg ~ citation  and references therein
MISC	the universality of  symbol  also precludes useful statements about the prediction quality at particular time instances~ symbol ~ citation , as opposed to simple classes like  iid  \ sequences (data) of size  symbol , where accuracy is typically  symbol
MISC	luckily, bounds on the expected  total =cumulative loss (e g \ number of prediction errors) for  symbol  can be derived~ citation , which is often sufficient in an online setting
MISC	the bounds are in terms of the (kolmogorov) complexity of  symbol
MISC	for instance, for deterministic  symbol , the number of errors is (in a sense tightly) bounded by  symbol  which measures in this case the information (in bits) in the observed infinite sequence~ symbol
MISC	if the total loss is finite, the future loss must necessarily be small for large  symbol
MISC	if the complexity of  symbol  bounds the total loss, a natural guess is that something like the conditional complexity of  symbol  given  symbol  bounds the future loss (if  symbol  contains a lot of (or even all) information about  symbol , we should make fewer (no) errors anymore ) indeed, we prove two bounds of this kind but with additional terms describing structural properties of  symbol
MISC	these additional terms appear since the total loss is bounded only in expectation, and hence the future loss is small only for ``most''  symbol
MISC	the advantage is that the deficiency is small for ``typical''  symbol  and bounded on average (in contrast to the length)
MISC	but in this case the conventional conditional complexity turned out to be unsuitable
OWNX	so we introduce a new natural modification of conditional kolmogorov complexity, which is monotone as a function of condition
MISC	informally speaking, we require programs (=descriptions) to be consistent in the sense that if a program generates some  symbol  given  symbol , then it must generate the same  symbol  given any prolongation of  symbol
MISC	the new posterior bounds also significantly improve upon the previous total bounds
OWNX	in section~ we prove and discuss the length-based bound theorem~
OWNX	in section~ we show why a new definition of complexity is necessary and formulate the deficiency-based bound theorem~
OWNX	we discuss the definition and basic properties of the new complexity in section~, and prove theorem~ in section~
OWNX	we briefly discuss potential generalizations to general model classes  symbol  and classification in the concluding section~
OWNX	we show that joint estimation/prediction based on the reweighted sum-product algorithm substantially outperforms a commonly used heuristic based on ordinary sum-product
MISC	graphical models such as markov random fields (mrfs) are widely used in many application domains, including spatial statistics, statistical signal processing, and communication theory
MISC	a fundamental limitation to their practical use is the infeasibility of computing various statistical quantities (e g , marginals, data likelihoods etc ); such quantities are of interest both bayesian and frequentist settings
MISC	a disadvantage of sampling methods is their relatively high computational cost
MISC	for instance, in applications with severe limits on delay and computational overhead (e g , error-control coding, real-time tracking, video compression), mcmc methods are likely to be overly slow
MISC	it is thus of considerable interest for various application domains to consider less computationally intensive methods for generating approximations to marginals, log likelihoods, and other relevant statistical quantities
MISC	variational methods are one class of techniques that can be used to generate deterministic approximations in markov random fields (mrfs)
MISC	at the foundation of these methods is the fact that for a broad class of mrfs, the computation of the log likelihood and marginal probabilities can be reformulated as a convex optimization problem (see~ citation  for an overview)
MISC	in many cases, optimization of the relaxed problem can be carried out by ``message-passing'' algorithms, in which neighboring nodes in the markov random field convey statistical information (e g , likelihoods) by passing functions or vectors (referred to as messages)
AIMX	a direct approach---for instance, via (regularized) maximum likelihood estimation---entails evaluating the cumulant generating (or log partition) function, which is computationally intractable for general markov random fields
MISC	one viable option is the pseudolikelihood method~ citation , which can be shown to produce consistent parameter estimates under suitable assumptions, though with an associated loss of statistical efficiency
MISC	other researchers have studied algorithms for ml estimation based on stochastic approximation~ citation , which again are consistent under appropriate assumptions, but can be slow to converge
MISC	sequential decision theory formally solves the problem of rational agents in uncertain worlds if the true environmental prior probability distribution is known
OWNX	we outline how the aixi model can formally solve a number of problem classes, including sequence prediction, strategic games, function minimization, reinforcement and supervised learning
MISC	the major drawback of the aixi model is that it is uncomputable
MISC	the computation time of aixi symbol  is of the order  symbol
OWNX	we present the aixi model, a parameter-free optimal reinforcement learning agent embedded in an arbitrary unknown environment
MISC	the science of artificial intelligence (ai) may be defined as the construction of intelligent systems and their analysis
MISC	a natural definition of a  system  is anything that has an input and an output stream
MISC	intelligence is more complicated
MISC	it can have many faces like creativity, solving problems, pattern recognition, classification, learning, induction, deduction, building analogies, optimization, surviving in an environment, language processing, knowledge and many more
MISC	a formal definition incorporating every aspect of intelligence, however, seems difficult
MISC	most, if not all known facets of intelligence can be formulated as goal-driven or, more precisely, as maximizing some utility function
MISC	it is, therefore, sufficient to study goal-driven ai; eg \ the (biological) goal of animals and humans is to survive and spread
MISC	the goal of ai systems should be to be useful to humans
OWNX	the problem is that, except for special cases, we know neither the utility function nor the environment in which the agent will operate in advance
MISC	assume the availability of unlimited computational resources
MISC	playing chess optimally or solving np-complete problems become trivial, but driving a car or surviving in nature don't
MISC	in other words: the ai problem has not yet been well defined
MISC	one may view aixi as a suggestion for such a mathematical definition of ai
MISC	aixi is a universal theory of sequential decision making akin to solomonoff's celebrated universal theory of induction
MISC	solomonoff derived an optimal way of predicting future data, given previous perceptions, provided the data is sampled from a computable probability distribution
MISC	aixi extends this approach to an optimal decision making agent embedded in an unknown environment
MISC	the  main idea  is to replace the unknown environmental distribution  symbol  in the bellman equations by a suitably generalized universal solomonoff distribution  symbol
MISC	aixi is a universal theory without adjustable parameters, making no assumptions about the environment except that it is sampled from a computable distribution
MISC	from an algorithmic complexity perspective, the aixi model generalizes optimal passive universal induction to the case of active agents
OWNX	we outline for a number of problem classes, including sequence prediction, strategic games, function minimization, reinforcement and supervised learning, how the aixi model can formally solve them
MISC	the major drawback of the aixi model is that it is incomputable
MISC	the computation time of aixi symbol  is of the order  symbol
MISC	other discussed topics are a formal definition of an intelligence order relation, the horizon problem and relations of the aixi theory to other ai approaches
OWNX	for a mathematically rigorous treatment, many subtleties, and proofs see the references to the author's works in the annotated bibliography section at the end of this chapterarticle\fi, and in particular the book  citation
MISC	presents the theory of sequential decisions in a very general form (called ai symbol  model) in which actions and perceptions may depend on arbitrary past events
OWNX	we clarify the connection to the bellman equations and discuss minor parameters including (the size of) the i/o spaces and the lifetime of the agent and their universal choice which we have in mind
MISC	how and in which sense induction is possible at all has been subject to long philosophical controversies
MISC	highlights are epicurus' principle of multiple explanations, occam's razor, and probability theory
MISC	solomonoff elegantly unified all these aspects into one formal theory of inductive inference based on a universal probability distribution  symbol , which is closely related to kolmogorov complexity  symbol , the length of the shortest program computing  symbol
MISC	rapid convergence of  symbol  to the unknown true environmental distribution  symbol  and tight loss bounds for arbitrary bounded loss functions and finite alphabet can be shown
MISC	pareto optimality of  symbol  in the sense that there is no other predictor that performs better or equal in all environments and strictly better in at least one can also be shown
MISC	in view of these results it is fair to say that the problem of sequence prediction possesses a universally optimal solution
MISC	in the active case, reinforcement learning algorithms are usually used if  symbol  is unknown
MISC	they can succeed if the state space is either small or has effectively been made small by generalization techniques
MISC	the algorithms work only in restricted (e g \ markovian) domains, have problems with optimally trading off exploration versus exploitation, have nonoptimal learning rate, are prone to diverge, or are otherwise ad hoc
OWNX	the formal solution proposed here is to generalize solomonoff's universal prior  symbol  to include action conditions and replace  symbol  by  symbol  in the ai symbol  model, resulting in the ai symbol aixi model, which we claim to be universally optimal
OWNX	we investigate what we can expect from a universally optimal agent and clarify the meanings of  universal ,  optimal , etc
OWNX	we show how a number of ai problem classes fit into the general aixi model
MISC	they include sequence prediction, strategic games, function minimization, and supervised learning
OWNX	we then consider the consequences of replacing  symbol  by  symbol
MISC	the main goal is to understand in which sense the problems are solved by aixi
MISC	the major drawback of aixi is that it is incomputable, or more precisely, only asymptotically computable, which makes an implementation impossible
MISC	the computation time of aixi symbol  is of the order  symbol
MISC	the solution requires an implementation of first-order logic, the definition of a universal turing machine within it and a proof theory system
OWNX	finally we discuss and remark on some otherwise unmentioned topics of general interest
OWNX	we remark on various topics, including concurrent actions and perceptions, the choice of the i/o spaces, treatment of encrypted information, and peculiarities of mortal embodies agents
OWNX	we continue with an outlook on further research, including optimality, down-scaling, implementation, approximation, elegance, extra knowledge, and training of/for aixi( symbol )
OWNX	we also include some (personal) remarks on non-computable physics, the number of wisdom  symbol , and consciousness
MISC	the proposed strategies are consistent in the sense that they achieve, asymptotically, the best possible average reward among all fixed actions
MISC	it was rustichini  citation  who first proved the existence of such consistent predictors
OWNX	we also establish upper bounds for the rates of convergence
MISC	in the case of deterministic feedback signals, these rates are optimal up to logarithmic terms
MISC	in sequential decision problems a decision maker (or forecaster) tries to predict the outcome of a certain unknown process at each (discrete) time instance and  takes an action accordingly
MISC	depending on the outcome of the predicted event and the action taken, the decision maker receives a reward
MISC	for such situations the prediction problem can be formalized as a repeated game between the decision maker and the environment
MISC	this formulation goes back to the 1950's when hannan~ citation  and blackwell~ citation  showed that the decision maker has a randomized strategy that guarantees,  regardless of the outcome sequence, an average asymptotic reward as high as the maximal reward one could get by knowing the empirical distribution of the outcome sequence in advance
MISC	such strategies are called  hannan consistent
OWNX	to prove this result, hannan and blackwell assumed that the decision maker has full access to the past outcomes
OWNX	this case is termed the  full information  or the  perfect monitoring  case
MISC	however, in many important applications, the decision maker has limited information about the past elements of the sequence to be predicted
MISC	various models of limited feedback have been considered in the literature
MISC	perhaps the best known of them is the so-called  multi-armed bandit problem  in which the forecaster is only informed of its own reward but not the actual outcome; see ba\~nos~ citation , megiddo~ citation , foster and vohra~ citation , auer, cesa-bianchi, freund, and schapire~ citation , hart and mas colell~ citation
MISC	for example, it is shown in  citation  that hannan consistency is achievable in this case as well
MISC	the vocabulary of different sub-communities differ
MISC	ours is perhaps closest to that used by learning theorists
MISC	it is well understood under what conditions hannan consistency is achievable in this setup, see piccolboni and schindelhauer  citation  and cesa-bianchi, lugosi, and stoltz  citation
MISC	however, this condition is not always satisfied and then the natural question is what the best achievable performance for the decision maker is
MISC	this question was answered by rustichini  citation  who characterized the maximal achievable average reward that can be guaranteed asymptotically for all possible outcome sequences (in an almost sure sense)
MISC	a simplified efficient approachability-based strategy in the special case where the feedback is a function of the action of nature alone was shown in mannor and shimkin  citation
MISC	in the general case, the simplified approachability-based strategy of  citation  falls short of the maximal achievable average reward characterized by rustuchini  citation
OWNX	we introduce several forecasting strategies that exploit some specific properties of the problem at hand
OWNX	we design different prediction algorithms for all four cases
MISC	in the case of deterministic feedback signals these rates are optimal up to logarithmic factors
MISC	a motivating example for such a prediction problem arises naturally in multi-access channels that are prevalent in both wired and wireless networks
MISC	in such networks, the communication medium is shared between multiple decision makers
MISC	it is often technically difficult to synchronize between the decision makers
MISC	channel sharing protocols, and, in particular, several variants of spread spectrum, allow multiple agents to use the same channel (or channels that may interfere with each other) simultaneously
MISC	more specifically, consider a wireless system where multiple agents can choose in which channel to transmit data at any given time
MISC	the transmitting agent may choose which channel to use and how much power to spend on every transmission
MISC	the agent has a tradeoff between the amount of power wasted on transmission and the cost of having its message only partially received
MISC	instead, the transmitting agent can monitor the transmissions of the other agents
MISC	however, since the transmitting agent is physically far from the base-station and the other agents, the information about the channels chosen by other agents and the amount of power they used is imperfect
MISC	this naturally abstracts to an online learning problem with imperfect monitoring
OWNX	in the next section we formalize the prediction problem we investigate, introduce the  target quantity, that is, the best achievable reward, and the notion of regret
OWNX	in section  we describe some analytical properties of a key function  symbol , defined in section
OWNX	in section  we consider the simplest special case when the actions of the forecaster do not influence the feedback signal, which is, moreover, deterministic
OWNX	this case is basically as easy as the full information case and we obtain a regret bound of the order of  symbol  (with high probability) where  symbol  is the number of rounds of the prediction game
OWNX	in section  we study random feedback signals but still with the restriction that it is only determined by the outcome
OWNX	here we are able to obtain a regret of the order of  symbol
OWNX	the most general case is dealt with in section
MISC	the forecaster introduced there has a regret of the order of  symbol
OWNX	finally, in section  we show that this may be improved to  symbol  in the case of deterministic feedback signals, which is known to be optimal (see  citation )
MISC	this correspondence studies an estimator of the conditional  support of a distribution underlying a set of  iid 
MISC	the relation with mutual information is shown via an extension of  fano's theorem in combination with a generalization bound based on a compression argument
MISC	extensions to estimating the conditional quantile interval, and  statistical guarantees on the minimal convex hull are given {keywords}: -  statistical learning, fano's inequality, mutual information, support vector machines
MISC	copies of a random vector  symbol  possessing a fixed but unknown joint distribution  symbol ,  this letter concerns the question which values the random variable  symbol  can  possibly/likely take given a covariate  symbol
MISC	this investigation on predictive tolerance intervals  is motivated as one is often interested in other characteristics of the joint distribution than the conditional expectation (regression): eg in econometrics one is often more interested in the volatility of a market than in its precise prediction
MISC	in environmental sciences  one is typically concerned with the extremal behavior  (i e the min or max value) of a magnitude, and its respective conditioning  on related environmental variables
MISC	the main contribution of this letter is the extension to fano's classical inequality (see eg citation , p 38) which gives a lower-bound to the mutual information of two random variables
MISC	this classical result is extended towards a setting of learning theory where random variables have an arbitrary fixed distribution
OWNX	the derivation yields a non-parametric estimator of the mutual information possessing  a probabilistic guarantee which is derived using a classical compression argument
MISC	as an aside,  (i) an estimator of the conditional support is derived  and is extended to the setting of conditional quantiles,  (ii) its theoretical properties are derived,  (iii) the relation to the method of the minimal convex hull is made explicit, and (iv) it is shown how the estimate can be computed efficiently by  solving a linear program
MISC	a main conceptual difference with the existing literature on classical regression and  other predictor methods is that no attempt is made whatsoever to reveal an underlying  conditional mean (as in regression), conditional quantile (as in quantile regression), or minimal risk point prediction of the dependent variable (as in pattern recognition)
OWNX	here we target instead (the change of) the rough contour of the conditional distribution
OWNX	this implies that one becomes interested in  (i) to what extent the estimated conditional support of the tube is conservative  (i e does it overestimate the actual conditional support ), and  (ii) what is the probability of covering the actual conditional support (i e to what probability a new sample can occur outside the estimated interval) }   section ii proofs the main result, and explores the relation with the convex hull
OWNX	from a practical perspective, section iii provides further insight in  how the optimal estimate can be found efficiently by solving a linear program
MISC	this work is motivated by the necessity to automate the discovery of structure in vast and ever-growing collection of relational data commonly represented as graphs, for example genomic networks
OWNX	a novel algorithm, dubbed  graphitour , for structure induction by lossless graph compression is presented and illustrated by a clear and broadly known case of nested structure in a dna molecule
MISC	this work extends to graphs some well established approaches to grammatical inference previously applied only to strings
MISC	the bottom-up graph compression problem is related to the maximum cardinality (non-bipartite)  maximum cardinality matching problem
MISC	the algorithm accepts a variety of graph types including directed graphs and graphs with labeled nodes and arcs
MISC	the explosive growth of relational data, for example data about genes, drug molecules and proteins, their functions and interactions, necessitates efficient mathematical algorithms and software tools to extract meaningful generalizations
MISC	there is a large body of literature on the subject coming from a variety of disciplines from theoretical computer science to computational chemistry
MISC	however, one fundametal issue has so far remained unaddressed
OWNX	given a multi-level nested network of relations, such as a complex molecule, or a protein-protein interaction network, how can its structure be inferred from first principles
OWNX	the dna molecule is a double chain made of four kinds of nucleotides: a, t, g, c;   each of these is composed of two parts: one part---backbone---is identical among all the nucleotides (neglecting the difference between ribose and 2'-deoxyribose), another---heterocyclic base---is nucleotide-specific;  the backbone consists of sugar and phosphate;  the heterocyclic bases (c,t-pyrimidines; a,g-purines) all contain a pyrimidine ring;   the components can be further reduced to individual atoms and covalent bonds
MISC	this way of description is not unique, and may be altered according to the desired level of detail, but crucially, it is a hieararchical description of the whole as a structure built from identifiable and repetitive subcomponents
MISC	the picture of this beautiful multi-level hierarchy has emerged after years of bio-chemical discovery by scientists who gradually applied their natural abstraction and generalization abilities
OWNX	it is viewed as the result of a rule-driven generative process, which combines a finite set of undecomposable elements--- terminal symbols ---into novel complex objects--- non-terminal symbols , which can be combined in turn to produce the next level of description
MISC	the rules and symbols on which the process operates are determined by a  grammar  and the process itself is termed a  grammatical derivation
OWNX	in the case of the dna molecule above, the chemical elements correspond to terminal symbols
MISC	they are assembled into non-terminal symbols, i e compounds, according to some set of production rules defined by chemical properties
MISC	now, imagine receiving an alternative description of the same object, stripped off of any domain knowledge and context, simply as an enormous list of objects and binary relations on objects, corresponding to thousands of atoms and covalent bonds
MISC	such a list would remain completely incomprehensible to a human mind, along with any repetitive hierarchical structure present in it
MISC	discovering a hierarchy of nested elements without any prior knowledge of a kind, size and frequency of these constitutes a formidable challenge
OWNX	our goal is to be able to approach such  tasks in an automated fashion
MISC	let us imagine for a moment that the human researcher is not smart enough to comprehend a 6-node graph and find an explanatory layout
OWNX	thus, we would want to automatically translate such a graph into the graph grammar on the right
OWNX	the first expands a starting representation---a degenerate graph of a single node "s"---into a graph connecting two nodes of the same type "s1"
MISC	rozenberg~ citation  for extensive overview
MISC	it suffices to say that this field is mostly concerned with the transformation of the graphs, or parsing, i e explaining away a graph according to some known graph grammar, rather than with inducing such grammar from raw data
MISC	the closest work related to the ideas presented here is due to d
MISC	cook, l
MISC	holder and their colleagues (e g see~ citation  and several follow-up papers)
MISC	their work however is not concerned with inducing a structure from given graph data
MISC	rather, they induce a flat, context-free grammar, possibly with recursion, which is not only capable of, but is also bound to, generate objects not included in the original data
MISC	thus, their approach defies the relation to compression exploited here
MISC	another remotely similar work is by stolke~ citation  in application to inducing hidden markov models
MISC	there are many other works attempting to induce structure from relational data or compress graphs, but none seem to relate closely to the method considered here
OWNX	our method builds on the parallels between understanding and compression
MISC	this work extends to graphs some well established approaches to grammatical inference previously applied only to strings
MISC	two methods particularly worth mentioning in this context for grammar induction on sequences are  sequitour ~ citation  and {adios}~ citation
OWNX	we also take inspiration from a wealth  of sequence compression algorithms, often unknowingly run daily by all computer users in a form of archival software like  pkzip  in unix  or  expand  for mac os x
MISC	let us briefly convey the intuition behind such algorithms, many of which are surveyed by lehman and shelat~ citation
MISC	first, one has to remember that all such compression/discovery algorithms are bound to be heuristics, since finding the best compression is related to the so-called kolmogorov complexity and is provably hard~ citation
MISC	in some cases, a greedy strategy is used (see eg apostolico \& lonardi~ citation ), i e the substitution which will maximally reduce the size of the encoding at the current step is picked; in other cases, a simple first-come-first-served principle is used and any repetition is immediately eliminated (see eg nevill-manning \& witten~ citation )
MISC	extending these methods to a graph structure turns out to be non-trivial for several reasons
MISC	first, maintaining a lexicon of strings and looking up entries is quite different for graphs
MISC	second, directly extending the greedy approach~ citation  fails due to inherent non-linear entity interactions in a graph
MISC	reinforcement learning means learning a policy---a mapping of observations into actions---based on feedback from the environment
OWNX	we present an application of gradient ascent algorithm for reinforcement learning to a complex domain of packet routing in network communication and compare the performance of this algorithm to other routing methods on a benchmark problem
MISC	successful telecommunication requires efficient resource allocation that can be achieved by developing adaptive control policies
MISC	reinforcement learning ({rl})~ citation  presents a natural framework for the development of such policies by trial and error in the process of interaction with the environment
OWNX	in this work we apply the {rl} algorithm to network routing
MISC	it can be modeled as a multi-agent {rl} problem
MISC	in a sense, learning the optimal control for network routing could be thought of as learning in some traditional for {rl} episodic task, like maze searching or pole balancing, but repeating trials many times in parallel with interaction among trials
MISC	under this interpretation, an individual router is an agent which makes its routing decisions according to an individual policy
MISC	the parameters of this policy are adjusted according to some measure of the global performance of the network, while control is determined by local observations
MISC	nodes do not have any information regarding the topology of network or their position in it
MISC	the initialization of each node, as well as the learning algorithm it follows, are identical to that of every other node and independent of the structure of the network
MISC	there is no notion of orientation in space or other semantics of actions
MISC	the only global information required by the learning algorithm is the network utility expressed as a reward signal distributed once in an epoch and dependent on the average routing time
OWNX	this learning multi-agent system is biologically plausible and could be thought of as neural network in which each neuron only performs simple computations based on locally available quantities~ citation
MISC	in a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subject to:  the signal-to-noise ratio~(snr) is usually a main factor in determining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link
MISC	these probabilities are then a proxy for  the snr under which the links operate
OWNX	we show by an extensive numerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence speed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of a non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost
MISC	average consensus is a distributed algorithm that has been considered by tsitsiklis in his phd thesis,  citation , see also~ citation ,  found application recently in several areas, and is the subject of active research, e
MISC	g,,  citation
MISC	this topology design for sensor networks  has not received much attention in the literature
MISC	references~ citation  and~ citation  consider  restrict it to classes of random graphs,  in particular, small-world topologies
MISC	other recent work on evolving topologies includes~ citation  that considers continuous time consensus in networks with switching topologies and communication delays, and~ citation  that studies distributed consensus when the network is  a complete graph with identical link failure probabilities on all links
OWNX	section~ summarizes spectral graph theory concepts like  the graph laplacian~ symbol  and the graph algebraic connectivity   symbol
MISC	% of the  laplacian~ symbol
OWNX	the section formulates the problem of distributed average consensus with random link failures
OWNX	section~ presents bounds on the mss convergence rate
MISC	we show that these designs can improve significantly the convergence rate, for example, by a factor of~ symbol , when compared to geometric networks (networks where sensors communicate with every other sensor within a fixed radius) and that they can achieve practically the (asymptotic) performance of a nonrandom network at a fraction, eg , 50~\%, of the communication cost per iteration
MISC	the on-line shortest path problem is considered under various models of partial monitoring
MISC	given a weighted directed acyclic graph whose edge weights can change in an arbitrary (adversarial) way, a decision maker has to choose in each round of a game a path between two distinguished vertices such that the loss of the chosen path (defined as the sum of the weights of its composing edges) be as small as possible
MISC	in a setting generalizing the multi-armed bandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only the weights of those edges that belong to the chosen path
MISC	for this problem, an algorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in  symbol  rounds exceeds that of the best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, by a quantity that is proportional to  symbol  and depends only polynomially on the number of edges of the graph
MISC	an extension to the so-called label efficient setting is also given, in which the decision maker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosen path at a total of  symbol  time instances
MISC	another extension is shown where the decision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of the problem of tracking the best expert
MISC	a version of the multi-armed bandit setting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learns only the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individual edges on the path
MISC	applications to routing in packet switched networks along with simulation results are also presented
MISC	in a sequential decision problem, a decision maker (or forecaster) performs a sequence of actions
MISC	after each action the decision maker suffers some loss, depending on the response (or state) of the environment, and its goal is to minimize its cumulative loss over a certain period of time
MISC	in particular, the losses may depend on the previous actions of the decision maker, whose goal is to perform well relative to a set of reference forecasters (the so-called ``experts'') for any possible behavior of the environment
MISC	more precisely, the aim of the decision maker is to achieve asymptotically the same average (per round) loss as the best expert
MISC	research into this problem started in the 1950s (see, for example,  blackwell  citation  and hannan  citation  for some of the basic results) and gained new life in the 1990s following the work of vovk  citation , littlestone and warmuth  citation , and cesa-bianchi  et al symbol    citation
MISC	these results show that for any bounded loss function, if the decision maker has access to the past losses of all experts, then it is possible to construct on-line algorithms that perform, for any possible behavior of the environment, almost as well as the best of  symbol  experts
MISC	more precisely, the per round cumulative loss of these algorithms is at most as large as that of the best expert plus a quantity proportional to  symbol  for any bounded loss function, where  symbol  is the number of rounds in the decision game
MISC	the logarithmic dependence on the number of experts makes it possible to obtain meaningful bounds even if the pool of experts is very large
MISC	in certain situations the decision maker has only limited knowledge about the losses of all possible actions
MISC	for example, it is often natural to assume that the decision maker gets to know only the loss corresponding to the action it has made, and has no information about the loss it would have suffered had it made a different decision
MISC	this setup is referred to as the  multi-armed bandit problem , and was considered, in the adversarial setting, by auer  et al symbol     citation  who gave an algorithm whose normalized regret (the difference of the algorithm's average loss  and that of the best expert) is upper bounded by a quantity  which is  proportional to  symbol
MISC	another interesting example for the limited information case is the so-called  label efficient decision problem  (see helmbold and panizza  citation ) in which it is too costly to observe the state of the environment, and so the decision maker can query the losses of all possible actions for only a limited number of times
MISC	a recent result of cesa-bianchi, lugosi, and stoltz  citation  shows that in this case, if the decision maker can query the losses  symbol  times during a period of length  symbol , then it can achieve  symbol  average excess loss relative to the best expert
MISC	in many applications the set of experts has a certain structure that may be exploited to construct efficient on-line decision algorithms
MISC	the construction of such algorithms has been of great interest in computational learning theory
MISC	a partial list of works dealing with this problem includes herbster and warmuth~ citation , vovk~ citation , bousquet and warmuth~ citation , helmbold and schapire~ citation , takimoto and warmuth~ citation ,  kalai and vempala~ citation , gy\"orgy  at al symbol  ~ citation
MISC	in this problem, a weighted directed (acyclic) graph is given whose edge weights can change in an arbitrary manner, and the decision maker has to pick in each round a path between two given vertices, such that the weight of this path (the sum of the weights of its composing edges) be as small as possible
MISC	in the bandit setting only the weights of the edges or just the sum of the weights of the edges composing the chosen path are revealed to the decision maker
MISC	if one applies the general bandit algorithm of auer  et al  \  citation , the resulting bound will be too large to be of practical use because of its square-root-type dependence on the number  of paths  symbol
MISC	on the other hand, using the special graph structure in the problem, awerbuch and kleinberg  citation  and mcmahan and blum  citation  managed to get rid of the exponential dependence on the number of edges in the performance bound
MISC	they achieved this by extending the exponentially weighted average predictor and the  follow-the-perturbed-leader algorithm of hannan  citation  to the generalization of the multi-armed bandit setting for shortest paths, when only the sum of the weights of the edges is available for the algorithm
MISC	however, the dependence of the bounds obtained in  citation  and  citation  on the number of rounds  symbol  is significantly worse than the  symbol  bound of auer  et al  \  citation
MISC	awerbuch and kleinberg  citation  consider the model of ``non-oblivious'' adversaries for shortest path (i e , the losses assigned to the edges can depend on the previous actions of the forecaster) and prove an  symbol  bound for the expected per-round regret
OWNX	we achieve this bound in a model which assumes that the losses of all edges on the path chosen by the forecaster are available separately after making the decision
OWNX	we exhibit a simple algorithm which achieves an  symbol  per-round regret  with high probability  against ``non-oblivious'' adversary
MISC	in this case it remains an open problem to find an algorithm whose cumulative loss is polynomial in the number of edges of the graph and decreases as  symbol  with the number of rounds
OWNX	in section~ we formally  define the on-line shortest path problem, which is extended to the multi-armed bandit setting in section~
OWNX	another extension, when the algorithm competes against a time-varying path is studied in section
OWNX	simulation results are presented in section~
OWNX	our approach is a generalization of the perceptron method for ordinal regression
OWNX	on several benchmark datasets, our method (nnrank) outperforms a  neural network classification method
MISC	moreover, nnrank has the advantages of traditional neural networks: learning in both online and batch modes, handling very large training datasets, and making rapid predictions
MISC	the learning task of ordinal regression is to assign data points into a set of finite ordered categories
MISC	for example, a  teacher rates students' performance using a, b, c, d, and e  (a  symbol  b  symbol  c  symbol  d  symbol  e) (chu \& ghahramani, 2005a)
MISC	in contrast to metric regression, the response variables (categories) in  ordinal regression is discrete and finite
MISC	the research of ordinal regression dated back to the ordinal statistics methods in 1980s (mccullagh, 1980; mccullagh \& nelder, 1983) and  machine learning research in 1990s (caruana et al , 1996; herbrich et al , 1998; cohen et al , 1999)
MISC	it has attracted the considerable attention in recent years due to its potential applications in many data-intensive domains such as information retrieval (herbrich et al , 1998), web page ranking (joachims, 2002), collaborative filtering (goldberg et al , 1992; basilico \& hofmann, 2004; yu et al , 2006),  image retrieval (wu et al , 2003), and protein ranking (cheng \& baldi, 2006) in  bioinformatics
MISC	most of these methods can be roughly classified into two categories:  pairwise constraint approach (herbrich et al , 2000; joachims, 2002; dekel et al , 2004; burges et al , 2005) and  multi-threshold approach (crammer \& singer, 2002; shashua \& levin, 2003; chu \& ghahramani, 2005a)
OWNX	the former is to convert the full ranking relation into pairwise order constraints
MISC	the latter  tries to learn multiple thresholds to divide data into ordinal categories
MISC	prank (crammer \& singer, 2002), a perceptron approach that generalizes the binary perceptron algorithm to the ordinal multi-class situation,  is a fast online algorithm
MISC	one class of accurate large-margin classifier approaches (herbrich et al , 2000; joachims, 2002) convert the ordinal relations into  symbol  ( symbol : the number of data points)  pairwise ranking constraints for the structural  risk minimization (vapnik, 1995; schoelkopf \& smola, 2002)
MISC	thus, it can not be applied to medium size datasets  ( symbol  10,000 data points), without discarding some pairwise preference relations
MISC	it may also overfit noise due to incomparable pairs
MISC	the other class of powerful large-margin classifier  methods (shashua \& levin, 2003; chu \& keerthi, 2005) generalize the support vector formulation for ordinal regression by finding  symbol  thresholds on the real line that divide   data into  symbol  ordered categories
MISC	the size of this optimization problem is linear in the number of training examples
MISC	similarly, another state-of-the-art approach, gaussian process method (chu \& ghahramani, 2005a),   also has the difficulty of handling large training datasets  and the problem of slow prediction speed in some situations
OWNX	our method can  be considered a generalization of the perceptron     learning (crammer \& singer, 2002) into multi-layer perceptrons (neural network) for ordinal regression
OWNX	our method is also related to the classic generalized linear models (e g , cumulative logit model) for ordinal regression (mccullagh, 1980)
OWNX	thus, our method falls into the category of multi-threshold approach
OWNX	on the same benchmark datasets, our method yields the performance better than the standard classification  neural networks and comparable to the state-of-the-art methods using support vector machines and  gaussian processes
OWNX	in addition, our method can learn on very large datasets and make rapid predictions
MISC	a rational stochastic language is a probability distribution over a free monoid  symbol  which is rational over  symbol , that is which can be generated by a multiplicity automata with parameters in  symbol
OWNX	we study the relations between the classes of rational stochastic languages  symbol
OWNX	we define the notion of  residual  of a stochastic language and we use it to investigate properties of several subclasses of rational stochastic languages
OWNX	lastly, we study the representation of rational stochastic languages by means of multiplicity automata
MISC	these words are assumed to be independently drawn according to a fixed but unknown probability distribution over  symbol
MISC	probability distributions over free monoids  symbol  are called  stochastic languages
OWNX	a probabilistic automaton (pa) is composed of a  structure , which is a finite automaton (nfa), and  parameters  associated with states and transitions, which represent the probability for a state to be initial, terminal or the probability for a transition to be chosen
OWNX	given the structure  symbol  of a probabilistic automaton and a sequence of words  symbol , computing parameters for  symbol  which maximize the likelihood of  symbol  is np-hard  citation
MISC	in practical cases however, algorithms based on the e m ( expectation-maximization ) method  citation  can be used to compute approximate values
MISC	therefore, stochastic languages which can be generated by multiplicity automata are special cases of  rational languages
OWNX	we call them  rational stochastic languages
OWNX	does allowing negative coefficients in probabilistic automata extend the class of generated stochastic languages
MISC	can a rational stochastic language which takes all its values in  symbol  always be generated by a multiplicity automata with coefficients in  symbol
MISC	and so forth
MISC	also, studying  rational stochastic languages  for themselves, considered as objects of language theory, helps to bring out notions and properties which are important in a grammatical inference pespective: for example, we show that the notion of residual language (or derivative), so important for grammatical inference~ citation , has a natural counterpart for stochastic languages~ citation , which can be used to express many properties of classes of stochastic languages
MISC	formal power series  take their values in a semiring  symbol : let us denote by  symbol  the set of all formal power series
OWNX	here, we only consider semirings  symbol ,  symbol ,  symbol  and  symbol
OWNX	for any such semiring  symbol , we define the set  symbol  of rational stochastic languages as the set of stochastic languages over  symbol  which are rational languages over  symbol
OWNX	we show that  symbol  is a fatou extension of  symbol  for stochastic languages, which means that any rational stochastic language over  symbol  which takes its values in  symbol  is also rational over  symbol
MISC	however,  symbol  is not a fatou extension of  symbol  for stochastic languages: there exists a rational stochastic language over  symbol  which takes its values in  symbol  and which is not rational over  symbol
MISC	for any stochastic language  symbol  over  symbol  and any word  symbol  such that  symbol , let us define the residual language  symbol  of  symbol  with respect to  symbol  by  symbol : residual languages clearly are stochastic languages
OWNX	we show that the residual languages of a rational stochastic language  symbol  over  symbol  are also rational over  symbol
MISC	the residual subsemimodule  symbol  of  symbol  spanned by the residual languages of any stochastic language  symbol  may be used to express the rationality of  symbol :  symbol  is rational iff  symbol  is included in a finitely generated subsemimodule of  symbol
MISC	but when  symbol  is positive, i e symbol  or  symbol , it may happen that  symbol  itself is not finitely generated
OWNX	we study the properties of two subclasses of  symbol : the set  symbol  composed of rational stochastic languages over  symbol  whose residual subsemimodule is finitely generated and the set  symbol  composed of rational stochastic languages over  symbol  which have finitely many residual languages
OWNX	we show that for any of these two classes,  symbol  is a fatou extension of  symbol : any stochastic language of  symbol  (resp
MISC	of  symbol ) which takes its values in  symbol  is an element of  symbol  (resp
MISC	of  symbol )
OWNX	we also show that for any element  symbol  of  symbol , there exists a unique minimal subset of residual languages of  symbol  which generates  symbol
OWNX	then, we study the representation of rational stochastic languages by means of multiplicity automata
OWNX	we first show that the set of multiplicity automata with parameters in  symbol  which generate stochastic languages is not recursive
MISC	a stochastic language  symbol  is a formal series which has two properties: (i)  symbol  for any word  symbol , (ii)  symbol
OWNX	we show that the set of stochastic languages which can be generated by probabilistic automata with parameters in  symbol  (resp
MISC	symbol ) exactly coincides with  symbol  (resp
MISC	symbol )
OWNX	a probabilistic automaton  symbol  is called a probabilistic residual automaton (pra) if the stochastic languages associated with its states are residual languages of the stochastic languages  symbol  generated by  symbol
OWNX	we show that the set of stochastic languages that can be generated by probabilistic residual automata with parameters in  symbol  (resp
MISC	symbol ) exactly coincides with  symbol  (resp
MISC	symbol )
OWNX	we do not know whether the class of pra is decidable
OWNX	however, we describe two decidable subclasses of pra capable of generating  symbol  when  symbol  or  symbol : the class of  symbol -reduced pra and the class of prefixial pra
OWNX	the first one provides minimal representation in the class of pra but we show that the membership problem is pspace-complete
MISC	the second one produces more cumbersome representation but the membership problem is polynomial
OWNX	finally, we show that the set of stochastic languages that can be generated by probabilistic deterministic automata with parameters in  symbol  (resp
OWNX	we recall some properties on rational series, stochastic languages and multiplicity automata in section~
OWNX	we define and study rational stochastic languages in section~
MISC	properties of the residual languages of rational stochastic languages are studied in subsection~
MISC	classes  symbol  and  symbol  are defined and studied in subsection~
OWNX	the representation of rational stochastic languages by means of multiplicity automata is given in section~
OWNX	we make four contributions
OWNX	first, we prove that mco is mathematically identical to a broad class of pl problems
OWNX	second, we introduce immediate sampling, a new version of the probability collectives (pc) algorithm for blackbox optimization
MISC	immediate sampling transforms the original bo problem into an mco problem
OWNX	accordingly, by combining these first two contributions, we can apply all pl techniques to bo
MISC	finally, conventional mc and mco procedures ignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated values of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations are considered
MISC	this provides an additional way to apply pl techniques to improve mco
OWNX	we make four primary contributions
OWNX	first, we establish a mathematical identity equating mco with pl
OWNX	our second contribution is the introduction of immediate sampling
MISC	this is a new version of the probability collectives (pc) approach to blackbox optimization
MISC	however pc is broader and more fully motivated
MISC	in the immediate sampling version of pc the original bo problem is transformed into an mco problem
OWNX	in light of our first contribution, this means we can apply pl to immediate sampling
MISC	in this way  symbol  pl techniques --- including cross-validation, bagging, boosting, active learning, stacking, and others --- can be applied to blackbox optimization
OWNX	in our third contribution we experimentally explore the power of this identity between mco and pl
MISC	this constitutes yet another way of applying pl to mco in general, and therefore to bo in particular
MISC	the problem of joint universal source coding and modeling, treated in the context of lossless codes by rissanen, was recently generalized to fixed-rate lossy coding of finitely parametrized continuous-alphabet  iid 
MISC	sources
OWNX	we extend these results to variable-rate lossy block coding  of stationary ergodic sources and show that, for bounded metric distortion measures, any finitely parametrized family of stationary sources satisfying suitable mixing, smoothness and vapnik--chervonenkis learnability conditions admits universal schemes for joint lossy source coding and identification
OWNX	we also give several explicit examples of parametric sources satisfying the regularity conditions
MISC	a universal source coding scheme is one that performs asymptotically optimally for all sources within a given class
OWNX	intuition suggests that a good universal coder should acquire a probabilistic model of the source from a sufficiently long data sequence and operate based on this model
MISC	for lossless codes, this intuition has been made rigorous by rissanen  citation : the data are encoded via a two-part code which comprises (1) a suitably quantized maximum-likelihood estimate of the source parameters, and (2) an encoding of the data with the code optimized for the acquired model
MISC	sources with bounded parameter spaces  citation
MISC	the code operates by coding each block with the code matched to the parameters estimated from the preceding block
MISC	assumption, which excludes such practically relevant model classes as autoregressive sources or markov and hidden markov processes
MISC	furthermore, the assumption of a bounded parameter space may not be always justified
OWNX	the key novel feature of our scheme is that, unlike most existing schemes for universal lossy coding, which rely on implicit identification of the active source, it learns an explicit probabilistic model
OWNX	moreover, our results clearly show that the ``price of universality" of a modeling-based compression scheme grows with the combinatorial richness of the underlying model class, as captured by the vc dimension sequence  symbol
OWNX	we introduce a framework for filtering features that employs the hilbert-schmidt independence criterion (hsic) as a measure of dependence between the features and the labels
MISC	the key idea is that good features should maximise such dependence
OWNX	we demonstrate the usefulness of our method on both artificial and real world datasets
MISC	in supervised learning problems, we are typically given  symbol  data points  symbol  and their labels  symbol
MISC	the task is to find a functional dependence between  symbol  and  symbol ,  symbol , subject to certain optimality conditions
MISC	the problem of supervised feature selection can be cast as a combinatorial optimisation problem
OWNX	we have a full set of features, denoted  symbol  (whose elements correspond to the dimensions of the data)
OWNX	we use these features to predict a particular outcome, for instance the presence of cancer: clearly, only a subset  symbol  of features will be relevant
OWNX	feature selection can then be formulated as\\[-0 5cm] \\[-0 5cm] where  symbol  computes the cardinality of a set and  symbol  upper bounds the number of selected features
MISC	therefore, good criteria should satisfy two conditions:\\[-0 5cm]  while many feature selection criteria have been explored, few take these two conditions explicitly into account
MISC	examples include the leave-one-out error bound of svm  citation  and the mutual information  citation
MISC	hsic uses kernels for measuring dependence and does not require density estimation
MISC	hsic also has good uniform convergence guarantees
OWNX	as we show in section~, hsic satisfies conditions  i  and  ii , required for  symbol  \paragraph{feature selection algorithm } finding a global optimum for \eq{eq:fs} is in general np-hard  citation
MISC	many algorithms transform \eq{eq:fs} into a continuous problem by introducing weights on the dimensions  citation
MISC	these methods perform well for linearly separable problems
MISC	greedy approaches -- forward selection and backward elimination -- are often used to tackle problem () directly
MISC	although forward selection is computationally more efficient, backward elimination provides better features in general since the features are assessed within the context of all others \paragraph{bahsic } in principle, hsic can be employed using either the forwards or backwards strategy, or a mix of strategies
OWNX	our experiments show that backward elimination outperforms forward selection for hsic
MISC	it selects features independent of a particular classifier
MISC	such decoupling not only facilitates subsequent feature interpretation but also speeds up the computation over wrapper and embedded methods
MISC	most other feature selection methods are only formulated either for binary classification or regression
MISC	the multi-class extension of these methods is usually accomplished using a one-versus-the-rest strategy
MISC	still fewer methods handle classification and regression cases at the same time
MISC	bahsic, on the other hand, accommodates all these cases in a principled way: by choosing different kernels, bahsic also subsumes many existing methods as special cases
MISC	the versatility of bahsic originates from the generality of hsic
OWNX	therefore, we begin our exposition with an introduction of hsic
MISC	while it has been successfully employed in a wide variety of applications, there are relatively few theoretical guarantees of convergence and correctness for general loopy graphs that may have many short cycles
MISC	of these, even fewer provide exact ``necessary and sufficient'' characterizations
MISC	this is done by first constructing a probability distribution whose mode corresponds to the optimal matching, and then running max-product
MISC	weighted matching can also be posed as an integer program, for which there is an lp relaxation
MISC	this relaxation is not always tight
MISC	if the lp relaxation is loose, then max-product does not converge
OWNX	also, since lp relaxation is known to be tight for bipartite graphs, our results generalize other recent results on using max-product to find weighted matchings in bipartite graphs
MISC	message-passing algorithms, like belief propagation and its variants and generalizations, have been shown empirically to be very effective in solving many instances of hard/computationally intensive problems in a wide range of fields
MISC	in this case however, there are no guarantees of either convergence or correctness in general
MISC	citation  show correctness for graphs with at most one cycle
MISC	citation  show asymptotic correctness for random graphs associated with decoding
MISC	citation  shows that if max-product converges, then it is optimal in a relatively large ``local'' neighborhood
MISC	this problem can be formulated as an integer program, which has a natural lp relaxation
MISC	if the lp relaxation is loose, then max-product does not converge
MISC	bayati, shah and sharma  citation  were the first to investigate max-product for the weighted matching problem
MISC	recently, this result has been extended to  symbol -matchings on bipartite graphs  citation
OWNX	since the lp relaxation is always tight for bipartite graphs, the first part of our results recover their results and can be viewed as the correct generalization to arbitrary graphs, since in this case the tightness is a function of structure as well as weights
OWNX	we would like to point out three features of our work:   it provides a  necessary and sufficient  condition for convergnce of max-product in arbitrary problem instances
MISC	there are very few non-trivial classes of problems for which there is such a tight characterization of message-passing performance
MISC	the characterization is  data dependent : it is decided based not only on the graph structure but also on the weights of the particular instance
MISC	relations, similarities and comparisons between max-product and linear programming have been used/mentioned by several authors  citation , and an exact characterization of this relationship in general remains an interesting endeavor
OWNX	we consider the problem of minimal correction of the training set to make it consistent with monotonic constraints
MISC	this problem arises during analysis of data sets via techniques that require monotone data
OWNX	we show that this problem is np-hard in general and is equivalent to finding a maximal independent set in special orgraphs
MISC	practically important cases of that problem considered in detail
MISC	these are the cases when a partial order given on the replies set is a total order or has a dimension 2
OWNX	we show that the second case can be reduced to maximization of a quadratic convex function on a convex set
MISC	keywords: machine learning, supervised learning, monotonic constraints
MISC	requirements to a classifying rule in supervised learning problems consist of two parts
MISC	the first part is induced by a set of precedents, called the training set
MISC	each element in the training set is a pair of "object--reply" type
MISC	a classifying rule which is a mapping from objects set to the replies set should map objects from the training set pairs to the consistent replies
MISC	let us see what that problem is
MISC	for any given mapping  symbol  where  symbol  we pose a problem of finding a function  symbol  which is monotone due to partial orders  symbol  and minimizes the following functional:  symbol
MISC	let us denote the set of monotonic functions from  symbol  to  symbol  by  symbol
OWNX	then for a given mapping  symbol  our task is the following:  symbol   every mapping  symbol  which is monotone on the subset  symbol  can be extended to the mapping monotone on the whole set  symbol  because  symbol  is a lattice
MISC	actually on every finite subset of the lattice  symbol  the operation  symbol  is defined and the function  symbol  is both monotone and satisfies  symbol
OWNX	from this we see that in the posed problem we can imply that  symbol
OWNX	from the above said we conclude more that this problem is equivalent to finding a maximal subset  symbol  such that the function  symbol  restricted on the subset  symbol  is monotone
MISC	then every element  symbol  is assigned by a positive integer weight  symbol
OWNX	our task is to find a maximal by weight subset  symbol  such that the function  symbol  restricted on  symbol  is monotone i e symbol {definition 1 } the set  symbol  is called acceptable iff the function  symbol  restricted on  symbol  is monotone {definition 2 } a set which  is acceptable and maximal by weight is denoted by  symbol (in some cases we use this notation to mean the weight of this set)
MISC	observations consisting of measurements on relationships for pairs of objects arise in many settings, such as protein interaction and gene regulatory networks, collections of author-recipient email, and social networks
MISC	analyzing such data with probabilisic models can be delicate because the simple exchangeability assumptions underlying many boilerplate models no longer hold
AIMX	in this paper, we describe a latent variable model of such data called the  mixed membership stochastic blockmodel
OWNX	we develop a general variational inference algorithm for fast approximate posterior inference
MISC	keywords:   hierarchical bayes, latent variables, mean-field approximation, statistical network analysis, social networks, protein interaction networks
MISC	modeling relational information among objects, such as pairwise relations represented as graphs, is becoming an important problem in modern data analysis and machine learning
OWNX	many data sets contain interrelated observations
OWNX	in these settings, we often wish to infer hidden attributes of the objects from the observed measurements on pairwise properties
MISC	one problem that has been heavily studied is that of  clustering  the objects to uncover a group structure based on the observed patterns of interactions
MISC	the latent stochastic blockmodel~ citation  represents an adaptation of mixture modeling to dyadic data
MISC	in that model, each object belongs to a cluster and the relationships between objects are governed by the corresponding pair of clusters
MISC	via posterior inference on such a model one can identify latent roles that objects possibly play, which govern their relationships with each other
MISC	this model originates from the stochastic blockmodel, where the roles of objects are known in advance~ citation
MISC	the latent stochastic blockmodel suffers from a limitation that each object can only belong to one cluster, or in other words, play a single latent role
MISC	in real life, it is not uncommon to encounter more intriguing data on entities that are multi-facet
MISC	for example, when a protein or a social actor interacts with different partners, different functional or social contexts may apply and thus the protein or the actor may be acting according to different latent roles they can possible play
MISC	mixed membership models, such as latent dirichlet allocation~ citation , have emerged in recent years as a flexible modeling tool for data where the single cluster assumption is violated by the heterogeneity within of a data point
MISC	they have been successfully applied in many domains, such as document analysis~ citation , surveys~ citation , image processing~ citation , transcriptional regulation  citation , and population genetics~ citation
MISC	the mixed membership formalism is a particularly natural idea for relational data, where the objects can bear multiple latent roles or cluster-memberships that influence their relationships to others
OWNX	as we will demonstrate, a mixed membership approach to relational data lets us describe the interaction between objects playing multiple roles
MISC	for example, some of a protein's interactions may be governed by one function; other interactions may be governed by another function
MISC	existing mixed membership models are not appropriate for relational data because they assume that the data are conditionally independent given their latent membership vectors
MISC	the conditional independence assumptions of modern mixed membership models do not apply
OWNX	our model captures the multiple roles that objects exhibit in interaction with others, and the relationships between those roles in determining the observed interaction matrix
OWNX	the application to a friendship network among students tests the model on a real data set where a well-defined latent block structure exists (section )
OWNX	the application to a protein interaction network tests to what extent our model can reduce the dimensionality of the data, while revealing substantive information about the functionality of proteins that can be used to inform subsequent analyses (section )
OWNX	in the process of training support vector machines~(svms) by decomposition methods, working set selection is an important technique, and some exciting schemes were employed into this field
OWNX	to improve working set selection, we propose a new model for working set selection in sequential minimal optimization~(smo) decomposition methods
MISC	in this model, it selects  symbol  as % symbol  as working set without reselection
OWNX	some properties are given by simple proof, and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is in general faster than existing methods
MISC	in the past few years, there has been huge of interest in support vector machines~(svms)~ citation  because they have excellent generalization performance on a wide range of problems
MISC	notable effects have been taken into training svms~ citation
MISC	in each iteration, the variable indices are split into a "working set":  symbol  and its complement  symbol
MISC	then, the sub-problem with variables  symbol , is solved, thereby, leaving the values of the remaining variables  symbol  unchanged
MISC	an extreme case is the sequential minimal optimization~(smo)~ citation , which restricts working set to have only two elements
MISC	comparative tests against other algorithms, done by platt~ citation , indicates that smo is often much faster and has better scaling properties
MISC	since only few components are updated per iteration, for difficult problems, the decomposition method suffers from slow convergence
MISC	better method of working set selection can reduce the number of iterations and hence is an important research issue
MISC	some methods were proposed to solve this problem and to reduce the time of training svms~ citation
MISC	in this model, specially, it selects  symbol  without reselection
OWNX	experiments demonstrate that the new model is in general faster than existing methods
OWNX	in section ii, we give literature review, smo decomposition method and existing working set selection are both discussed
OWNX	a new method of working set selection is then presented in section iii
OWNX	in section iv, experiments with corresponding analysis are given
MISC	conformal prediction uses past experience to determine precise levels of confidence in new predictions
MISC	conformal prediction is designed for an on-line setting in which labels are predicted successively, each one being revealed before the next is predicted
MISC	the most novel and valuable feature of conformal prediction is that if the successive examples are sampled  independently from the same distribution, then the successive predictions will be right  symbol  of the time, even though they are based on an accumulating dataset rather than on  independent datasets
MISC	in addition to the model under which successive examples are  sampled independently, other  on-line compression models can also use conformal prediction
MISC	this tutorial presents a self-contained account of the theory of  conformal prediction and works through several numerical examples
MISC	a more comprehensive treatment of the topic is provided in   algorithmic learning in a random world , by vladimir vovk, alex gammerman, and glenn shafer (springer, 2005)
MISC	how good is your prediction  symbol
MISC	if you are predicting the label  symbol  of a new object, how confident are you that  symbol
MISC	if the label  symbol  is a number, how close do you think it is to  symbol
MISC	in machine learning, these questions are usually answered in a fairly rough way  from past experience
OWNX	we expect new predictions to fare about as well as past predictions
MISC	conformal prediction uses past experience to determine precise  levels of confidence in  predictions
MISC	typically  symbol  also contains the prediction  symbol
OWNX	we call  symbol  the  point prediction , and we call  symbol  the  region prediction
MISC	in the case of  regression, where  symbol  is a number,  symbol  is typically an interval  around  symbol
MISC	in the case of classification, where  symbol  has  a limited number of possible values,  symbol  may consist of a few of these values or, in the ideal case, just one
MISC	conformal prediction can be used with any method of point prediction for classification or regression, including support-vector  machines, decision trees, boosting, neural networks, and bayesian prediction
MISC	given a nonconformity measure, the conformal algorithm produces a prediction region  symbol  for every probability of error  symbol
MISC	the region  symbol  is a  symbol - prediction  region ; it contains  symbol  with probability at least  symbol
OWNX	the regions for different  symbol  are nested:  when  symbol , so that   symbol  is a lower level of confidence than  symbol , we have  symbol
OWNX	as we explain in~\s, the conformal algorithm  is designed for an on-line setting, in which we predict the labels of objects  successively, seeing each label after we have  predicted it and before we predict the next one
OWNX	our  prediction  symbol  of the  symbol th label  symbol  may use observed features  symbol  of the  symbol th object and the preceding examples  symbol
MISC	the size of the prediction region  symbol  may also depend on these details
OWNX	as we explain in \s, the on-line picture leads to a new concept of validity for  prediction with confidence
MISC	classically, a method for finding  symbol  prediction regions was considered valid if it had a  symbol  probability of containing  the label predicted, because by the law of the large numbers it would then be correct  symbol  of the time when repeatedly applied to independent datasets
OWNX	but in the on-line picture, we repeatedly apply a method not to independent datasets but to an accumulating dataset
OWNX	after using  symbol  and  symbol  to predict  symbol , we use   symbol  and  symbol  to predict  symbol , and so on
MISC	one setting where conformal prediction is valid in the new on-line sense is the one in which the  examples  symbol  are sampled independently from a constant  population---i e , from a fixed but unknown probability  distribution  symbol
MISC	it is also valid under the slightly weaker assumption that the examples are probabilistically  exchangeable  (see \s) and under other on-line compression models, including the widely used gaussian linear model (see \s)
MISC	the validity of conformal prediction under these models is  demonstrated in appendix~
MISC	it is efficient if the prediction region is usually  relatively small and therefore informative
OWNX	in classification, we would like to see a 95\% prediction region  so small that it contains only the single predicted label  symbol
OWNX	in regression, we would like to see a very narrow interval around the predicted number  symbol
MISC	the claim of 95\% confidence for a 95\% conformal prediction region is valid under exchangeability, no matter what the probability distribution  symbol  the examples follow and no matter what nonconformity measure is used to construct the conformal prediction region
MISC	but the efficiency of conformal prediction  will depend on  symbol  and the nonconformity measure
OWNX	if we have prior probabilities for  symbol ,  we may use these prior probabilities to construct a point predictor  symbol  and a nonconformity measure
MISC	this strategy of first guaranteeing validity under a relatively weak assumption and then seeking efficiency under stronger assumptions conforms to advice long given by john tukey and others  citation
MISC	conformal prediction is studied in detail in  algorithmic learning in a random world , by vovk, gammerman, and shafer  citation
MISC	a recent exposition by gammerman and vovk  citation  emphasizes connections with the theory of randomness, bayesian methods, and induction
OWNX	in this article we emphasize  the on-line concept of validity, the meaning of exchangeability, and the generalization to other on-line compression models
MISC	bounds on the risk play a crucial role in statistical learning theory
OWNX	we introduce the generalizations appropriate for the missing case, the one of models with values in  symbol
MISC	this provides us with a new guaranteed risk for m-svms which appears superior to the existing one
MISC	however, the theory of bounds has primarily been developed for the computation of dichotomies only
MISC	central in this theory is the notion of ``capacity'' of classes of functions
MISC	extensions have also been proposed for real-valued bi-class models and multi-class models taking theirs values in the set of categories
MISC	a generalization of sauer's lemma  citation  is given,  which relates the covering numbers appearing in the standard guaranteed risk for large margin multi-category discriminant models to one of these dimensions, the margin natarajan dimension
OWNX	section~ introduces the basic bound on the risk of large margin multi-category discriminant models
OWNX	the upper bound on the margin natarajan dimension of the m-svms is then described in section~
MISC	they can be found in  citation
MISC	sparse pca seeks sparse factors, or linear combinations of the data variables, explaining a maximum amount of variance in the data while having only a limited number of nonzero coefficients
OWNX	we begin with a brief introduction and motivation on sparse pca and detail our implementation of the algorithm in d'aspremont et al (2005)
OWNX	we then apply these results to some classic clustering and feature selection problems arising in biology
MISC	sparse methods have had a significant impact in many areas of statistics, in particular regression and classification (see  citation ,  citation  and  citation  among others)
OWNX	as in these areas, our motivation for developing sparse multivariate visualization tools is the potential of these methods for yielding statistical results that are both more interpretable and more robust than classical analyses, while giving up little statistical efficiency
MISC	principal component analysis (pca) is a classic tool for analyzing large scale multivariate data
MISC	it seeks linear combinations of the data variables (often called factors or principal components) that capture a maximum amount of variance
MISC	numerically, pca only amounts to computing a few leading eigenvectors of the data's covariance matrix, so it can be applied to very large scale data sets
MISC	one of the key shortcomings of pca however is that these factors are linear combinations of  all  variables; that is, all factor coefficients (or loadings) are non-zero
MISC	this means that while pca facilitates model interpretation and visualization by concentrating the information in a few key factors, the factors themselves are still constructed using  all  observed variables
MISC	in many applications of pca, the coordinate axes have a direct physical interpretation; in finance or biology for example, each axis might correspond to a specific financial asset or gene
MISC	in such cases, having only a few nonzero coefficients in the principal components would greatly improve the relevance and interpretability of the factors
MISC	earlier methods to produce sparse factors include cadima and jolliffe  citation  where the loadings with smallest absolute value are thresholded to zero and nonconvex algorithms called scotlass by  citation , slra  citation  and spca by  citation
MISC	this last method works by writing pca as a regression-type optimization problem and applies lasso  citation , a penalization technique based on the  symbol  norm
MISC	very recently,  citation  and  citation  also proposed a greedy approach which seeks globally optimal solutions on small problems and uses a greedy method to approximate the solution of larger ones
OWNX	we then show on classic gene expression data sets that using sparse pca as a simple clustering tool isolates very relevant genes compared to other techniques such as recursive feature elimination or ranking
OWNX	in section , we begin with a brief introduction and motivation on sparse pca and detail our implementation of the algorithm in a numerical toolbox called dspca, which is available for download on the authors' websites
OWNX	in section , we describe the application of sparse pca to clustering and feature selection on gene expression data
OWNX	% we consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a gaussian or binary distribution in such a way that the resulting undirected graphical model is sparse
MISC	the problem as formulated is convex but the memory requirements and complexity of existing interior point methods are prohibitive for problems with more than tens of nodes
OWNX	we present two new algorithms for solving problems with at least a thousand nodes in the gaussian case
OWNX	our first algorithm uses block coordinate descent, and can be interpreted as recursive  symbol -norm penalized regression
OWNX	our second algorithm, based on nesterov's first order method, yields a complexity estimate with a better dependence on problem size than existing interior point methods
OWNX	using a log determinant relaxation of the log partition function ( citation ), we show that these same algorithms can be used to solve an approximate sparse maximum likelihood problem for the binary case
OWNX	we test our algorithms on synthetic data, as well as on gene expression and senate voting records data
MISC	% put the title of the first chapter on this line undirected graphical models offer a way to describe and explain the relationships among a set of variables, a central element of multivariate data analysis
AIMX	in this paper weconsider practical ways of implementing the following approach to finding such a model:  given a set of data, we solve a maximum likelihood problem with an added  symbol -norm penalty to make the resulting graph as sparse as possible
MISC	many authors have studied a variety of related ideas
MISC	however, this is computationally infeasible for data with even a moderate number of variables
MISC	another way to estimate the graphical model is to find the set of neighbors of each node in the graph by regressing that variable against the remaining variables
MISC	in this vein,  citation  employ a stochastic algorithm to manage tens of thousands of variables
MISC	there has also been a great deal of interest in using  symbol -norm penalties in statistical applications
MISC	citation  apply an  symbol  norm penalty to sparse principle component analysis
MISC	the difficulty lies in its computation
MISC	although the problem is convex, it is non-smooth and has an unbounded constraint set
MISC	the memory requirements and complexity are thus prohibitive for  symbol  higher than the tens
MISC	specialized algorithms are needed to handle larger problems
OWNX	we begin by considering gaussian data
OWNX	in section  we set up the problem, derive its dual, discuss properties of the solution and how heavily to weight the  symbol -norm penalty in our problem
OWNX	in section  we present a provably convergent block coordinate descent algorithm that can be interpreted as recursive  symbol -norm penalized regression
OWNX	in section  we present a second, alternative algorithm based on nesterov's recent work on non-smooth optimization, and give a rigorous complexity analysis with better dependence on problem size than interior point methods
OWNX	in section , we test our methods on synthetic as well as gene expression and senate voting records data
MISC	this is known as sparse principal component analysis and has a wide array of applications in machine learning and engineering
OWNX	we formulate a new semidefinite relaxation to this problem and derive a greedy algorithm that computes a  full set  of good solutions for all target numbers of non zero coefficients, with total complexity  symbol , where  symbol  is the number of variables
OWNX	we then use the same relaxation to derive sufficient conditions for global optimality of a solution, which can be tested in  symbol  per pattern
OWNX	we discuss applications in subset selection and sparse recovery and show on artificial examples and biological data that our algorithm does provide globally optimal solutions in many cases
MISC	principal component analysis (pca) is a classic tool for data analysis, visualization or compression and has a wide range of applications throughout science and engineering
OWNX	numerically, a full pca involves a singular value decomposition of the data matrix
MISC	one of the key shortcomings of pca is that the factors are linear combinations of  all  original variables; that is, most of factor coefficients (or loadings) are non-zero
MISC	this means that while pca facilitates model interpretation and visualization by concentrating the information in a few factors, the factors themselves are still constructed using all variables, hence are often hard to interpret
MISC	in many applications, the coordinate axes involved in the factors have a direct physical interpretation
MISC	in financial or  biological applications, each axis might correspond to a specific asset or gene
MISC	in problems such as these, it is natural to seek a trade-off between the two goals of  statistical fidelity  (explaining most of the variance in the data) and  interpretability  (making sure that the factors involve only a few coordinate axes)
MISC	solutions that have only a few nonzero coefficients in the principal components are usually easier to interpret
MISC	moreover, in some applications, nonzero coefficients have a direct cost (\eg, transaction costs in finance) hence there may be a direct trade-off between statistical fidelity and practicality
OWNX	our aim here is to efficiently derive  sparse principal components , i
OWNX	our belief is that in many applications, the decrease  in statistical fidelity required to obtain sparse factors is  small and relatively benign
MISC	while pca is numerically easy, each factor requires computing a leading eigenvector, which can be done in  symbol , sparse pca is a hard combinatorial problem
MISC	sometimes ad hoc ``rotation'' techniques are used to post-process the results from pca and find interpretable directions underlying a particular subspace (see  citation )
MISC	another simple solution is to  threshold  the loadings with small absolute value to zero  citation
MISC	with the exception of simple thresholding, all the algorithms above require solving non convex problems
MISC	recently also,  citation  derived an  symbol  based semidefinite relaxation for the sparse pca problem () with a complexity of  symbol  for a given  symbol
MISC	finally,  citation  used greedy search and branch-and-bound methods to solve small instances of problem () exactly and get good solutions for larger ones
OWNX	our contribution here is twofold
OWNX	we first derive a greedy algorithm for computing a  full set  of good solutions (one for each target sparsity between 1 and  symbol ) at a total numerical cost of  symbol  based on the convexity of the of the largest eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix
OWNX	we then derive  tractable  sufficient conditions for a vector  symbol  to be a  global  optimum of ()
MISC	this means in practice that, given a vector  symbol  with support  symbol , we can test if  symbol  is a globally optimal solution to problem () by performing a few binary search iterations to solve a one dimensional convex minimization problem
OWNX	in fact, we can take any sparsity pattern candidate from any algorithm and test its optimality
MISC	however, it was shown recently (see  citation ,  citation  or  citation  among others) that there is in fact a deep connection between  symbol  constrained extremal eigenvalues and lasso type variable selection algorithms
MISC	sufficient conditions based on sparse eigenvalues (also called restricted isometry constants in  citation ) guarantee consistent variable selection (in the lasso case) or sparse recovery (in the decoding problem)
OWNX	the results we derive here produce upper bounds on sparse extremal eigenvalues and can thus be used to prove consistency in lasso estimation, prove perfect recovery in sparse recovery problems, or prove that a particular solution of the subset selection problem is optimal
OWNX	of course, our conditions are only sufficient, not necessary (which would contradict the np-hardness of subset selection) and the duality bounds we produce on sparse extremal eigenvalues cannot always be tight, but we observe that the duality gap is often small
OWNX	we begin by formulating the sparse pca problem in section
OWNX	in section , we write an efficient algorithm for computing a full set of candidate solutions to problem () with total complexity  symbol
OWNX	in \mysec{semidefinite} we then formulate a convex relaxation for the sparse pca problem, which we use in section  to derive tractable sufficient conditions for the global optimality of a particular sparsity pattern
OWNX	in section  we detail applications to subset selection, sparse recovery and variable selection
OWNX	finally, in section , we test the numerical performance of these results
OWNX	we consider an agent interacting with an unmodeled environment
MISC	at each time, the agent makes an observation, takes an action, and incurs a cost
MISC	its actions can influence future observations and costs
MISC	the goal is to minimize the long-term average cost
OWNX	we propose a novel algorithm, known as the active lz algorithm, for optimal control based on ideas from the lempel-ziv scheme for universal data compression and prediction
OWNX	\ieeeparstart{c}{onsider} an agent that, at each integer time  symbol , makes an observation  symbol  from a finite observation space  symbol , and takes an action  symbol  selected from a finite action space  symbol
MISC	the agent incurs a bounded cost  symbol
OWNX	we will propose a general action-selection strategy called the  active lz algorithm
MISC	the main assumption is that there exists an integer  symbol  such that the future is conditionally independent of the past given a window of  symbol  consecutive actions and observations
MISC	in other words,  symbol } where  symbol  is a transition kernel and  symbol  is the  symbol -algebra generated by  symbol
MISC	that is, where there is a finite but unknown dependence on history
MISC	the optimization problem is to find a sequence of functions  symbol , where each function  symbol  specifies an encoder at time  symbol , so as to minimize the long-term average distortion  symbol  assume that the source is markov of order  symbol , but that both the transition probabilities for the source and the order  symbol  are unknown
OWNX	then, optimal coding problem at hand falls within our framework (cf
OWNX	the active lz algorithm we develop consists of two broad components
MISC	in particular, on the one hand, the algorithm must select actions in a manner that builds an accurate context tree
MISC	on the other hand, the desire to minimize costs naturally restricts this selection
OWNX	by carefully balancing these two tensions our algorithm achieves an average cost equal to that of an optimal policy with full knowledge of the kernel  symbol
MISC	related problems have been considered in the literature
OWNX	the algorithm there, however, seems difficult and unrealistic to implement in contrast with what we present here
MISC	further, it relies on knowledge of a constant related to the amount of time a `homing' policy requires to achieve equilibrium
MISC	this constant may be challenging to estimate
MISC	work by de farias and megiddo  citation  considers an optimal control framework where the dynamics of the environment are not known and one wishes to select the best of a finite set of `experts'
OWNX	in contrast, our problem can be thought of as competing with the set of all possible strategies
MISC	the prediction problem for loss functions with memory and a markov-modulated source considered by  merhav et al \  citation  is essentially a markov decision problem as the authors point out; again, in this case, knowing the structure of the loss function implicitly gives the order of the underlying markov process
MISC	the active lz algorithm is inspired by the lempel-ziv algorithm
MISC	this algorithm has been extended to address many problems, such as prediction  citation  and filtering  citation
MISC	this is in contrast to the active lz algorithm, which proactively anticipates the effect of actions on future observations
MISC	the lempel-ziv algorithm and its extensions revolve around a context tree data structure that is constructed as observations are made
MISC	this data structure is simple and elegant from an implementational point of view
MISC	such data structures have proved useful in representing experience in algorithms for engineering applications ranging from compression to prediction to denoising
OWNX	in section~, we formulate our problem precisely
OWNX	our main result, as stated in theorem~ in section~, is that the algorithm is asymptotically optimal
OWNX	section~ concludes
OWNX	we consider the least-square regression problem with regularization by a block  symbol -norm, ie , a sum of  euclidean norms over spaces of dimensions larger than one
OWNX	we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the consistency of group lasso under practical assumptions, such as model misspecification
MISC	when the linear predictors and  euclidean norms are replaced by functions and reproducing kernel hilbert norms, the problem is usually referred to as multiple kernel learning and is commonly used for learning from heterogeneous data sources and for non linear variable selection
OWNX	using tools from functional analysis, and in particular covariance operators,  we extend the consistency results to this infinite dimensional case and also propose an adaptive scheme to obtain a consistent model estimate, even when the necessary  condition required for the non adaptive scheme is not satisfied
MISC	in recent years, regularization by non hilbertian norms  has generated considerable interest in linear supervised learning, where the goal is to predict a response as a linear function of  covariates;  in particular, regularization by the  symbol -norm (equal to the sum of absolute values), a method commonly referred to as the  lasso ~ citation , allows to perform variable selection
MISC	in particular, in low correlation settings, the lasso is indeed consistent
MISC	however, in presence of strong correlations, the lasso cannot be consistent, shedding light on potential problems of such procedures for variable selection
MISC	adaptive versions where data-dependent weights are added to the  symbol -norm  then allow to keep the consistency in all situations~ citation
MISC	a related lasso-type procedure is the  group lasso , where the covariates are assumed to be clustered in groups, and instead of summing the absolute values of each individual loading, the sum of euclidean norms of the loadings in each group is used
MISC	intuitively, this should drive all the weights in one group to zero  together , and thus lead to group selection~ citation
OWNX	in \mysec{grouplasso}, we extend the consistency results of the lasso to the group lasso, showing that similar correlation conditions are necessary and sufficient conditions for consistency
AIMX	in the context of  misspecification , which is a common situation when applying methods such as the ones presented in this paper, we simply prove convergence to the best linear predictor (which is assumed to be sparse), both in terms of loading vectors and sparsity patterns
MISC	the group lasso essentially replaces groups of size one by groups of size larger than one
MISC	it is natural in this context to allow the size of each group to grow unbounded, i e , to replace the sum of euclidean norms by a sum  of appropriate hilbertian norms
MISC	this framework, referred to as  multiple kernel learning ~ citation , has applications in kernel selection, data fusion from heterogeneous data sources and non linear variable selection~ citation
OWNX	we extend  the consistency results of the group lasso to this non parametric  case, by using covariance operators and appropriate notions of functional analysis
MISC	these notions allow to carry out the analysis entirely in  ``primal/input''  space, while the algorithm has to work in  ``dual/feature''   space to avoid infinite dimensional optimization
OWNX	finally, we present the adaptive schemes in \mysec{adaptive} and illustrate our set of results with simulations on synthetic examples in \mysec{simulations}
OWNX	we show how rate-distortion theory provides a mechanism for automated theory building by naturally distinguishing between regularity and randomness
MISC	in this limit, the model's complexity is given by the statistical complexity, which is known to be minimal for achieving maximum prediction
MISC	progress in science is often driven by the discovery of novel patterns
MISC	historically, physics has relied on the creative mind of the theorist to  articulate mathematical models that capture nature's regularities in physical  principles and laws
MISC	but the last decade has witnessed a new era in collecting  truly vast data sets
MISC	examples include contemporary experiments in particle  physics  citation  and astronomy  citation , but range to genomics, automated language translation  citation , and web social organization  citation
MISC	in all these, the volume of data far exceeds  what any human can analyze directly by hand
MISC	a principled understanding of model making is critical to provide theoretical guidance for developing automated procedures
OWNX	in this letter, we show how basic  information-theoretic optimality criteria provide a method for automatically constructing a hierarchy of models that achieve different degrees of abstraction
OWNX	importantly, we show that in appropriate limits the method recovers a process's causal organization
MISC	without this connection, it would be only another approach to statistical inference, with its own ad hoc assumptions about the character of natural pattern
MISC	theory building, then, faces the challenge of extracting from that information the structures underling its generation
MISC	any physical theory delineates mechanism from  randomness by identifying what part of an observed phenomenon is due to  the underlying process's structure and what is irrelevant
MISC	irrelevant parts  are considered noise and typically modeled probabilistically
MISC	successful  theory building therefore depends centrally on deciding what is structure and what is noise; often, an implicit distinction
MISC	what constitutes a good theory, though
MISC	which information is relevant
MISC	one can answer this question for time series prediction: information about  the future of the time series is relevant
MISC	beyond forecasting, though, models are often put to the test by assessing how well they predict new data and, hence, it is of general importance that a model capture information which aids prediction
MISC	typically, there are many models that explain a given data set, and between two models that are equally predictive, one favors the simpler, smaller, less structurally complex model  citation
MISC	however, a more complex model can achieve smaller prediction error than a less complex model
MISC	the trade-off between model complexity and prediction error is tantamount to finding a distinction between causal structure and noise
MISC	the trade-off between assigning a causal mechanism to the occurrence of an event or explaining the event as being merely random has a long history, but  how one implements the trade-off is still a very active topic
MISC	nonlinear time series analysis  citation , to take one example, attempts to account for long-range correlations produced by nonlinear dynamical systems---correlations not adequately modeled by assumptions such as linearity and independent, identically distributed ( iid  ) data
MISC	success in this endeavor requires directly addressing the notion of structure and pattern  citation
MISC	examination of the essential goals of prediction led to a principled definition of structure that captures a dynamical system's causal organization in part by discovering the underlying  causal states   citation
MISC	in  computational mechanics  a process  symbol  is viewed as a communication channel  citation : it transmits information from the  past   symbol  to the  future   symbol  by storing it in the present
MISC	for the purpose of forecasting the future two different pasts, say  symbol  and  symbol , are equivalent if they result in the same prediction  citation
OWNX	in general this prediction is probabilistic, given by the conditional future distribution  symbol
MISC	this is related to the fact that the causal-state partition is optimally predictive
MISC	furthermore, note that, by definition, for  any  partition  symbol  of  symbol  with states  symbol , when the past is known, then the future distribution is not altered by the history-space partitioning:   symbol }  this implies for the causal states that  symbol  and thus  symbol
MISC	therefore, causal shielding is equivalent to the fact  citation  that the causal states capture  all  of the information  symbol  that is shared between past and future:  symbol ,  the process's  excess entropy   symbol  or  predictive information    citation
MISC	the causal states are  unique and minimal sufficient statistics  for time series prediction, capturing all of a process's predictive information at maximum efficiency  citation
MISC	the causal-state partition has the smallest  statistical complexity ,  symbol , compared to all other  equally predictive partitions  symbol
MISC	however, in a lot of applications of interest, acquisition of large amounts of observations is easy, while the process of generating labels is time-consuming or costly
OWNX	much of classical machine learning deals with the case where we wish to learn a target concept in the form of a function  symbol , when all we have is a finite set of examples  symbol
MISC	active learning algorithms (i e citation ) deal indirectly with this by selecting examples which are expected to increase accuracy the most
MISC	however, the basic question of whether new examples should be queried at all is seldom addressed
OWNX	we introduce a cost function that represents the trade-off between final performance (in terms of generalisation error) and querying costs (in terms of the number of labels queried)
MISC	firstly, as the basis for creating cost-dependent stopping rules
OWNX	while due to the nature of the problem there is potential for misspecification, we nevertheless show experimentally that the stopping times we obtain are close to the optimal stopping times
MISC	combining stopping rules with active learning algorithms allows us to objectively compare active learning algorithms for a range of different labelling costs
OWNX	section~ introduces the proposed cost function for when labels are costly, while section~ discusses related work
OWNX	section~ derives a bayesian stopping method that utilises the proposed cost function
OWNX	some experimental results illustrating the proposed evaluation methodology and demonstrating the use of the introduced stopping method are presented in section~
MISC	the proposed methods are not flawless, however
MISC	examples, which may interfere with its coupling to an active learning algorithm
OWNX	we conclude with a discussion on the applicability, merits and deficiencies of the proposed approach to optimal stopping and of principled testing for active learning
MISC	the method of defensive forecasting is applied to the problem of prediction with expert advice for binary outcomes
MISC	there are many known techniques in competitive on-line prediction, such as following the perturbed leader (see, eg ,  citation ), bayes-type aggregation (see, eg ,  citation ) and the closely related potential methods, gradient descent (see, eg ,  citation ) and closely related exponentiated gradient descent  citation , and the recently developed technique of defensive forecasting (see, eg ,  citation )
MISC	see  citation  for a general review of competitive on-line prediction
MISC	the necessary and sufficient condition is that the loss function should ``perfectly mixable'' (see for a definition)
OWNX	for simplicity, we first consider two specific, perhaps most important, examples of perfectly mixable loss functions: the quadratic loss function in and the log loss function in \s
MISC	those two sections are self-contained in that they do not require familiarity with the aa
OWNX	in the last section, \s, we establish the general result, for arbitrary perfectly mixable loss functions
MISC	it is not clear that second-guessing experts can be handled at all by the aa
MISC	for a more down-to-earth example of a useful second-guessing expert, remember that humans tend to give too categorical (i e , close to 0 or 1) predictions; therefore, a useful second-guessing expert for a human learner would transform his/her predictions to less categorical ones (according to the learner's expected calibration curve  citation )
AIMX	we introduce an approach to inferring the causal architecture of stochastic dynamical systems that extends rate distortion theory to use causal shielding---a natural principle of learning
OWNX	we study two distinct cases of causal inference: optimal causal filtering and optimal causal estimation
OWNX	we show that, in the limit in which a model complexity constraint is relaxed, filtering finds the exact causal architecture of a stochastic dynamical system, known as the  causal-state partition
MISC	from this, one can estimate the amount of historical information the process stores
MISC	abrupt changes in the hierarchy, as a function of approximation, capture distinct scales of structural organization
OWNX	for nonideal cases with finite data, we show how the correct number of underlying causal states can be found by optimal causal estimation
MISC	time series modeling has a long and important history in science and engineering
MISC	advances in dynamical systems over the last half century led to new methods that attempt to account for the inherent nonlinearity in many natural phenomena  citation
MISC	as a result, it is now well known that nonlinear systems produce highly correlated time series that are not adequately modeled under the typical statistical assumptions of linearity, independence, and identical distributions
MISC	one consequence, exploited in novel state-space reconstruction methods  citation , is that discovering the hidden structure of such processes is key to successful modeling and prediction  citation
MISC	in an attempt to unify the alternative nonlinear modeling approaches, computational mechanics  citation  introduced a minimal representation---the \em---for stochastic dynamical systems that is an optimal predictor and from which many system properties can be directly calculated
MISC	citation , a system's effective states are those variables that  causally shield  a system's past from its future---capturing, in the present, information from the past that predicts the future
OWNX	we do this by using the information bottleneck method (ib)  citation  together with a complexity control method discussed by ref
MISC	citation , which is necessary for learning from finite data
MISC	ref
MISC	citation  lays out the relationship between computational mechanics and the information bottleneck method
OWNX	here, we make the mathematical connection for times series, introducing a new method
OWNX	we adapt ib to time series prediction, resulting in a method we call  optimal causal filtering  (ocf)
MISC	citation
MISC	for example, one can calculate fundamental invariants---such as, symmetries, entropy rate, and stored information---of the original system
MISC	to handle finite-data fluctuations, ocf is extended to  optimal causal estimation  (oce)
MISC	when probabilities are estimated from finite data, errors due to statistical fluctuations in probability estimates must be taken into account in order to avoid over-fitting
MISC	such a convergence result would be particularly interesting and natural, since randomness can be defined in terms of  symbol  itself
OWNX	we also provide a positive answer for some non-universal semimeasures
MISC	the hellinger distance measuring closeness of two distributions plays a central role
MISC	a sequence prediction task is defined as to predict the next symbol  symbol  from an observed sequence  symbol
MISC	the key concept to attack general prediction problems is occam's razor, and to a less extent epicurus' principle of multiple explanations
MISC	solomonoff  citation  formalized and combined both principles in his universal a priori semimeasure  symbol  which assigns high/low probability to simple/complex environments  symbol , hence implementing occam and epicurus
MISC	formally it can be represented as a mixture of all enumerable semimeasures
MISC	an abstract characterization of  symbol  by levin  citation  is that  symbol  is a universal enumerable semimeasure in the sense that it multiplicatively dominates all enumerable semimeasures
MISC	solomonoff's  citation  central result is that if the probability  symbol  of observing  symbol  at time  symbol , given past observations  symbol  is a computable function, then the universal predictor  symbol  converges (rapidly )  with  symbol -probability 1  (w p 1) for  symbol  to the optimal/true/informed predictor  symbol , hence  symbol  represents a universal predictor in case of unknown ``true'' distribution  symbol
MISC	convergence of  symbol  to  symbol  w p 1 tells us that  symbol  is close to  symbol  for sufficiently large  symbol  for almost all sequences  symbol
MISC	it says nothing about whether convergence is true for any  particular  sequence (of measure 0)
MISC	martin-l{\"o}f (m l ) randomness is the standard notion for randomness of individual sequences  citation
MISC	a m l -random sequence passes  all  thinkable effective randomness tests, eg \ the law of large numbers, the law of the iterated logarithm, etc
MISC	in particular, the set of all  symbol -random sequences has  symbol -measure 1
MISC	it is natural to ask whether  symbol  converges to  symbol  (in difference or ratio) individually for all m l -random sequences
MISC	clearly, solomonoff's result shows that convergence may at most fail for a set of sequences with  symbol -measure zero
MISC	a convergence result for m l -random sequences would be particularly interesting and natural in this context, since m l -randomness can be defined in terms of  symbol  itself  citation
MISC	despite several attempts to solve this problem  citation , it remained open  citation
AIMX	in this paper we construct an m l -random sequence and show the existence of a universal semimeasure which does not converge on this sequence, hence answering the open question negatively for some  symbol
MISC	it remains open whether there exist (other) universal semimeasures, probably with particularly interesting additional structure and properties, for which m l -convergence holds
OWNX	we show m l -convergence of predictor  symbol  to  symbol  and of  symbol  to  symbol
MISC	the hellinger distance measuring closeness of two predictive distributions plays a central role in this work
MISC	both results can be derived from a bound on the expected hellinger sum
OWNX	we present an improved bound on the expected exponentiated hellinger sum, which implies very strong assertions on the convergence rate
OWNX	in section~ we investigate whether convergence for all martin-l{\"o}f random sequences hold
OWNX	we give a non-constructive and a constructive proof of different virtue
OWNX	in section~ we present our main positive result
OWNX	we derive a finite bound on the hellinger sum between  symbol  and  symbol , which is exponential in the randomness deficiency of the sequence and double exponential in the complexity of  symbol
OWNX	section~ contains discussion and outlook
OWNX	we extend mccallum's (1995) nearest-sequence memory algorithm to allow for general metrics over state-action trajectories
OWNX	we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by successfully running our algorithm on a real mobile robot
MISC	together this allows learning from much less experience compared to previous methods
MISC	the realization of fully autonomous robots will require algorithms that can learn from direct experience obtained from visual input
MISC	vision systems provide a rich source of information, but, the piecewise-continuous (pwc) structure of the perceptual space (e g video images) implied by typical mobile robot environments is not compatible with most current, on-line reinforcement learning approaches
MISC	these environments are characterized by regions of smooth continuity separated by discontinuities that represent the boundaries of physical objects or the sudden appearance or disappearance of objects in the visual field
MISC	there are two broad approaches that are used to adapt existing algorithms to real world environments: (1) discretizing the state space with fixed~ citation  or adaptive~ citation  grids, and (2) using a function approximator such as a neural-network~ citation , radial basis functions (rbfs)~ citation , cmac~ citation , or instance-based memory~ citation
MISC	fixed discrete grids introduce artificial discontinuities, while adaptive ones scale exponentially with state space dimensionality
MISC	neural networks implement relatively smooth global functions that are not capable of approximating discontinuities, and rbfs and cmacs, like fixed grid methods, require knowledge of the appropriate local scale
MISC	if instead we use a fixed number  symbol  of neighbors (in effect using a variable radius) the approximator has arbitrary resolution near important state space boundaries where it is most needed to accurately model the local dynamics
MISC	to use such an approach,  an appropriate metric is needed to determine which stored instances provide the most relevant information for deciding what to do in a given situation~ citation
MISC	apart from the pwc structure of the perceptual space, a robot learning algorithm must also cope with the fact that instantaneous sensory readings alone rarely provide sufficient information for the robot to determine where it is (localization problem) and what action it is best to take
MISC	some form of short-term memory is needed to integrate successive inputs and identify the underlying environment states that are otherwise only  partially observable
AIMX	in this paper, we present an algorithm called piecewise continuous nearest sequence memory (pc-nsm) that extends mccallum's instance-based algorithm for discrete, partially observable state spaces, nearest sequence memory (nsm;~ citation ), to the more general pwc case
MISC	an important priority in this work is minimizing the amount of  a priori  knowledge about the structure of the environment that is available to the learner
MISC	typically, artificial learning is conducted in simulation, and then the resulting policy is transfered to the real robot
CONT	building an accurate model of a real environment is human-resource intensive and only really achievable when simple  sensors are used (unlike full-scale vision), while overly simplified models make policy transfer difficult~ citation
OWNX	the next section introduces pc-nsm, section~ presents our experiments in robot navigation, and section~ discusses our results and future directions for our research
MISC	the purpose of this note is to show how the method of maximum entropy in the mean (mem) may be used to improve parametric estimation when the measurements are corrupted by large level of noise
OWNX	we compare the performance of our method with the bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches
MISC	suppose that you want to measure the half-life of a decaying nucleus or the life-time of some elementary particle, or some other random variable modeled by an exponential distribution describing, say a decay time or the life time of a process
MISC	assume as well that the noise in the measurement process can be modeled by a centered gaussian random variable whose variance may be of the same order of magnitude as that of the decay rate to be measured
MISC	to make things worse, assume that you can only collect very few measurements
MISC	that is if  symbol  denotes the realized value of the variable, one can only measure  symbol , for  symbol , where  symbol  is a small mumbler, say  symbol  or  symbol  and  symbol  denotes the additive measurement noise
MISC	in other words, assume that you know that the sample comes from a specific parametric distribution but is contaminated by additive noise
MISC	what to do
MISC	one possible approach is to apply small sample statistical estimation procedures
OWNX	for this we recast the problem as a typical inverse problem consisting of solving for  symbol  in  symbol }   where  symbol  is a convex set in  symbol ,  symbol  and for some  symbol  and  symbol , and  symbol  is an  symbol -matrix which depends on how we rephrase the our problem
MISC	we could, for example, consider the following problem: find  symbol  such that   symbol }  in our case  symbol , and we set  symbol  or we could consider a collection of  symbol  such problems, one for every measurement, and then proceed to carry on the estimation
OWNX	see navaza (1986) for an early development and dacunha-castele and camboa (1990) for full mathematical treatment
OWNX	below we shall briefly review what the method is about and then apply it to  obtain an estimator  symbol  from ()
OWNX	we devote section 4 to some simulations in which the method is compared with a bayesian and a maximum likelihood approaches
MISC	but standard statistical guidelines for choosing the model class and prior are not always available or can fail, in particular in complex situations
MISC	i show that solomonoff's model possesses many desirable properties: strong total and future bounds, and weak instantaneous bounds, and in contrast to most classical continuous prior densities has no zero p(oste)rior problem, ie \ can confirm universal hypotheses, is reparametrization and regrouping invariant, and avoids the old-evidence and updating problem
MISC	it even performs well (actually better) in non-computable environments \ifjournal
MISC	given the weather in the past, what is the probability of rain tomorrow
MISC	given historic stock-charts, can one predict the quotes of tomorrow
MISC	assuming the sun rose 5000 years every day, how likely is doomsday (that the sun does not rise) tomorrow
MISC	these are instances of the important problem of induction or time-series forecasting or sequence prediction
MISC	finding prediction rules for every particular (new) problem is possible but cumbersome and prone to disagreement or contradiction
MISC	what is desirable is a formal general theory for prediction
MISC	the bayesian framework is the most consistent and successful framework developed thus far  citation
MISC	in a prequential  citation  or transductive  citation  setting, one directly determines the predictive probability of the next symbol  symbol  without the intermediate step of identifying a (true or good or causal or useful) model
MISC	note that classification and regression can be regarded as special sequence prediction problems, where the sequence  symbol  of  symbol -pairs is given and the class label or function value  symbol  shall be predicted
MISC	solomonoff's  citation  rigorous, essentially unique, formal, and universal solution to this problem is to consider a single large universal class  symbol  suitable for  all  induction problems
MISC	the corresponding universal prior  symbol  is biased towards simple environments in such a way that it dominates (=superior to) all other priors
MISC	this leads to an a priori probability  symbol  which is equivalent to the probability that a universal turing machine with random input tape outputs  symbol , and the shortest program computing  symbol  produces the most likely continuation (prediction) of  symbol
MISC	many interesting, important, and deep results have been proven for solomonoff's universal distribution  symbol   citation
AIMX	the motivation and goal of this paper is % to provide a broad discussion of how and in which sense universal sequence prediction solves all kinds of (philosophical) problems of bayesian sequence prediction, and to % present some recent results
MISC	i hope that the exposition stimulates such a future, more detailed, investigation
OWNX	in section , i review the excellent predictive and decision-theoretic performance results of bayesian sequence prediction for generic (non- iid  )\ countable and continuous model classes
OWNX	section  critically reviews the classical principles (indifference, symmetry, minimax) for obtaining objective priors, introduces the universal prior inspired by occam's razor and quantified in terms of kolmogorov complexity
OWNX	in section  (for  iid  \  symbol ) and section  (for universal  symbol ) i show various desirable properties of the universal prior and class (non-zero p(oste)rior, confirmation of universal hypotheses, reparametrization and regrouping invariance, no old-evidence and updating problem) in contrast to (most) classical continuous prior densities
OWNX	i also complement the general total bounds of section  with some universal and some  iid 
OWNX	section  contains critique, summary, and conclusions
MISC	the reparametrization and regrouping invariance, the (weak) instantaneous bounds, the good performance of  symbol  in non-computable environments, and most of the discussion (zero prior and universal hypotheses, old evidence) are new or new in the light of universal sequence prediction
MISC	in many real world applications, data cannot be accurately represented by vectors
MISC	in those situations, one possible solution is to rely on dissimilarity measures that enable sensible comparison between observations
OWNX	moreover, we introduce implementation methods that result in very short running times
MISC	improvements deduced from the theoretical cost model are validated on simulated and real world data (a word list clustering problem)
OWNX	we also demonstrate that the proposed implementation methods reduce by a factor up to 3 the running time of the fast algorithm over a standard implementation
MISC	unfortunately, many real world data depart strongly from this model
MISC	it is quite common for instance to have variable size data
MISC	they are natural for example in online handwriting recognition  citation  where the representation of a character drawn by the user can vary in length because of the drawing conditions
MISC	while a lot of work has been done to adapt classical data analysis methods to structured data such as tree and graph  citation  for neural based unsupervised processing of structured data and also  citation }, as well as to data with varying size, there is still a strong need for efficient and flexible data analysis methods that can be applied to any type of data
MISC	a way to design such methods is to rely on one to one comparison between observations
MISC	it is in general possible to define a similarity or a dissimilarity measure between arbitrary data, as long as comparing them is meaningful
MISC	in general, data analysis algorithms based solely on (dis)similarities between observations are more complex than their vector counterparts, but they are universal and can therefore be applied to any kind of data
MISC	moreover, they allow one to rely on specific (dis)similarities constructed by experts rather than on a vector representation of the data that induces in general unwanted distortion in the observations
MISC	many algorithms have been adapted to use solely dissimilarities between data
MISC	in the clustering field, the k-means algorithm  citation  has been adapted to dissimilarity data under the name of partitioning around medoids  citation
MISC	more recently, approaches based on deterministic annealing have been used to propose another class of extensions of the k-means principle  citation
MISC	following the path taken for the k-means, several adaptation of kohonen's self-organizing map  citation  to dissimilarity data have been proposed
OWNX	citation  proposed a probabilistic formulation of the som that can be used directly for dissimilarity data
MISC	deterministic annealing schemes have been also used for the som  citation
AIMX	in the present paper, we focus on an adaptation proposed in  citation , where it was applied successfully to a protein sequence clustering and visualization problem, as well as to string clustering problems
MISC	this generalization is called the dissimilarity som (dsom, also known as the median som), and can be considered as a som formulation of the pam method
MISC	a major drawback of the dsom is that its running time can be very high, especially when compared to the standard vector som
MISC	it is well known that the som algorithm behaves linearly with the number of input data  citation
OWNX	on the contrary, the dsom behaves quadratically with this number (see section )
AIMX	we propose in this paper several modifications of the basic algorithm that allow a much faster implementation
MISC	moreover, a specific implementation strategy reduces the actual computation burden even more
OWNX	an important property of all our modifications is that the obtained algorithm produces  exactly  the same results as the standard dsom algorithm
OWNX	in section  we recall the som adaptation to dissimilarity data and obtain the theoretical cost of the dsom
OWNX	in section , we describe our proposed new algorithm as well as the implementation techniques that decrease its running time in practice
OWNX	finally we evaluate the algorithm in section
MISC	this evaluation validates the theoretical cost model and shows that the implementation methods reduce the running time
MISC	in data analysis new forms of complex data have to be considered like for example (symbolic data, functional data, web data, trees, sql query and multimedia data,
OWNX	to this end, %%@ we propose an extension of the self-organizing map that can handle symbolic data \\  keywords:  classification, self organizing map, symbolic data, dissimilarity
MISC	the self-organizing map(som) introduced by kohonen  citation  is an unsupervised neural network method which has both clustering and visualization %%@ properties
MISC	it can be considered as an algorithm that maps a high dimensional data space,  symbol , to a lower dimension, generally 2, and which %%@ is called a map
MISC	its most similar %%@ predecessors are the k-means algorithm  citation  and the dynamic clustering method  citation , which operate as a som without topology preservation %%@ and therefore without easy visualization
MISC	in order to solve this problem, %%@ several methods can be considered depending on the type of data (for example projection operators %%@ for functional data  citation )
MISC	however, those methods are not fully general and an adaptation of every data analysis algorithm to the resulting %%@ data is needed
MISC	the kohonen's som is based on the center of gravity notion and unfortunately, this concept is not applicable to many kinds of complex data
OWNX	our goal is to modify the som algorithm to allow its implementation on dissimilarity measures rather than on raw data
OWNX	to this end, we take one's inspiration from the work of kohonen  citation
MISC	to apply the method, only the definition of a dissimilarity for each type of data is necessary and so complex data can be processed
MISC	the large number of spectral variables in most data sets encountered in spectral chemometrics often renders the prediction of a dependent variable uneasy
MISC	it has two drawbacks however: the number of groups of variables to test is still huge, and colinearities can make the results unstable
MISC	it consists in a forward-backward procedure applied to the coefficients of a b-spline representation of the spectra
OWNX	the spline representation is used to get interpretability of the results, as groups of consecutive spectral variables will be selected
MISC	prediction problems are often encountered in analytical spectral chemometrics
MISC	they require estimating the unknown value of a dependent variable from, for example, a near-infrared spectrum
MISC	such problems may be encountered in the food  citation , pharmaceutical  citation  and textile  citation  industry, to cite only a few
MISC	viewed from a statistical or data analysis perspective, the main difficulty in such problem is to cope with the colinearity between spectral variables: not only consecutive variables in a spectrum are highly correlated by nature, but in addition real applications usually concern databases with a low number of known spectra, and a high number of spectral variables
MISC	any method built on the original spectral variables is thus ill-posed, making feature (spectral variable) selection and/or projection necessary
MISC	selection and projection methods differ by several aspects
MISC	projection methods are more general by essence, as selection may be regarded as projection with many zero weights
MISC	however, projection methods usually build factors (latent variables) that are combinations of a large number of original features
MISC	even if their prediction properties are good, they usually suffer from the fact that the latent variables are hardly interpretable in terms of original features (wavelengths in the case of infrared spectra)
MISC	of course, the challenge with selection methods is to obtain prediction performances of the same level as projection ones
MISC	nonlinear models could be used in a wrapper approach  citation , in which their estimated generalization performances is used as a relevance criterion for a group of variables
MISC	this however, is very demanding in terms of computational load because resampling techniques must be used to estimate accurately the predicted error of the model, in addition to the fact that one model must be learned for each considered feature set
OWNX	among filter methods, the correlation is the standard criterion to be used for selecting features in a linear way: features with maximal correlation with the dependent (output) variable, and possibly with minimal information between them to avoid redundancy, are selected
MISC	mutual information (see eg citation ) extends the correlation to the measure of nonlinear dependencies, while correlation is strictly limited to linear ones
MISC	as an example, the correlation between a centered antisymmetric variable and its second power is zero, despite the fact they obviously depend one from another (though in a nonlinear way)
MISC	the mutual information avoids this drawback, providing a more general and less restricted way to measure dependencies between variables
MISC	the mutual information (mi) has already been used to select variables from near-infrared spectra  citation
MISC	despite it provides a promising way to extend state-of-the-art spectral analysis to nonlinear methodologies, the direct selection of variables by mi suffers from some drawbacks
OWNX	first, the mi estimation becomes difficult as the number of selected variables grows
MISC	finally, even though the estimation of the mutual information is less demanding in terms of computation time than the construction of a nonlinear model, the large number of initial variables results in high computation times for the selection
AIMX	in this paper, we propose to first reduce the number of variables through a projection of the spectral features before the selection by mutual information
MISC	to maintain the interpretability despite the use of a projection, the latter is achieved by ensuring that each coordinate in the projection corresponds to a restricted set of initial features with consecutive wavelengths
MISC	the general methodology proposed in  citation  is followed: spectra are projected on a functional basis
MISC	more precisely, as in eg citation , a projection on a basis of b-splines is chosen, rather than wavelets for example; indeed b-splines have the advantage that they span a restricted interval of wavelengths, and that the intervals are roughly of the same length over the whole range
MISC	as a consequence, each coefficient depends on the value of the corresponding spectrum on a limited wavelength interval
MISC	the complete procedure then consists in replacing the spectra by their b-spline coefficients, in selecting relevant coefficients by measuring their mutual information with the output variable, and by predicting the latter using radial-basis function networks (any other nonlinear model could be used)
MISC	design parameters that are unavoidable in a nonlinear context, such as the number of b-splines to be used in the projection, are set automatically (without the necessity of a user's choice) using a cross-validation method
OWNX	in addition interpretability is added, as the number of wavelengths selected by the procedure remains low, making it possible to identify which wavelengths are responsible for the phenomenon to predict
MISC	moreover, b-spline compression allows us both to reduce the feature selection running time and to increase the quality of the prediction results compared to the same nonlinear procedure applied directly to the original spectral variables
OWNX	section  presents the mutual information criterion and its use in a forward-backward procedure
OWNX	section  shows examples of the application of the proposed method on two data sets
MISC	the first one consists of nir spectra obtained from fescue grass; the aim is to predict the nitrogen content of the plant
MISC	the second one is a database of spectra from fuel samples for which the goal is to predict the cetane number of the fuel
OWNX	combining the mutual information criterion with a forward feature selection strategy offers a good trade-off between optimality of the selected feature subset and computation time
MISC	however, it requires to set the parameter(s) of the mutual information estimator and to determine when to halt the forward procedure
MISC	the resampling methods bring information about the variance of the estimator, information which can then be used to automatically set the parameter and to calculate a threshold to stop the forward procedure
MISC	the procedure is illustrated on a synthetic dataset as well as on real-world examples
MISC	feature selection consists in choosing, among a set of input features, or variables, the subset of features that has maximum prediction power for the output
MISC	the task of feature selection consists in finding the features  symbol  that are most relevant to predict the value of  symbol   citation
MISC	these methods are indeed    quite sensitive to irrelevant inputs: their performances tend to decrease when useless variables are added to the data
MISC	in such cases, furthermore, most methods that `work backwards' by eliminating useless features perform badly
MISC	the backward elimination procedure for instance, or pruning methods for the multilayer perceptron  citation , svm-based feature selection  citation , or weighting methods like the generalized relevance learning vector quantization algorithm  citation  require building a model with all initial features
MISC	with high-dimensional data,  this will often lead to large computation times, overfitting, convergence problems, and, more generally, issues related to the curse of dimensionality
MISC	these approaches are furthermore bound to a specific prediction model
MISC	by contrast, a forward feature selection procedure can be applied using any model and begins with small feature subsets
MISC	such procedure is furthermore simple and often efficient
OWNX	nevertheless, when data are high-dimensional, it becomes difficult to perform the forward search using the prediction model directly
MISC	a cheaper alternative is to estimate the relevance of each candidate subset with a statistical or information-theoretic measure, without using the prediction model itself
MISC	the combined use of a forward feature search and an information-theoretic-based relevance criterion  is generally considered to be a good option, when nonlinear effects prevent from using the correlation coefficient  citation
MISC	in this context, the mutual information estimated using a nearest neighbour-based approach has been shown to be effective  citation
MISC	nevertheless, this approach, just like most feature selection methodologies, faces two difficulties
MISC	the first one, which is generic for all feature selection methods, lies in the optimal choice of the number of features to select
MISC	most of the time, the number of features to select is chosen a priori or so as to maximize the relevance criterion
MISC	the former approach leaves no room for optimization, while the latter may be very sensitive  to the estimation of the relevance criterion
MISC	the second difficulty concerns the choice of parameter(s) in the estimation of the relevance criterion
MISC	often, the result of the selection highly depends on the value of that (those) parameter(s)
MISC	this procedure will be detailed in a situation where the mutual information is used as relevance criterion, and is estimated through nearest neighbours
MISC	resampling methods will be used to obtain this automatic choice
MISC	those methods increase the computational cost of the forward search, but provide meaningful information about the quality of the estimations and the setting of parameters: it will be shown that a permutation test can be used to automatically stop the forward procedure, and that a combination of permutation and k-fold resampling allows choosing the optimal number of neighbors in the estimation of the mutual information
OWNX	section  introduces the mutual information, the permutation test and the k-fold resampling, and briefly reviews how they can be used together
OWNX	section  then presents the proposed approach
OWNX	the performances of the method on real-world data are reported in section
OWNX	% we show that the brier game of prediction is mixable and find the optimal learning rate and substitution function for it
MISC	the resulting prediction algorithm is applied to predict results of football and tennis matches
MISC	the theoretical performance guarantee turns out to be rather tight on these data sets, especially in the case of the more extensive tennis data
MISC	the paradigm of prediction with expert advice was introduced in the late 1980s (see, eg ,  citation ,  citation ,  citation ) and has been applied to various loss functions; see  citation  for a recent book-length review
MISC	an especially important class of loss functions is that of ``mixable'' ones, for which the learner's loss can be made as small as the best expert's loss plus a constant (depending on the number of experts)
MISC	there are several important loss functions that have been shown to be mixable and for which the optimal additive constant has been found
MISC	the prime examples in the case of binary observations are the log loss function and the square loss function
MISC	the log loss function, whose mixability is obvious, has been explored extensively, along with its important generalizations, the kullback--leibler divergence and cover's loss function
MISC	in the binary case, its mixability was demonstrated in  citation
MISC	the mixability of the square loss function in the case of observations belonging to a bounded interval of real numbers was demonstrated in  citation ; haussler et al 's algorithm was simplified in  citation
MISC	surprisingly, the case of square-loss non-binary classification has never been analysed in the framework of prediction with expert advice
MISC	its short conference version  citation  appeared in the icml 2008 proceedings
MISC	one of the most utilized data mining tasks is the search for association rules
MISC	semantically, entity-relationship rules express associations between properties of related objects
MISC	syntactically, these rules are based on a broad subclass of safe domain relational calculus queries
OWNX	we propose a new definition of support and confidence for entity-relationship rules and for the frequency of entity-relationship queries
OWNX	we prove that the definition of frequency satisfies standard probability axioms and the apriori property
MISC	one of the goals of data mining is to discover interesting relationships from data
MISC	association rules express relationships that hold with sufficient frequency but not always
MISC	for example, it may be the case that not all managers earn over \ symbol pq  symbol p symbol q symbol q symbol p symbol p symbol q symbol p symbol q symbol pq symbol p q symbol fr(pq)$
OWNX	our definition of frequency for er queries generalizes previous work on defining association rules in a multi-relational setting
MISC	citation  discusses extending itemset rules with negations and motivates the usefulness of this extension
MISC	the query extension approach of the system  citation  presents a special class of entity-relationship rules that allows conjunctions of nonnegated statements and existential quantification
OWNX	our concept  of er rules %allows features in addition negations, universal quantification, nested quantifiers, and nested boolean combinations
OWNX	a characteristic that distinguishes our approach from previous work is that previous approaches assume a given target table that defines a base set of tuples for evaluating the support of a query
OWNX	in contrast, we start with a query and define a natural base set of tuples for evaluating the support of the query
OWNX	then we introduce the concept of an entity query and define the frequency of a query in this class of queries
OWNX	we compare entity-relationship queries to frequent itemsets and to the rule language of the system
OWNX	the final section establishes sevveral important formal properties of query frequencies as we define them and shows that they satisfy the apriori property, that is, the frequency of a conjunction is no greater than the frequency of its conjuncts
MISC	this complex is a generalization of linear and non-linear principal manifolds and includes them as particular cases
MISC	the problem of optimal principal complex construction is transformed into a series of minimization problems for quadratic functionals
MISC	these quadratic functionals have a physically transparent interpretation in terms of elastic energy
MISC	for the energy computation, the whole complex is represented as a system of nodes and springs
MISC	topologically, the principal complex is a product of one-dimensional continuums (represented by graphs), and the grammars describe how these continuums transform during the process of optimal complex construction
OWNX	the first hypothesis we have to check is: whether the dataset  symbol  is situated near a low--dimensional affine manifold (plane) in  symbol
OWNX	if we look for a point, straight line, plane,
MISC	pca is one of the most seminal inventions in data analysis
MISC	nonlinear generalization of pca is a great challenge, and many attempts have been made to answer it
OWNX	two of them are especially important for our consideration: kohonen's self-organizing maps (som) and principal manifolds
OWNX	with the  som  algorithm  citation  we take a finite metric space  symbol  with metric  symbol  and try to map it into  symbol  with (a) the best preservation of initial structure in the image of  symbol  and (b) the best approximation of the dataset  symbol
MISC	the  som algorithm has several setup variables to regulate the compromise between these goals
OWNX	we start from some initial approximation of the map,  symbol
OWNX	for these  symbol  and  symbol  we define an ``owner" of  symbol  in  symbol :  symbol
MISC	the next approximation,  symbol , is  symbol } here  symbol  is a step size,  symbol  is a monotonically decreasing cutting function
MISC	there are many ways to combine steps () in the whole algorithm
MISC	the attempts to define som as solution of a minimization problem for some energy functional were not very successful  citation
MISC	for a known probability distribution,  principal manifolds  were introduced as lines or surfaces passing through ``the middle'' of the data distribution  citation
MISC	this intuitive vision was transformed into the mathematical notion of  self-consistency : every point  symbol  of the principal manifold  symbol  is a conditional expectation of all points  symbol  that are projected into  symbol
MISC	in order to avoid overfitting, we have to introduce smoothers that become an essential part of the principal manifold construction algorithms
MISC	soms give the most popular approximations for principal manifolds: we can take for  symbol  a fragment of a regular  symbol -dimensional grid and consider the resulting som as the approximation to the  symbol -dimensional principal manifold (see, for example,  citation )
MISC	several original algorithms for construction of principal curves  citation  and surfaces for finite datasets were developed during last decade, as well as many applications of this idea
MISC	in 1996, in a discussion about som at the 5th russian national seminar in neuroinformatics, a method of multidimensional data approximation based on elastic energy minimization was  proposed (see  citation  and the bibliography there)
OWNX	following the metaphor of elasticity, we introduce two quadratic smoothness penalty terms
OWNX	we also  provide an adaptive version that is rank consistent even when the necessary condition for the non adaptive version is not fulfilled
MISC	in recent years, regularization by various non euclidean  norms has seen considerable interest
MISC	when learning on rectangular matrices, the rank is a natural extension of the cardinality, and the sum of singular values, also known as the trace norm or the nuclear norm, is the natural extension of the  symbol -norm; indeed, as the  symbol -norm is the convex envelope of the  symbol -norm on the unit ball (i e , the largest lower bounding convex function)~ citation , the trace norm is the convex envelope of the rank over the unit ball of the spectral norm~ citation
MISC	in practice, it leads to low rank solutions~ citation  and has seen recent increased interest in the context of collaborative filtering~ citation , multi-task learning~ citation  or classification with multiple classes~ citation
OWNX	in \mysec{consistency}, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the rank consistency that are extensions of corresponding results for the lasso~ citation   and the group lasso~ citation
OWNX	we do so under two sets of sampling assumptions detailed in \mysec{assumptions}: a full  iid  assumption and a non  iid  assumption which is natural in the context of collaborative filtering
OWNX	as for the lasso and the group lasso, the necessary condition implies that such procedures do not always estimate the rank correctly; following the adaptive version of the lasso and group lasso~ citation , we design an adaptive version to achieve  symbol -consistency and rank consistency, with no consistency conditions
OWNX	finally,  in \mysec{algorithms}, we present a smoothing approach to convex optimization with the trace norm, while  in \mysec{simulations}, we show simulations on toy examples to illustrate the consistency results
MISC	the reduction guarantees an average pairwise misranking regret of at most that of the binary classifier regret, improving a recent result of balcan et al which only guarantees a factor of  symbol
OWNX	moreover, our reduction applies to a broader class of ranking loss functions, admits a simpler proof, and the expected running time complexity of our algorithm in terms of number of calls to a classifier or preference function is improved from  symbol  to  symbol
OWNX	much of our results also extend beyond the bipartite case previously studied
OWNX	our rediction is a randomized one
OWNX	to complement our result, we  also derive lower bounds on any deterministic reduction from  binary (preference) classification to ranking, implying that our use of a randomized reduction is essentially necessary for the guarantees we provide
MISC	the learning problem of ranking arises in many modern applications, including the design of search engines, information extraction, and movie recommendation systems
MISC	in these applications, the ordering of the documents or movies returned is a critical aspect of the system
MISC	the problem has been formulated within two distinct settings
MISC	in the  score-based setting , the learning algorithm receives a labeled sample of pairwise preferences and returns a  scoring function   symbol  which induces a linear ordering of the points in the set  symbol
MISC	test points are simply ranked according to the values of  symbol  for those points
MISC	several ranking algorithms, including rankboost  citation , svm-type ranking  citation , and other algorithms such as prank  citation , were designed for this setting
MISC	generalization bounds have been given in this setting for the pairwise misranking error  citation , including margin-based bounds  citation
OWNX	a somewhat different two-stage scenario was considered in other publications starting with cohen, schapire, and singer  citation , and later balcan et al citation , which we will refer to as the  preference-based setting
MISC	symbol  is typically assumed to be the output of a classification algorithm trained on a sample of labeled pairs, and can be for example a convex combination of simpler preference functions as in  citation
MISC	a crucial difference with the score-based setting is that, in general, the preference function  symbol  does not induce a linear ordering
MISC	this is more likely to be achievable exactly or with a better approximation when the algorithm is requested instead, as in this setting, to supply a linear ordering, only for a limited subset  symbol
MISC	when the preference function is learned by a binary classification algorithm, the preference-based setting can be viewed as a reduction of the ranking problem to a classification one
MISC	the second stage specifies how the ranking is obtained using the preference function
MISC	cohen, schapire, and singer  citation  showed that in the second stage of the preference-based setting, the general problem of finding a linear ordering with as few pairwise misrankings as possible with respect to the preference function  symbol  is np-complete
MISC	the authors presented a greedy algorithm based on the tournament  degree  for each element  symbol  defined as the difference between the number of elements  symbol  is preferred to versus the number of those preferred to  symbol
MISC	the bound proven by these authors, formulated in terms of the pairwise disagreement loss  symbol  with respect to the preference function  symbol , can be written as  symbol , where  symbol  is the loss achieved by the permutation  symbol  returned by their algorithm and  symbol  the one achieved by the optimal permutation  symbol  with respect to the preference function  symbol
MISC	more recently, balcan et al  citation  studied the bipartite ranking problem and showed that sorting the elements of  symbol  according to the same tournament degree used by  citation  guarantees a pairwise misranking regret of at most  symbol  using a binary classifier with regret  symbol
MISC	however, due to the quadratic nature of the definition of the tournament degree, their algorithm requires  symbol  calls to the preference function  symbol , where  symbol  is the number of objects to rank
OWNX	we describe an efficient algorithm for the second stage of preference-based setting and thus for reducing the learning problem of ranking to binary classification
OWNX	our reduction applies (with different constants) to a broader class of ranking loss functions, admits a simpler proof, and the expected running time complexity of our algorithm in terms of number of calls to a classifier or preference function is improved from  symbol  to  symbol
MISC	the algorithm used by balcan et al citation  to produce a ranking based on the preference function is known as sort-by-degree and has been recently used in the context of minimizing the feedback arcset in tournaments  citation
OWNX	here, we use a different algorithm, quicksort, which has also been recently used for minimizing the feedback arcset in tournaments  citation
MISC	the techniques presented make use of the earlier work by ailon et al on combinatorial optimization problems over rankings and clustering  citation
OWNX	in section~, we introduce the definitions and notation used in future sections and introduce a family of general loss functions that can be used to measure the quality of a ranking hypothesis
OWNX	section~ describes a simple and efficient algorithm for reducing ranking to binary classification, proves several bounds guaranteeing the quality of the ranking produced by the algorithm, and shows the running-time complexity of our algorithm to be very efficient
OWNX	in section~ we discuss the relationship of the algorithm and its proof with previous related work in combinatorial optimization
OWNX	in section~ we derive a lower bound of factor  symbol  on any deterministic reduction from  binary (preference) classification to ranking, implying that our use of a randomized reduction is essentially necessary for the improved guarantees we provide
MISC	in recent years, spectral clustering has become one of the most popular modern clustering algorithms
MISC	it is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm
MISC	on the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does
MISC	the goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions
OWNX	we describe different graph laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches
OWNX	clustering is one of the most widely used techniques for exploratory data analysis, with applications ranging from statistics, computer science, biology to social sciences or psychology
MISC	in virtually every scientific field dealing with empirical data, people attempt to get a first impression on their data by trying to identify groups of ``similar behavior'' in their data
OWNX	in this article we would like to introduce the reader to the family of spectral clustering algorithms
MISC	compared to the ``traditional algorithms'' such as  symbol -means or single linkage, spectral clustering has many fundamental advantages
MISC	results obtained by spectral clustering often outperform the traditional approaches, spectral clustering is very simple to implement and can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra methods \\  this tutorial is set up as a self-contained introduction to spectral clustering
OWNX	we derive spectral clustering from scratch and present different points of view to why spectral clustering works
MISC	apart from basic linear algebra, no particular mathematical background is required by the reader
OWNX	the first two sections are devoted to a step-by-step introduction to the mathematical objects used by spectral clustering: similarity graphs in section , and graph laplacians in section
OWNX	the spectral clustering algorithms themselves will be presented in section
OWNX	each section corresponds to one explanation: section  describes a graph partitioning approach, section  a random walk perspective, and section  a perturbation theory approach
OWNX	in section  we will study some practical issues related to spectral clustering, and discuss various extensions and literature related to spectral clustering in section
MISC	building rules on top of ontologies is the ultimate goal of the logical layer of the semantic web
MISC	it is intended to follow the tradition of hybrid knowledge representation and reasoning systems such as  symbol -log that integrates the description logic  symbol  and the function-free horn clausal language \textsc{datalog}
OWNX	we propose a general framework for rule induction that adopts the methodological apparatus of inductive logic programming and relies on the expressive and deductive power of  symbol -log
OWNX	yet, for illustrative purposes, we also discuss an instantiation of the framework which aims at description and turns out to be useful in ontology refinement
MISC	during the last decade increasing attention has been paid on  ontologies  and their role in knowledge engineering  citation
MISC	as such, this system does not depend on a particular language: aristotle's ontology is always the same, independently of the language used to describe it
MISC	on the other hand, in its most prevalent use in artificial intelligence, an ontology refers to an engineering artifact (more precisely, produced according to the principles of  ontological engineering   citation ), constituted by a specific vocabulary used to describe a certain reality, plus a set of explicit assumptions regarding the intended meaning of the vocabulary words
MISC	this set of assumptions has usually the form of a first-order logical theory, where vocabulary words appear as unary or binary predicate names, respectively called concepts and relations
MISC	in the simplest case, an ontology describes a hierarchy of concepts related by subsumption relationships; in more sophisticated cases, suitable axioms are added in order to express other relationships between concepts and to constrain their intended interpretation
MISC	among the other things, this definition emphasizes the fact that an ontology has to be specified in a language that comes with a formal semantics
MISC	only by using such a formal approach ontologies provide the machine interpretable meaning of concepts and relations that is expected when using an ontology-based approach
MISC	note that dls are decidable fragments of first order logic (fol) that are incomparable with horn clausal logic (hcl) as regards the expressive power  citation  and the semantics  citation  } ontology engineering, notably its dl-based approach, is playing a relevant role in the definition of the  semantic web
MISC	the semantic web is the vision of the world wide web enriched by machine-processable information which supports the user in his tasks  citation
MISC	the architecture of the semantic web is shown in figure
MISC	it consists of several layers, each of which is equipped with an ad-hoc mark-up language
MISC	in particular, the design of the mark-up language for the  ontological layer , owl}, has been based on the very expressive dl  symbol   citation
MISC	whereas owl is already undergoing the standardization process at w3c, the debate around a unified language for  rules  is still ongoing
MISC	the motivation for investigating and developing such systems is to improve on two basic features of kr\&r formalisms, namely  representational adequacy  and  deductive power , by preserving the other crucial feature, i e decidability
MISC	in particular, combining dls with hcl can easily yield to undecidability if the interface between them is not reduced  citation
MISC	the hybrid system  symbol -log integrates  symbol   citation  and \textsc{datalog}  citation  by using  symbol  concept assertions essentially as type constraints on variables
MISC	defining rules (including the ones for the semantic web) has been usually considered as a demanding task from the viewpoint of knowledge engineering
MISC	it is often supported by machine learning algorithms that can vary in the approaches
MISC	the approach known under the name of inductive logic programming (ilp) seems to be promising for the case at hand due to the common roots with logic programming  citation
MISC	ilp has been historically concerned with rule induction from examples and background knowledge within the representation framework of hcl and with the aim of prediction  citation
MISC	more recently ilp has moved towards either different fol fragments (e g , dls) or new learning goals (e g , description)
OWNX	for the sake of illustration we concentrate on an instantiation of the framework for the case of description
OWNX	section  introduces the basic notions of  symbol -log
OWNX	section  defines the framework for learning rules in  symbol -log
MISC	higher-order tensor decompositions are analogous to the familiar singular value decomposition (svd), but they transcend the limitations of matrices (second-order tensors)
MISC	svd is a powerful tool that has achieved impressive results in information retrieval, collaborative filtering, computational linguistics, computational vision, and other fields
MISC	however, svd is limited to two-dimensional arrays of data (two modes), and many potential applications have three or more modes, which require higher-order tensor decompositions
OWNX	we measure the time (elapsed run time), space (ram and disk space requirements), and fit (tensor reconstruction accuracy) of the four algorithms, under a variety of conditions
OWNX	we recommend hooi for tensors that are small enough for the available ram and mp for larger tensors
MISC	singular value decomposition (svd) is growing increasingly popular as a tool for the analysis of two-dimensional arrays of data, due to its success in a wide variety of applications, such as information retrieval  citation , collaborative filtering  citation , computational linguistics  citation , computational vision  citation , and genomics  citation
MISC	svd is limited to two-dimensional arrays (matrices or second-order tensors), but many applications require higher-dimensional arrays, known as higher-order tensors
MISC	there are several higher-order tensor decompositions, analogous to svd, that are able to capture higher-order structure that cannot be modeled with two dimensions (two modes)
MISC	higher-order generalizations of svd include higher-order singular value decomposition (ho\nobreakdash-svd)  citation , tucker decomposition  citation , and parafac (parallel factor analysis)  citation , which is also known as candecomp (canonical decomposition)  citation
MISC	the number of elements in a matrix increases quadratically, as the product of the number of rows and columns, but the number of elements in a third-order tensor increases cubically, as a product of the number of rows, columns, and tubes
MISC	thus there is a need for tensor decomposition algorithms that can handle large tensors
OWNX	our main concern is the ability of the four algorithms to scale up to large tensors
OWNX	in section~, we motivate this work by listing some of the applications for higher-order tensors
MISC	in any field where svd has been useful, there is likely to be a third or fourth mode that has been ignored, because svd only handles two modes
OWNX	we follow the notational conventions of \newcite{kolda2006moh}
OWNX	section~ presents the four algorithms, ho\nobreakdash-svd, hooi, sp, and mp
MISC	for ho\nobreakdash-svd and hooi, we used the implementations given in the matlab tensor toolbox  citation
OWNX	for sp and mp, we created our own matlab implementations
OWNX	our implementation of mp for third-order tensors is given in the appendix
OWNX	section~ presents our empirical evaluation of the four tensor decomposition algorithms
OWNX	in the experiments, we measure the time (elapsed run time), space (ram and disk space requirements), and fit (tensor reconstruction accuracy) of the four algorithms, under a variety of conditions
OWNX	we test the algorithms with random sparse third-order tensors as input
OWNX	the second group of experiments examines the sensitivity of the fit to the balance in the ratios of the core sizes (defined in section~)
MISC	the third group explores the fit with varying ratios between the size of the input tensor and the size of the core tensor
OWNX	for this group, we move from third-order tensors to fourth-order tensors
MISC	the algorithms are tested with random fourth-order tensors, with the input tensor size fixed while the core sizes vary
OWNX	we conclude in section~
MISC	there are tradeoffs in time, space, and fit for the four algorithms, such that there is no absolute winner among the four algorithms
MISC	the choice will depend on the time, space, and fit requirements of the given application
MISC	%\baselineskip=18pt recent spectral clustering methods are a propular and powerful technique for data clustering
MISC	these methods need to solve the eigenproblem whose computational complexity is  symbol , where  symbol  is the number of data samples
MISC	its performance is comparable to the spectral clustering algorithms but it is more efficient with computational complexity  symbol
OWNX	we show that with a transitive distance and an observed property, called k-means duality, our algorithm can be used to handle data sets with complex cluster shapes, multi-scale clusters, and noise
OWNX	moreover, no parameters except the number of clusters need to be set in our algorithm
MISC	data clustering is an important technique in many applications such as data mining, image processing, pattern recognition, and computer vision
MISC	much effort has been devoted to this research~ citation ,  citation ,  citation ,  citation ,  citation ,  citation ,  citation ,  citation
MISC	a basic principle (assumption) that guides the design of a clustering algorithm is:    consistency :  data within the same cluster are closed to  each other, while data belonging to different clusters are relatively far away
MISC	according to this principle, the hierarchy approach  citation  begins with a trivial clustering scheme where every sample is a cluster, and then iteratively finds the closest (most similar) pairs of clusters and merges them into larger clusters
MISC	an easily observed disadvantage of this approach is that it often fails when a data set consists of multi-scale clusters  citation
MISC	with the introduction of kernels, many recent methods like spectral clustering  citation ,  citation  consider that clusters in a data set may have more complex shapes other than compact sample clouds
MISC	in  citation , the eigenvectors of the distance matrix play a key role in clustering
MISC	to overcome the problems such as multi-scale clusters in  citation , zelnik-manor and perona proposed self-tuning spectral clustering, in which the local scale of the data and the structure of the eigenvectors of the distance matrix are considered~ citation
MISC	impressive results have been demonstrated by spectral clustering and it is regarded as the most promising clustering technique  citation
MISC	however, most of the current kernel related clustering methods, including spectral clustering that is unified to the kernel k-means framework in  citation , need to solve the eigenproblem, suffering from high computational cost when the data set is large
OWNX	with comparable performance to the spectral algorithms, our algorithm does not need to solve the eigenproblem and is more efficient with computational complexity  symbol  than the spectral algorithms whose complexities are  symbol , where  symbol  is the number of samples in a data set
OWNX	in section~, we discuss the transitive distance measure through a graph model of a data set
OWNX	in section~, the duality of the k-means algorithm is proposed and its application to our clustering algorithm is explained
OWNX	section~ describes our algorithm and presents a scheme to reduce the computational complexity
OWNX	section~ shows experimental results on some synthetic data sets and benchmark data sets, together with comparisons to the k-means algorithm and the spectral algorithms in  citation  and  citation
OWNX	the conclusions are given in section~
MISC	it also shows, given such an optimal similarity measure, how to construct a classifier that outperforms the nearest neighbor classifier and achieves bayes-optimal classification rates
OWNX	the paper then analyzes bayesian similarity in a framework where a classifier faces a number of related classification tasks (multitask learning) and illustrates that reconstruction of the class posterior distribution is not possible in general
MISC	statistical models of similarity have become increasingly important in recent work on information retrieval  citation , case-based reasoning  citation , pattern recognition citation , and computer vision  citation
OWNX	of particular interest is bayesian similarity, a discriminatively trained model of  symbol , which we will abbreviate as  symbol
MISC	these models have been demonstrated to work well in a number of pattern recognition and visual object recognition problems  citation
MISC	it is easy to see that nearest neighbor classification using  symbol  minimizes the risk that the class labels for  symbol  and  symbol  differ and therefore is optimal for 1-nearest neighbor classification  citation
MISC	however, beyond that observation, there have been several kinds of analysis of bayesian similarity
MISC	the first, presented by mahamud  citation  is an analysis considering a single instance of a classification problem, determined by a joint distribution  symbol  of class labels  symbol  and feature vectors  symbol
MISC	the authors also argue for the existence of useful invariance properties of bayesian similarity functions when those functions have a specific form  citation
MISC	learning machines that have  hierarchical structures or hidden variables  are singular statistical models because they are nonidentifiable and  their fisher information matrices are singular
MISC	this is the main reason that it has been difficult to  predict their generalization performance from trained states
MISC	recently, many learning machines are being used in information processing systems
MISC	for  example, layered neural networks, normal mixtures, binomial mixtures, bayes networks, boltzmann machines, reduced rank regressions, hidden markov models, and stochastic context-free grammars  are being employed in pattern recognition, time series  prediction, robotic control, human modeling,  and biostatistics
MISC	although their generalization performances determine the accuracy of the information systems,  it has been difficult to estimate generalization  errors based on training errors, because such  learning machines are singular statistical models
MISC	a parametric model is called regular if the mapping from the parameter to the  probability distribution is one-to-one and if its fisher information matrix is always positive definite
MISC	if a statistical model is regular, then  the bayes  a posteriori  distribution converges to the normal distribution,  and the maximum likelihood estimator satisfies  asymptotic normality
MISC	based on such properties,  the relation between the generalization error and the training error was clarified, on which some information criteria  were proposed
MISC	on the other hand, if the mapping from the  parameter to the probability distribution is not one-to-one or if the fisher information matrix is  singular, then the parametric model is called singular
MISC	in general, if a learning machine has hierarchical structure or hidden variables, then it is singular
MISC	for singular learning machines, the log likelihood  function can not be approximated by any quadratic form of the parameter, with the result that the conventional relationship between generalization errors and  training errors does not hold either for the maximum likelihood method  citation   citation  citation  or  bayes estimation  citation
MISC	singularities strongly affect generalization performances  citation  and learning dynamics  citation
MISC	in regular statistical models,  symbol ,  where  symbol  is the dimension of the parameter space, whereas in singular statistical models,  symbol   depends strongly on the learning machine, the true distribution, and the  a priori  probability distribution
MISC	in practical applications, the true distribution is often unknown, hence it has been difficult to estimate the generalization error from the training error
MISC	to estimate the generalization error when we do not have any information about the true distribution, we need a general formula which holds independently of singularities
MISC	these equations assert that the increased error from training to  generalization is in proportion to  the difference between the bayes and gibbs training errors
MISC	it should be emphasized that these formulas hold for any true distribution, any learning machine,  any  a priori  probability distribution, and any singularities, therefore they reflect the universal laws of statistical estimation
OWNX	in section 3,  we propose widely applicable information criteria  and show how to apply them to statistical estimation
OWNX	in section 4, we prove the main results in the mathematically rigorous way
MISC	the proofs of lemmas are quite technical hence they are presented in appendix
MISC	markov random fields are used to model high dimensional distributions in a number of applied areas
MISC	much recent interest has been devoted to the reconstruction of the dependency structure from independent samples from the markov random fields
OWNX	we show that under mild non-degeneracy conditions it reconstructs the generating graph with high probability using  symbol  samples where  symbol  depend on the local interactions
OWNX	our results are optimal as a function of  symbol  up to a multiplicative constant depending on  symbol  and the strength of the local interactions
OWNX	our results seem to be the first results for general models that guarantee that  the  generating model is reconstructed
OWNX	furthermore, we provide explicit  symbol  running time bound
MISC	in cases where the measure on the graph has correlation decay, the running time is  symbol  for all fixed  symbol
OWNX	we also discuss the effect of observing noisy samples and show that as long as the noise level is low, our algorithm is effective
MISC	on the other hand, we construct an example where large noise implies non-identifiability even for generic noise and interactions
OWNX	finally, we briefly show that in some simple cases, models with hidden nodes can also be recovered
AIMX	in this paper we consider the problem of reconstructing the graph structure of a markov random field from independent and identically distributed samples
MISC	markov random fields (mrf) provide a very general framework for defining high dimensional distributions and the reconstruction of the mrf from observations has attracted much recent interest, in particular in biology, see eg ~ citation  and a list of related references~ citation
OWNX	we consider the problem of choosing a density estimate from a set of distributions~ symbol , minimizing the  symbol -distance to an unknown distribution ( citation )
MISC	the scheff\'e tournament estimate requires fewer computations than the minimum distance estimate, but has strictly weaker guarantees than the latter
OWNX	we focus on the computational aspect of density estimation
OWNX	we present two algorithms, both with the same guarantee as the minimum distance estimate
OWNX	we also give examples showing that the guarantees of the algorithms cannot be improved and explore randomized algorithms for density estimation
OWNX	we study the following density estimation problem considered in~ citation
OWNX	given a finite class  symbol  of distributions, our objective is to output  symbol  such that the error  symbol  is minimized
MISC	the use of the  symbol -norm is well justified by it has many useful properties, for example, scale invariance and the fact that approximate identification of a distribution in the  symbol -norm gives an estimate for the probability of every event
MISC	it is not obvious how to define the second parameter---the error of  symbol  with respect to  symbol
OWNX	we follow the definition of~ citation , which is inspired by~ citation  (see section~ for a precise definition)
MISC	the minimum distance estimate, defined by yatracos~ citation , is a special case of the minimum distance principle, formalized by wolfowitz in~ citation
OWNX	our main contribution are two procedures for selecting an estimate from  symbol , both of which have the same guarantees as the minimum distance estimate, but are computationally more efficient
MISC	the first has a quadratic (in  symbol ) cost, matching the cost of the scheff\'e tournament winner algorithm
MISC	the second one is even faster, using  linearly  many (in  symbol ) computations (after preprocessing  symbol )
OWNX	in section~ we give the required definitions and introduce the notion of a test-function (a variant of scheff\'e set)
OWNX	then, in section~, we restate the previous density estimation algorithms (scheff\'e tournament winner and the minimum distance estimate) using test-functions
OWNX	next, in section~, we present our algorithms
OWNX	the second one, which we call ``efficient minimum loss-weight estimate,'' has only  linear  computational cost after preprocessing  symbol
OWNX	in section~ we explore randomized density estimation algorithms
OWNX	in the final section~, we give examples showing tightness of the theorems stated in the previous sections
MISC	it is argued that emotions are not homogenous concerning their role in decision making  but that four distinct functions can be distinguished concerning emotional phenomena
MISC	one function is to provide information about pleasure and pain for preference construction  a second function is to enable rapid choices under time pressure  a third function is to focus attention on relevant aspects of a decision problem  and a fourth function is to generate commitment concerning morally and socially significant decisions
OWNX	we argue that a precise conceptualization of emotional phenomena is required to advance our understanding of the complex role of emotions in decision making
MISC	the study of emotions in the context of decision making  beginning more than twenty years ago  citation   has received increasing attention over the past decade  citation
MISC	there is  however  little consensus in the literature on what is actually meant by emotion or affect
OWNX	first  we briefly sketch two approaches with a similar objective  the classification of emotions by loewenstein and lerner  citation   and the functional typology proposed by peters  citation
OWNX	we will then discuss some common assumptions about emotions which we believe have confused the understanding of the role of emotion in decision making
MISC	in particular  i focus on aspects of human language that enable successful co-ordination around shared tasks that involve the management of uncertainty by a group
MISC	i distinguish between performative action-oriented and constative description-oriented aspects of human communication  and argue that the human logical vocabulary of conditionals  quantifiers and probability expressions often conveys pragmatic signals that implicitly encourage or discourage a course of action that is under discussion
MISC	i review some studies that illustrate this perspective by highlighting the role of emotional undertone in risk communication and management  and show how it differs from existing models of risk communication and decision-making
MISC	taking the view that human language evolved first as a means of social influence  and only second as a means of describing and representing the world can help understand why human logical language - far from containing disinterested and dispassionate devices for describing reality - is essentially argumentative in structure and function  citation
MISC	thus the conditionals  quantifiers and probability expressions that humans naturally use when making plans to deal with uncertainty will implicitly signal a speaker's attitude to the action under question  for example  whether he wishes to encourage or discourage it
MISC	i argue that human communication emerges out of the expression of emotion  which primarily serves to influence the behaviour of conspecifics  citation
MISC	the emotional tone inherent to risk communication will influence others with respect to avoiding dangers and planning to take advantage of opportunities
MISC	framing and polarity effects which focus the hearer's attention either on the positive or the negative aspects of a question  citation  are pervasive in discussions about decisions  because actions can either be taken or not taken
MISC	there is no middle ground here  and one must therefore decide whether to flee or not to flee in the face of threat  to buy or not to buy a share  to recruit or not to recruit a candidate
MISC	due to this lack of middle ground  it is hard if not impossible to give completely disinterested and dispassionate advice about decisions  as the normal use of the human logical vocabulary leads us to argue implicitly either for or against taking the action in question
MISC	this pragmatic view of risk communication is at variance with that which would emerge from the view that language is a purely representational system
MISC	in the representational view  the function of an expert such as a doctor  a banker might be to assemble the relevant facts and present them in an objective way to the client  so that the client could make an informed decision to take a treatment  to make an investment
MISC	an intrapersonal externality exists when an individual's decisions affect the outcomes of her future decisions
MISC	it can result in decreasing or increasing average returns to the rate of consumption  as occurs in addiction or exercise
MISC	experimentation using the harvard game  which models intrapersonal externalities  has found differences in decision making between drug users and control subjects  leading to the argument that these externalities influence the course of illicit drug use
MISC	nevertheless  it is unclear how participants who behave optimally conceptualise the problem
MISC	those who demonstrated optimal performance exhibited both a pattern of correct responses and systematic errors to questions about the payoff schedules
MISC	the pattern suggested that they learned explicit knowledge of the change in reinforcement on a trail-by-trial basis
MISC	we also found no evidence of choice differences between participants who were given a guaranteed payment and participants who were paid contingent on their performance  but those given a guaranteed payment were able to report more contingency knowledge as the experiment progressed  suggesting that they explored more rather than settling into a routine
MISC	experiment  number  showed that using a fixed inter-trial interval did not change the results
MISC	experiments have long suggested that when humans make decisions they sometimes ignore even major consequences
MISC	in some situations  consequences are systematically ignored
MISC	one such situation is that of intrapersonal externalities  citation   where changes to the utility of options available to the future self are not taken into account when making a decision  in the same way that externalities in economics refer to situations in which consequences to others are not taken into account when individuals make decisions
MISC	in an experiment reported by herrnstein and colleagues  citation   participants were presented with a repeated binary choice task using payoff schedules similar to those shown in figure  number 
MISC	the payoff from each choice was determined by the proportion of the previous ten choices that was allocated to each option  where choosing the optimal long-term option would lead to a lower immediate payoff but would slightly increase the payoff from both options over each of the next ten trials  leading to a higher overall payoff
MISC	conversely  choosing the optimal short-term option would lead to a higher immediate payoff but would decrease the payoff over the next ten trials  relative to the optimal option
MISC	consistently choosing the long-term option ultimately leads to the highest payoff  although on any single trial the short-term option would give the greatest number of points
MISC	the authors found that most participants did not learn to optimise their behaviour  choosing instead the option with the greatest short-term payoff
MISC	herrnstein and vaughan  citation  suggested that choices are made according to the principle of melioration  in which the global rate of reinforcement is ignored
MISC	it is not new to postulate that addicts do not fully take into account internalities  although past models have generally used hyperbolic time discounting as the theoretical reason for inconsistent preferences  citation
MISC	further evidence for the link between intrapersonal externalities and addictions has come from neuropsychological research  which found that the level of prefrontal brain activity is associated with performance in the task  citation
MISC	this is the same area that is implicated in studies using the iowa gambling task  citation   which is related to abuse of various substances  including alcohol and stimulants  citation
MISC	this suggests that intervention at this behavioural level could be effective in reducing addictive behaviour if a method were found to improve decisions on tasks involving intrapersonal externalities
MISC	warry  remington and sonuga-barke  citation  attempted to reduce the motivation for participants to choose sub-optimally by reducing the immediate differential between the two options
MISC	herrnstein and colleagues  citation  found that choices were only briefly improved by the hint but soon returned to sub-optimal levels
MISC	kudadjie-gyamfi and rachlin  citation  provided a similar hint  but found no corresponding improvement at all
MISC	nevertheless  tunney and shanks  citation  showed that participants could overcome sub-optimal behaviour  as long as they were given regular feedback about how their behaviour compared to the optimal outcome  and they were given around  number   number  trials to learn the schedules
MISC	this suggests that suboptimal choices in the harvard game are not a stable decision-making bias  but rather due to a failure to fully learn the payoff schedules
MISC	normally in experiments studying intrapersonal externalities participants' choices either affect the number of points gained  citation  or the number of choices remaining until the end of the experiment  citation
MISC	this allowed the two outcomes from each decision to be separated so that the immediate effects were visible through the number of points gained on each trial  and the number of choices remaining until the end of the experiment decreased at differing rates depending upon the participant's history of choices
MISC	in other words  choosing myopically led to earning high payoffs through the experiment  but ultimately the experiment ended prematurely and the participant lost the opportunity to earn further payoffs
MISC	separating the consequences from each decision made the outcomes of each decision more easily discernible  and so participants learned to choose optimally much earlier than in previous experiments
MISC	this also hints that suboptimal behaviour in the task is a failure to fully understand the payoff schedules
MISC	in nature the outcomes from choices that are made may not be so easily divided into separate simple categories
MISC	one process could be the result of conscious insight into the payoff schedules that participants are able to report
MISC	this mirrors research into the iowa gambling task which found that participants were able to explicitly report their understanding of the task  citation
MISC	the present experiments attempted to test explicit knowledge of the payoff schedules  to find out what participants who behave optimally are able to report about the payoff schedules
MISC	the experiments tested participants' knowledge by asking a series of questions designed to cover every scenario in the task
MISC	the experiments also tested whether making participants' payment contingent on the number of points that they gained during the task had an effect on their choices
MISC	particularly in the economics literature it is seen as crucial to incentivize participants in this way  citation
MISC	participants in the contingent condition were paid based on the number of points they earned  whereas those in the certain condition were paid a fixed amount
MISC	it is possible that giving points-contingent payments could cause participants to have more motivation and thus gain more points  or that participants would not explore as fully as they would otherwise and so would settle on a suboptimal strategy leading to fewer points  citation
MISC	if  however  it is not a motivation failure that leads to poor performance on experiments using intrapersonal externalities  but rather the cognitive failure to understand the payoff schedules  then a difference might not be expected
MISC	according to the time-saving bias  drivers underestimate the time saved when increasing from a low speed and overestimate the time saved when increasing from a relatively high speed
MISC	previous research used a specific type of task - drivers were asked to estimate time saved when increasing speed and to give a numeric response - to show this
MISC	study  number  found that drivers committed the time-saving bias when asked to estimate a the time saved when increasing speed or b the distance that can be completed at a given time when increasing speed or c the speed required to complete a given distance in decreasing times
MISC	study  number  showed no major differences in estimations of time saved compared to estimations of the remaining journey time and also between responses given on a numeric scale versus a visual analog scale
MISC	study  number  tested two possible explanations for the time-saving bias  a proportion heuristic and a differences heuristic
MISC	if you need to complete a  number  km journey  how much time would it take at a mean speed of  number  kph
MISC	most people would find it easy to answer such a question -  number  km at  number  kph takes half an hour or  number  minutes
MISC	but what if you wanted to increase speed in order to reduce journey time
MISC	how much time would you save if you increase your speed to  number  kph or to  number  or  number  kph
MISC	many people consistently give the wrong answers to these questions
MISC	several studies have shown that people underestimate the time saved when increasing from a relatively low speed and overestimate the time saved when increasing from a relatively high speed  citation
MISC	participants drank either regular root beer or sugar-free diet root beer  before working on a probability-learning task in which they tried to predict which of two events  would occur on each of  number  trials
MISC	one event e number  randomly occurred on  number  trials   the other e number  on  number 
MISC	in each of the last two blocks of  number  trials  the regular group matched prediction and event frequencies
MISC	after the task  participants were asked to write down rules they used for  responding
MISC	participants also took longer to advance after incorrect predictions and before predicting e number   reflecting time for revising and consulting rules
MISC	these results support the hypothesis that an effortful controlled process of  normative rule-generation produces matching in probability-learning experiments   and that this process is a function of glucose availability
MISC	in two-choice probability learning pl experiments  one event e number  has a better chance of occurring than the other e number   and event likelihoods are independent of responses
MISC	although participants could maximize hits by exclusively predicting e number   they tend to approximately match prediction frequencies with outcome probabilities for many trials  citation
MISC	for example  if e number  occurs on  number  percent  of trials and e number  occurs on the other  number  percent  of trials  people usually predict e number  on about  number  percent  of their choices for hundreds of trials  citation
MISC	this probability-matching pm behavior is suboptimal because it produces hits on only  number  percent  of trials   number  x  number    number  x  number  instead of the maximal  number  percent  hit rate from always predicting e number 
MISC	the impact of default options on choice is a reliable  well-established behavioral finding
MISC	however  several different effects may lend to choosing defaults in an often indistinguishable manner  including loss aversion  inattention  information leakage  and transaction costs associated with switching
MISC	the default pull shapes what a decision maker prefers by causing her to consider whether she prefers the default
OWNX	we demonstrate default pull effects using a simple decision making task that strips away many of the usual reasons that defaults could affect choices  and we show that defaults can have substantial effects on choice  even when the default itself was not chosen
MISC	perhaps one of the most well-established behavioral decision making effects is the effect of default options on choice
MISC	people choose options presented as defaults more often than they otherwise would  even for important decisions that would seem to require careful thought  such as choosing health care or retirement plans  citation
MISC	mere inattention could lead some decision makers to retain a default if action is required only when opting out of the default
MISC	loss-averse decision makers may not want to give up the default because it feels like a loss that is more painful than gaining a different option is pleasurable  citation
MISC	the fact that someone has set an option as a default can create an  information leakage   citation  from which people might infer normative reasons for choosing the default
MISC	finally  people may choose defaults when there are sufficient transaction costs of money or time in choosing an alternative
MISC	the default pull is the effect that default options have on decision makers' uncertainty about their own preferences
MISC	this process provides a link between how defaults influence choices and how anchors influence judgments  citation
MISC	in this way  the default pull effect is a kind of constructed preference  citation   wherein the manner in which preference is elicited influences what one's preferences are
MISC	to study the default pull  we use a motivated experimental choice that strips away many of the common reasons why defaults might work  a modified presentation of a dictator game  citation  in which whatever option is on the top of a list of allocations is left selected on a computer interface  ostensibly unintentionally see figure  number 
MISC	this subtle default option substantially affects players' choices  different defaults can change the average amount given by  number  percent  of the total endowment
OWNX	before we describe the specifics of the task  we briefly review the literature on default biases  and then formally define the default pull
OWNX	 waste not want not  expresses our culture's aversion to waste
MISC	 i could have gotten the same thing for less  is a sentiment that can diminish pleasure in a transaction
MISC	we study people's willingness to  pay  to avoid this spoiler
MISC	in one scenario  participants imagined they were looking for a rental apartment  and had bought a subscription to an apartment listing
MISC	if a cheaper subscription had been declined  respondents preferred not to discover post hoc that it would have sufficed
MISC	specifically  they preferred ending their quest for the ideal apartment after seeing more  rather than fewer  apartments  so that the length of the search exceeds that available within the cheaper subscription
OWNX	other scenarios produced similar results
MISC	we conclude that people may sometimes prefer to be wasteful in order to avoid feeling wasteful
MISC	she had just rented a perfect little apartment  advertised on a campus bulletin board
MISC	now i feel like a freier  a yiddish word  roughly meaning patsy  sucker  or pushover
MISC	spending more money than necessary is regarded as wasteful
MISC	when not intentional  and easily avoidable  it can make one feel like a freier
MISC	admittedly  sometimes people overspend deliberately
MISC	others flaunt their disregard for money by lighting up cigars with   number  bills
MISC	people also choose to be generous  giving expensive gifts  throwing elaborate parties  tipping ostentatiously  etc
MISC	extravagance is not to be equated with waste
MISC	but when actions are self-defined as wasteful  the feeling of wastefulness can be as aversive  if not more  than the waste itself
MISC	mental accounting  citation  provides a useful framework for understanding waste
MISC	if you want a new pair of jeans    number  is wasteful
MISC	but if you want prada jeans    number  may be a bargain
MISC	to please your hosts  a   number  wine may be adequate
MISC	but to impress them  you should lay out more
MISC	when you open a mental account  and enter a debit  you can judge for yourself whether the resulting outcome was  worth it 
MISC	but mental accounting does not explain why the feeling of waste is so aversive
MISC	arkes  an expert on the psychology of waste  citation   has defined waste in two ways
MISC	first  as mentioned above  a person is said to be wasteful if she  spends more money on an item than is necessary 
MISC	second  the other side of waste is to  utilize the item that has been purchased  insufficiently  citation
MISC	arkes showed  moreover  that even  to avoid the appearance of wastefulness  italics ours  people may be motivated to make choices that compromise their own self-interest  citation  
MISC	appearing to have spent too much hurts the ego
MISC	people may willingly overpay in economic currencies to reduce psychological costs
MISC	however  losses that are not one's  own fault  due  e g   to theft  accident  or market behavior are not accompanied by this second-order pain
MISC	thus  people may also prefer to tolerate additional expenditures of time  effort  pain  discomfort  etc
MISC	  if only to avoid the psychological costs of feeling that they wasted their money
MISC	study  number  establishes the phenomenon  namely that  in order to avoid feeling that money was wasted people prefer an outcome that delivers the same result  but requires greater expenditure of effort  time or discomfort  and is therefore dominated
MISC	study  number  extends the results by introducing new dependent variables and manipulating the proximity of the protagonist
OWNX	we employed simple gambles to investigate information processing in relation to the compatibility effect
MISC	subjects should be more likely to engage in a deliberative thinking strategy when completing a pricing task rather than a rating task
OWNX	we used eye-tracking methodology to measure information acquisition and processing in order to test the above hypothesis as well as to show that losses and alternatives with uncertain outcomes are more likely than gains and alternatives with sure outcomes to be processed through a deliberative thinking process
MISC	additionally  the number of fixations increased as the gamble outcome became increasingly negative and when the outcome was uncertain vs sure
MISC	both psychologists and economists have traditionally been interested in understanding how people make decisions under uncertainty and how they deal with economic risks
MISC	however  whereas the latter have conventionally been more concerned with delineating the conditions under which decisions follow rational norms and expectations  citation   psychologists have focused on analyzing the cognitive processes underlying decisions and preferences  citation
MISC	each pair of gambles included one gamble that offered a large payoff but with low probability labeled  -bet and another gamble that offered a small payoff but with high probability labeled p-bet
MISC	in this way it was possible to assess which dimension was more influential in each task and to determine whether their effects on people's preferences were big enough to induce preference reversals
MISC	consistent with the above reasoning  results showed that   many people chose the p-bet because it offered the highest chance to win  but then placed a higher selling price on the  -bet  which offered the possibility of winning a larger amount of money
MISC	research on preference reversals suggests that this phenomenon is mainly induced by an overpricing of the  -bet in the pricing condition when this gamble offers a larger payoff compared with the p-bet  citation
MISC	this result has been replicated many times  citation   no doubt because it offers a particular challenge for economic theories of choice which assume stable preferences
MISC	several explanations have been suggested to account for preference reversals like these  citation   of which the compatibility effect is probably the most prominent  citation
MISC	compatibility effects between task and response have been shown in several research domains in cognitive psychology  citation
MISC	tversky  sattath and slovic  citation  suggested a similar explanation to account for the different degree of attention given to specific attributes depending on the method used to elicit preferences
MISC	in particular  these authors postulated that  when attributes are compatible with the response scale  they are assigned greater weight because they are most easily mapped onto the response
MISC	for instance  when subjects are asked to set a price for a gamble this task is compatible with the information about the gamble payoff  which is also expressed in monetary values e g   dollars
MISC	conversely  when the task requires a choice the payoff information is not easily mapped onto the response anymore and loses some of its salience
MISC	in fact  slovic  griffin  and tversky  citation  could show that using non-monetary outcomes attenuates preference reversals when no compatibility between the pricing task and the outcome attribute was possible
MISC	an assumption of the compatibility effect is that response modes compatible with specific characteristics of the options e g   payoffs draw attention to them
MISC	attentional deployment to these characteristics  in turn  increases the weight given to them in the construction of preferences  citation
MISC	research on attentional processes underlying choices and preference reversals supports the role of attention in the compatibility effect  citation
MISC	using the mouselab computer-based process-tracing system  schkade and johnson were able to force subjects to view components of each gamble sequentially one at a time
MISC	results showed that the percentage of time spent looking at payoffs was significantly greater in a pricing task than in a rating task  therefore supporting the hypothesis that people attend to information differently depending on the answer they are required to provide
MISC	the process tracing methodology used by schkade and johnson allowed them to considerably improve the understanding of the processes behind the compatibility effect
MISC	ratings of attractiveness required less time than the generation of a price
MISC	additionally  in the pricing task  the information search pattern was significantly more dimensional than in the ratings task transitions between two outcomes or two probabilities within the same gamble as opposed to transitions between a payoff and its probability
MISC	when generating a price  subjects spent one third of the time adjusting their evaluation on the response scale  whereas in the rating task they spent the same amount of time to generate the response but adjusted the position of the pointer on the scale less often
MISC	several complementary methodologies to study information processing from a physiological perspective have recently proven useful to investigate how people make decisions  including event related potentials  citation   and fmri  citation
MISC	physiological measures have also been applied to investigate intuitive and deliberative thinking systems
MISC	furthermore  horstmann  ahlgrimm  and  glockner  citation  used eye-tracking methodology to analyze people's information processing when instructed to decide deliberatively or intuitively
OWNX	specifically  our goal is to show that  number  compatibility effects are also present when using simple gambles in both gain frame and loss frame  and  number  we intended to draw a connection between the compatibility effect and dual process theories  citation
MISC	in particular  setting a price seems to entail more fine-tuned adjustments once an initial evaluation is established
MISC	this dynamic of adjustments could hint at a deliberative type of processing activated by the search for the most advantageous balance between costs the price paid and benefits the amount of the possible gain
OWNX	by deliberative processing we mean a strategy characterized by a conscious and detailed evaluation of the pros and cons of a specific gamble
MISC	in contrast  a holistic strategy is based on a more general  less detailed and less conscious evaluation of the gamble
OWNX	therefore  we test the hypothesis that the pricing task requires more deliberative information processing with a conscious process of comparison between different pieces of information
MISC	this reasoning is consistent with the fact that ratings of attractiveness are also used as a measure of affective reactions  citation  and should be more influenced by an intuitive thinking strategy
MISC	specifying a price  on the other hand  should be mainly based on the conscious effort of setting the correct price
MISC	hypothesis  number a  subjects should exert more cognitive effort in terms of eye fixation count when providing a price than when providing ratings of attractiveness  since the pricing task should activate a more deliberative thinking strategy than the rating task
MISC	hypothesis  number b  subjects should give the payoff information more weight than the respective probabilities when providing a price than when providing ratings of attractiveness
MISC	in other words  subjects should fixate prices more often than the respective probabilities when providing a price than when providing ratings of attractiveness
OWNX	we also expect to find a set of additional results based on the type of alternatives simple gambles that we employ in our study
MISC	for instance  subjects should exert more cognitive effort when the amount to be lost increases in comparison to an increase in the amount to be won
MISC	this is consistent with research on the effects of gain vs loss framing on cognitive processes  which has demonstrated that people exhibit more thorough evaluations and more effortful cognitive analysis when faced with potential losses  citation
MISC	additionally  research on loss aversion shows that losses loom larger than gains  citation  and typically carry more weight in decisions
MISC	subjects should be more careful in judging a loss than a gain  whose relevance is psychologically less intense
MISC	this hypothesis is also consistent with previous literature describing a negativity bias  citation
MISC	baumeister et al concluded that it is adaptive for individuals to mobilize their attention and resources toward negative information
MISC	this is in line with previous work demonstrating that emotions can drive attentional processes  citation
OWNX	hypothesis  number   subjects should exert more cognitive effort in terms of eye fixation count as the outcome becomes increasingly negative
MISC	previous research demonstrated that sure outcomes have a special status in people's mind
OWNX	starting from this evidence  we hypothesized that people should process alternatives with sure outcomes and alternatives with uncertain outcomes differently
MISC	in particular  subjects should exhibit more deliberative processing characteristics e g   fixate on more information when presented with an uncertain outcome rather than a sure one  since uncertainty should make it more difficult to attach a specific value to the gamble
MISC	alternatives whose outcomes are impossible to attain should be processed more easily and with less effort than alternatives whose outcomes are very unlikely but not impossible
MISC	again  subjects should exhibit more deliberative processing characteristics when they evaluate an alternative whose outcomes are almost impossible because uncertainty makes its value harder to judge
MISC	therefore  the current study will provide additional evidence about the processes behind the certainty effect  citation  and extend these findings to the lower end of the probability scale
MISC	hypothesis  number a  more information should be attended to  in terms of overall eye fixation count  when subjects evaluate alternatives with uncertain outcomes e g    number  percent  chance to either gain or lose rather than alternatives with sure outcomes  number  percent   because uncertainty should contribute to making an alternative's overall value more difficult to judge
MISC	hypothesis  number b  similarly  the evaluation of alternatives offering an impossible outcome  number  percent  should induce subjects to attend to less information in terms of overall fixation count than the evaluation of alternatives offering outcomes that are almost impossible e g   a  number  percent  chance of either gain or lose
OWNX	finally  besides the effects of the different tasks on cognitive effort and attentional mechanisms  we also expect to find evidence for the compatibility effect in the behavioral data i e   in the evaluation of gambles
MISC	as demonstrated by prior research  citation   valuations should be more influenced by changes in outcome value i e   amounts to be won or lost when these valuations are in form of a price
MISC	conversely  valuations should be more influenced by changes in outcome percentage i e   the chances of winning or losing when these valuations are in form of an attractiveness rating
MISC	additionally  the cognitive processes activated by different tasks i e   pricing versus rating and by the different types of outcomes sure versus uncertain should also affect how alternatives are evaluated
MISC	if people attend more to payoffs in the wtp-task  then they should be less sensitive to the difference between sure and uncertain outcomes  since less attention is deployed to the processing of probabilities
MISC	however  such diminished sensitivity to the difference between sure and uncertain outcomes should not arise in the rating task since  in this case  people do not attend more to payoffs than probabilities
OWNX	we derive this hypothesis directly from the compatibility effect
MISC	since the response mode has an effect on which piece of information is weighed more highly  people's appreciation of the difference between alternatives with sure and uncertain outcomes should depend on the method used to elicit preferences
MISC	because of the compatibility effect  such difference should be more relevant when subjects provide ratings of attractiveness rather than when they specify a price
OWNX	we hypothesized that people should provide higher attractiveness ratings for a  number  percent  gain compared to a  number  percent  gain and for a  number  percent  gain compared with a  number  percent  gain
MISC	similarly  subjects should provide higher attractiveness ratings for a  number  percent  loss compared with a  number  percent  loss and for a  number  percent  loss compared with a  number  percent  loss
MISC	hypothesis  number b  since rating and pricing should induce people to attend to the outcomes differently  alternatives with sure and uncertain outcomes will be evaluated differently when people are asked to rate attractiveness  but not when they are asked to set a price
MISC	in summary  the main goal of this study is to apply the eye-tracking methodology to the investigation of the compatibility effect as well as to extend the analysis of this effect by linking it to dual-process theories of decision making  citation
OWNX	further  we hypothesize that subjects should exert more cognitive effort with increasing losses hypothesis  number 
MISC	decision research in psychology has traditionally been influenced by the homo oeconomicus metaphor with its emphasis on normative models and deviations from the predictions of those models
MISC	in contrast  the principal metaphor of cognitive psychology conceptualizes humans as 'information processors'  employing processes of perception  memory  categorization  problem solving and so on
MISC	a wide range of models and metaphors has been proposed to explain and describe 'information processing' and many models have been applied to decision making in ingenious ways
OWNX	we end by discussing the challenges posed by the contrasting and sometimes incompatible assumptions of the models and metaphors
MISC	the traditional approach to the study of judgment and decision making jdm is to compare a judgment or a decision which can be considered as a judgment about what to do  citation  to a standard or  benchmark
MISC	normative models which provide these standards are valuable because their clear sets of rules or axioms  such as those derived from economics expected utility theory and mathematics probability theory can be used to test predictions about human behavior
MISC	when behavior deviates from the predictions of normative models - i e   biases are observed - attempts can be made to ascertain why and  often  techniques for overcoming such biases can be prescribed
MISC	this approach with its focus on deviations from normative models contrasts the ideal of a homo oeconomicus with the apparent reality of a cognitive miser or even loser and has been enormously influential and useful
MISC	however  it has not been without its critics  citation
MISC	this  disconnection  is a great pity given that many of the issues at the core of understanding human judgment and decision making are  necessarily  central to the wider goal of understanding human cognition
MISC	in the  number  years since the seminal attempt by john payne  citation  to make jdm research  more cognitive  a wide range of approaches from cognitive psychology has been applied to this question
AIMX	this paper is structured as follows  we begin with a brief introduction  citation  which serves to highlight the things we know about cognition that should be incorporated into models of multi-attribute judgment  we then discuss briefly how these aspects are addressed in some of the models considered by contributors to the special issue
MISC	this collection of models  however  cannot simply be viewed as complementary accounts since they sometimes conflict with respect to fundamental assumptions
MISC	a type of emergency decision-making which has not received research attention is the police search for a lost person in a rural or wilderness area
MISC	for many such incidents  decisions concerning where to search for the lost subject are made by a planning team  each member of which assigns probabilities to the various hypotheses about where the subject might be located  including the residual hypothesis that the subject is somewhere else entirely  that is  outside of the designated search area
OWNX	it was hypothesized  according to support theory  citation   that subjects who first considered the five possible scenarios accounting for how the subject could have left the search area-i e   unpacked the residual hypothesis-would subsequently increase their probability estimate of the global hypothesis that the missing subject was not in the designated search area  compared to those subjects who unpacked the focal hypothesis
MISC	this hypothesis was confirmed
OWNX	we also found considerable evidence for subadditivity  as most subjects estimated higher summed probabilities for the individual scenarios accounting for the focal and residual hypotheses  respectively
MISC	the past two decades have seen a growing interest in the manner in which emergency responders make decisions in the field
MISC	for example  klein  citation  and his colleagues have studied the decision-making processes of various types of emergency managers  such as fire commanders  who are required to initiate an appropriate response to their respective emergencies as early in their incidents as possible
MISC	these researchers have found that the emergency managers whom they studied rarely consider alternative options simultaneously in an analytic fashion
MISC	the expertise of emergency managers  according to klein  citation   is reflected in their ability to quickly categorize an emergency according to their experience  and to imagine a scenario in which a particular course of action toward resolving the emergency could be successfully implemented
MISC	one type of emergency response not studied by klein and his associates is the police search for a person lost in a large scale rural or wilderness area  a topic which has only recently become a focus of research by behavioral scientists  citation
MISC	a variety of people become the targets of such searches  including hunters  hikers  anglers  and other outdoor enthusiasts  as well as children who wander away from camp or rural homes  and elderly people suffering from senile dementia  citation
MISC	organized searches for lost people usually come under the authority of public safety personnel such as county sheriffs  regional or state police officers  conservation officers  or park rangers
MISC	in north america  the search management system prescribed by the national association for search and rescue is nearly universally recognized as the  best practice  model for organizing a lost person incident  citation   and is itself an application of the incident command system endorsed by the u s federal emergency management agency for managing all emergency incidents  citation
MISC	a lost person incident begins with a decision that the subject of a missing person report may be spatially disoriented in a large rural environment  such as a forested area
MISC	such incidents are usually considered to be highly urgent  as factors related to health  age  weather  or natural hazards may threaten the subject's safety
MISC	upon arrival at the scene  the incident commander-in consultation with other members of the search management team-will set in motion routinized efforts to quickly locate the missing subject  such as tasking searchers or canine teams to track the missing person from the  place last seen  pls
MISC	as well  efforts to confine the subject to the search locale will usually be implemented  such as setting up trail blocks some distance away from the pls
OWNX	after these first steps are initiated  however  the incident commander will confer with the search management team in a concerted planning session  which is strikingly unlike the  satisficing  process described by klein
OWNX	during these discussions  the search and rescue planning team makes the search tractable by parsing the environment and developing scenarios of what likely happened to the lost person
OWNX	thereafter  search management consists largely of iterative task assignments in which individuals or teams are dispatched to check these possibilities
MISC	the methodology is bayesian  the planning team will revise its priorities on the basis of field reports from the search teams  along with clues  eyewitness reports  and similar evidence uncovered during search activities  citation
MISC	as well  the methodology involves assigning some nontrivial probability to the  rest of the world  row  that is  all of the area outside of the designated search area  which will likely not be searched during that operational period  citation
MISC	the individual probability judgments are then combined and averaged  yielding a planning poa that reflects the consensual probabilities that the subject may be located within each segment as well as the row
MISC	as mentioned in the quote above  the methodology is bayesian  in that the initial subjective probabilities are recomputed according to bayes theorem as segments are searched and the lost person is not located see appendix a
MISC	indeed  search coordinators are advised to monitor the poa of the  rest of the world   particularly with respect to decisions about expanding the search  which is accomplished by partialing out new segments formerly outside of the designated search area  citation
MISC	hutchins applied the term  distributed cognition  to describe such mutual and complementary efforts of individual specialists using a host of cognitive  artifacts  such as maps  charts  electronic instruments  and computers
MISC	similarly  fischhoff and johnson  citation  used the term  distributed decision-making  to refer specifically to command-and-control type operations in which decisions are made by two or more individuals
MISC	it is assumed that such judgments are based on the planners' sar experience and acquired expertise  plus reference to actuarial data tabulated from previous lost person incidents  such as how far from the pls various types of lost people tend to travel before being located  citation
MISC	unfortunately  much research on decision processes would appear to cast doubt on the ability of planners to make valid probability judgments  as the ability to render unbiased assessments of probability for uncertain events has been challenged by tversky  and  koehler's  citation  support theory  citation
MISC	for example  people estimate significantly higher chances of dying from heart disease  cancer  or other natural causes  than simply from any natural cause  citation
MISC	this unpacking effect is said to occur whenever people are asked to consider the disjoint components of an uncertain event that is  various possibilities that can cause the event rather than merely the event itself
MISC	various explanations for unpacking have been proposed  including the tendency for an explicit inclusion of specific causes of an effect to increase confidence in that cause  citation   or to remind people of possibilities they might have overlooked  citation
MISC	a side effect of unpacking is subadditivity
MISC	however  unpacking the event to be judged e g   homicide  fatal accident  drowning not only leads to higher estimates of probability  but frequently in total probabilities greater than  number  percent   citation
MISC	another important consideration in support theory pertains to those occasions when people judge the relative probabilities of two or more mutually exclusive hypotheses
MISC	for example  if there are three suspects in a crime  a  b  and c  the hypothesis that a is the culprit and the associated probability that a did it is termed the focal hypothesis  while the possibility that someone other than a is guilty b  c  or some unknown x is called the residual hypothesis
MISC	in this case  the set of possibilities-either a or not-a symbolized as   x number  -is discrete that is  either hypothesis must necessarily be true
MISC	when comparing the relative probabilities of the focal and residual hypotheses  support for the former s a  will decrease the estimated probability for the latter s   x number     as seen in the formula    where pa   x number   refers to the probability that a rather than   x number   is true
OWNX	bringing the discussion back to the search and rescue planning task  we can describe the hypothesis that the missing subject is in the designated search area as the focal hypothesis  while the possibility that he or she is somewhere else-the row-as the residual hypothesis
OWNX	at this point  we can begin to form our own hypotheses as to why this methodology sometimes fails
MISC	according to hill  citation   the single most common reason why a lost person is not found in a reasonable period of time is that the victim had traveled out of the designated search area and that search planners had not extended the search into the row soon enough
MISC	a similar problem is apparently encountered by the u s coast guard in their conduct of maritime sar  such as searching for missing vessels at sea
MISC	it is possible  if not indeed likely  that planners in these emergency situations are experiencing unpacking effects which tend to keep them unreasonably  locked  to their focal hypotheses
MISC	for example  in the application of the bayesian formula as applied to sar see appendix a  poa's are updated each time a segment is searched and the subject is not found
MISC	with each iteration  the poa of the row grows slightly larger
MISC	combining meaning  memory  and development  the perennially popular topic of intuition can be approached in a new way
MISC	fuzzy-trace theory integrates these topics by distinguishing between meaning-based gist representations  which support fuzzy yet advanced intuition  and superficial verbatim representations of information  which support precise analysis
MISC	here  i review the counterintuitive findings that led to the development of the theory and its most recent extensions to the neuroscience of risky decision making
MISC	these findings include memory interference worse verbatim memory is associated with better reasoning  nonnumerical framing framing effects increase when numbers are deleted from decision problems  developmental decreases in gray matter and increases in brain connectivity  developmental reversals in memory  judgment  and decision making heuristics and biases based on gist increase from childhood to adulthood  challenging conceptions of rationality  and selective attention effects that provide critical tests comparing fuzzy-trace theory  expected utility theory  and its variants e g   prospect theory
MISC	surprising implications for judgment and decision making in real life are also discussed  notably  that adaptive decision making relies mainly on gist-based intuition in law  medicine  and public health
MISC	what are the cutting-edge approaches to judgment and decision making that will be influential in the next decade
MISC	these questions concern new investigators  as they place bets with their most precious commodity  their time  by choosing topics in hopes of making an impact on the field
MISC	however  although new investigators strive to be original and forward thinking  they are also counseled to conduct programmatic and cumulative research
MISC	that is  to make progress on important topics  scientists must build on prior accomplishments  their own and those of others
MISC	these are my bets about which approaches have been productive and are gathering momentum
MISC	fortunately  these prognostications are more than simply my opinions barely more than that perhaps because they are based on the behavior of a community of scholars
MISC	what are the topics that i  and others  believe are taking off and will continue to progress
MISC	among the new trends  the most established topic-one that draws on a rich supply of prior research-is memory
MISC	researchers are increasingly turning to memory for explanations of judgment and decision making  citation
MISC	memory is much more than memorization  as i presently explain
MISC	a growing number of contemporary theories have memory as a common denominator  citation
MISC	development  defined as changes across the lifespan  is another topic that has gained ground
MISC	because of links to aging and to adolescent risk taking in psychiatry  public health  and neuroscience  this topic has surged in popularity  although it is less established within judgment and decision making  citation
MISC	notwithstanding that tversky and kahneman  citation  drew on piagetian cognitive illusions to characterize heuristics and biases  citation   theories of adult judgment and decision making are only now incorporating developmental results in their core assumptions
MISC	developmental results inform conceptions of whether choices are rational  adaptive  or good  citation
MISC	these results have been surprising
MISC	knowing that children reason rationally in the classic sense and that adults forego rational reasoning-which they are capable of-in favor of heuristics and biases casts explanations of judgment and decision making in an entirely new light  citation
MISC	last  the topic of meaning is the least established among the new trends
MISC	nevertheless  the concept of meaning has tremendous potential to organize thinking about judgment and decision making  to propel the field forward in new and original directions  and to effect practical changes in real-world behavior  citation
MISC	as sunstein  citation  advises   understanding of meaning and its malleabilitysuggests some tools that policymakers might use  p  number  and he exhorts public and private institutions to employ  meaning entrepreneurs  to move behavior in better directions
MISC	combining meaning  memory  and development  the perennially popular topic of intuition can be approached in a new way
MISC	fuzzy-trace theory integrates these topics by distinguishing between meaning-based memory representations-gist-and superficial verbatim representations of information
MISC	people use their memories to represent information even when the information is visible
MISC	intuition  in this view  relies on the meaning-based gist representations  but it is not developmentally primitive  citation
MISC	however  intuition produces meaning-based distortions in memory and reasoning
MISC	these distortions increase from childhood to adulthood  creating  developmental reversals   citation
OWNX	in the section below on origins  i describe how this integrated account of meaning  memory  and development came about
MISC	previous research has shown an association between emotions  particularly social emotions  and moral judgments
MISC	some studies suggested an association between blunted emotion and the utilitarian moral judgments observed in patients with prefrontal lesions
OWNX	we also found a negative association between the performance on recognition of social emotions and the proportion of affirmative responses on personal moral dilemmas
MISC	for decades  moral psychology was dominated by kantian-like rationalist theories that emphasized the role of conscious reasoning in the moral judgments of adults  citation
MISC	more recently  empirical researches suggested that moral judgment is predominantly intuitive  partly based on automatic emotional responses that are effortless and produced by unconscious processes
MISC	according to these perspectives  emotional processes play a crucial role in human decision making  including moral decisions  citation
MISC	the emotion based accounts of moral decision making draws support from a variety of empirical work  including behavioural and neuroimaging studies  citation
MISC	for instance  several studies with clinical groups with brain focal lesions  citation  reveal an association between impaired emotional processing and disturbances in moral behaviour
MISC	behavioural studies suggest that the manipulation of emotional states can influence the judgments in some moral situations  citation
MISC	in their neuroimaging study  koenigs and colleagues  citation  show that moral decision making tasks activate the same brain areas involved in emotions processing
MISC	despite these deficits regarding emotional regulation and response  frontal patients preserve their logical reasoning and declarative knowledge of social and moral norms  citation
MISC	in this sense  some frontal patients preserve intellectual abilities for example  fund of general information  ability to repeat and reverse digits  mental arithmetic  verbal reasoning  nonverbal problem solving  verbal and visual anterograde memory  visuospacial perception  academic achievement and maintain factual knowledge of social conventions and moral rules  citation
MISC	interestingly  besides an inadequate emotional processing  an atypical pattern of moral judgements has also been observed in this clinic population  citation
MISC	the experimental study of moral judgement has frequently relied on the analysis of subject reactions to moral dilemmas  fictional social situations specifically designed to pit two alternative actions against each other  the choice will inevitably disfavour one of the parties involved in the dilemma  citation
MISC	dilemmas are often subdivided into three categories  non-moral  impersonal moral and personal moral
MISC	a non-moral dilemma requires a decision that never involves a moral violation
MISC	in a moral dilemma the subject must typically choose between act and an omission  with the omission leading to greater harm
MISC	green and colleagues  citation  distinguished between  personal  and  impersonal  moral violations
MISC	they consider a moral violation to be  personal  if it meets three criteria   first  the violation must be likely to cause serious bodily harm
MISC	second  this harm must befall a particular person or set of persons
MISC	third  the harm must not result from the deflection of an existing threat onto a different party  citation
MISC	the  hurt  criterion picks out the most primitive kinds of harmful violations   you  criterion ensures that the victim is vividly represented as an individual  and the  me  captures a notion of  agency   requiring that the action springs in a direct way from the agent's will  that it be  authored  rather than merely  edited  by the agent
MISC	a moral violation is impersonal if it fails to meet these three criteria
MISC	another important distinction between personal and impersonal moral dilemmas relates to their emotional level  personal moral dilemmas are characterized by high level of emotional intensity
MISC	personal dilemmas are particularly intense because the moral violation option also represents an utilitarian response
MISC	securing the welfare of the collective by sacrificing a single person individual might be the ultimate moral goal of a society  however to choose this utilitarian option appears to be far from natural in normal individuals
MISC	brain damaged patients with impaired emotion processing often produce an abnormally utilitarian pattern of judgments on moral dilemmas
MISC	for example  patients with frontal lesions seem to choose to suffocate their own child in order to save a group of people who otherwise would die  including the baby  citation
MISC	apparently  these patients often decide to secure the welfare of the collective even if it means sacrificing someone dear to them  an utilitarism attitude that suggest a diminished emotional responsivity
MISC	anderson  barrash  and bechara  citation  argue that the abnormally high rate of utilitarian judgments observed in frontal brain injured patients with deficits in emotional response suggests that their decisions are mostly cognitive  intentional and conscious  uncontaminated by emotion
MISC	functional neuroimaging studies of emotion recognition and moral judgment tasks highlight the pre-frontal cortex as dominant in the regulation of emotional behaviour as well as morality  citation
MISC	the frontal lesion patients reveal idiosyncratic response patterns to some dilemmas when compared to patients with lesions in other brain regions  citation
MISC	several studies further investigating which regions in the frontal cortex would be dominant for judging moral actions led to little consensus among researchers
MISC	actually  both authors recognize the unique contributions of all three regions that together are relevant to moral judgments  vmpfc responsible for emotional responding  ac for cognitive conflict and dlpfc for the abstract reasoning
MISC	both studies reported worse performance in patients with right and bilateral prefrontal cortex lesions
MISC	following this line of research  mendez and shapira  citation  also concluded that subjects with right frontal cortex lesions showed an inadequate response pattern for emotion processing and abnormal judgment of personal moral dilemmas
MISC	these results seem to converge on the idea that frontal cortex has a neuronal circuit for  morality   with predominance in the right hemisphere
MISC	regardless of which region in the prefrontal cortex is more dominant for moral judgments  evidence shows that damage to the prefrontal cortex impairs social and emotional behaviour  leading inevitably to some degree of social isolation
MISC	although several studies have examined emotional and behavioural changes in brain damaged patients  few studies pursued these changes specifically in frontal lesion subjects or investigated the possible association between social emotion processing and moral judgment
MISC	heuristic decision-making models  like take-the-best  rely on environmental regularities
MISC	they conduct a limited search  and ignore available information  by assuming there is structure in the decision-making environment
MISC	take-the-best relies on at least two regularities  diminishing returns  which says that information found earlier in search is more important than information found later  and correlated information  which says that information found early in search is predictive of information found later
OWNX	we then demonstrate  in the well-studied german cities environment  and three new city environments  when and how these regularities support take-the-best
OWNX	using this measure  we show that when the two environmental regularities are present  the decisions made by limited search are unlikely to have changed after exhaustive search  but that both regularities are often necessary
MISC	the us  dream team   filled with stars like michael jordan  magic johnson  larry bird  charles barkley and patrick ewing  was one of the most dominant teams ever assembled for any sporting competition
MISC	their closest game was a  number - number  victory in the final over croatia  and head coach chuck daly never felt the need to call a timeout during the tournament
MISC	making predictions about the outcomes of sporting contests is notoriously difficult  but the dream team made some predictions easy
MISC	at some point early in the us list-maybe after jordan  johnson  bird  barkley and ewing-there would be no need to look further
MISC	no matter who else was on the us roster  or the angolan roster  the outcome is already clear
MISC	the dream team also made predictions easy during the course of games
MISC	with about  number  minutes to play in the first half against angola  the us led  number  to  number 
MISC	it was clear the us would win by a large margin  without needing to watch the rest of the game
MISC	both of these decisions about a us victory are non-compensatory  because not all of the available information is used  and so the ignored information cannot compensate for-that is  change the decision based on-the information that is used
MISC	yet the decision to forego further information seems sensible in both cases
MISC	it is not a reaction to limited time or cognitive resources  but a recognition of the nature of the environment in which decision-making is taking place
MISC	the ratio-bias rb phenomenon is considered to provide systematic evidence of irrationality
MISC	when judging the probability of a low-probability event  many people judge it as less likely when it is expressed as a ratio of small numbers e g    number -in- number  than when it is expressed as a ratio of large numbers e g    number -in- number 
MISC	one factor is constant across the texts of the experiment  number - number   a particular sentence that induces subjects to neglect the equal ratio and invites them to express feelings about the outcome of the target event rather than giving a rational answer
MISC	this intent is strengthened by the formulation of the question experiment  number   which explicitly asks the subject to express the feeling connected to the lotteries and the absence of a third option experiment  number    number   the right one  which expresses the  indifference  between the two options
MISC	in experiment  number   the task lacks only the third option  and  simply by adding the option that allows subjects to express the correct answer  the rb disappears
MISC	the ratio-bias rb phenomenon occurs when people judge an unlikely event as less likely or more surprising when its probability is presented in the form of an equivalent ratio of smaller e g    number -in- number  versus larger e g    number -in- number  numbers  citation
MISC	the phenomenon seems to provide compelling evidence for the existence of two independent processing modes that sometimes conflict with each other and often interact in a manner that produces compromises  citation
MISC	a typical experimental paradigm is a game of chance  citation  in which subjects indicate from which of two trays of red and white jellybeans  one  large  e g    number  red out of  number  jellybeans and one  small  e g    number  red out of  number  jellybeans  they prefer to draw with the hope of obtaining a winning red jellybean
MISC	when the two trays offer equal probabilities of drawing a red jellybean  the rational decision is to report no tray preference
MISC	however  most subjects select the tray with the larger number of red jellybeans  and many  despite acknowledging they know better  are willing to pay small sums of money for the privilege of doing so  citation  rather than having the selection made randomly
MISC	subjects were instructed to indicate how they believed most people would behave others-perspective and how they believed they themselves would behave self-perspective
MISC	according to these authors  judging others' behavior is more revealing because it circumvents subjects' desire to present themselves as rational people
MISC	the ratio bias has been investigated in the health domain by yamagishi  citation  and pinto-prades et al citation
MISC	yamagishi  citation  gave subjects mortality rates for well-known causes of death  varying both the percentage incidence rate and the population frame deaths per  number  or  number   number  people within subjects
MISC	ratings of risk were consistently higher with a frame of  number   number  than a frame of  number   regardless of the actual percentage incidence rate
MISC	similarly  pinto-prades et al citation  investigated and replicated the ratio bias in the context of choices between medical treatments with a given probability of death
MISC	many studies on the rb  citation  have presented subjects with a choice between a  number -in- number  chance of success and a  number -in- number  chance of success as well as a choice between  number -in- number  and  number -in- number 
MISC	they found that many individuals  number  percent  and  number  percent   respectively preferred the latter choice the large urn even though the former the small urn offered a greater probability of success
MISC	the existence of the bias has also been confirmed in studies testing the effect of incentives  citation
MISC	a recent study of risky judgments  citation  also provides support for the rb effect over a conflicting theory  the construal level theory clt
MISC	dynamic  connectionist models of decision making  such as decision field theory  citation   propose that the effect of context on choice arises from a series of pairwise comparisons between attributes of alternatives across time
MISC	as such  they predict that limiting the amount of time to make a decision should decrease rather than increase the size of contextual effects
MISC	this prediction was tested across four levels of time pressure on both the asymmetric dominance  citation  and compromise  citation  decoy effects in choice
MISC	overall  results supported this prediction  with both types of decoy effects found to be larger as time pressure decreased
MISC	a wide body of research has demonstrated the contextual sensitivity of preference  showing that preferences to some degree depend upon the set of inferior alternatives considered at the time of choice
MISC	decoy effects  such as the asymmetric dominance ad  citation  and compromise effects c  citation   are common examples of this sensitivity
MISC	in particular  decoy effects are examples of preference reversals  situations in which the preference ordering between two alternatives changes with changes in context
MISC	although much research has focused on demonstrating and explaining decoy effects  little work has been done to explore the effect that time pressure can have on the effect of the decoy
OWNX	we asked whether people can make their confidence judgments more realistic accurate by adjusting them  with the aim of improving the relationship between the level of confidence and the correctness of the answer
MISC	this adjustment can be considered to include a so-called second-order metacognitive judgment
MISC	the participants first gave confidence judgments about their answers to questions about a video clip they had just watched
MISC	next  they attempted to increase their accuracy by identifying confidence judgments in need of adjustment and then modifying them
MISC	the participants managed to increase their metacognitive realism  thus decreasing their absolute bias and improving their calibration  although the effects were small
OWNX	we also examined the relationship between confidence judgments that were adjusted and the retrieval fluency and the phenomenological memory quality participants experienced when first answering the questions  this quality was one of either remember associated with concrete  vivid details or know associated with a feeling of familiarity
OWNX	in brief  our results provide evidence that people can improve the realism of their confidence judgments  mainly by decreasing their confidence for incorrect answers
MISC	thus  this study supports the conclusion that people can perform successful second-order metacognitive judgments
MISC	realistic confidence judgments about retrieved memories are important in a number of contexts e g   medical and legal contexts
MISC	for example  an eyewitness to a crime must judge his or her level of confidence about correctly having identified the criminal
MISC	although many witnesses may feel confident about their identification  the relation between identification confidence and the correctness of the identification is weak  citation
MISC	in spite of this weakness  research has also shown that jurors often judge eyewitness credibility based on the level of confidence the eyewitness expresses  citation
MISC	thus  the level of confidence about a memory report should be as accurate as possible relative to the correctness of the report  citation
MISC	in general  the realism of confidence judgments pertains to how well a person's confidence for a memory report matches the correctness of the report  citation
OWNX	in this study  we attended only to participants' ability to improve calibration
MISC	numerous studies have reported that people often show overconfidence e g   they are more confident than their memory report is correct
MISC	this is the case both for general knowledge questions  citation  and event memory questions  citation   although the basis of this so-called overconfidence effect has been widely debated  citation
MISC	given that people show a lack of realism in their confidence judgments in many contexts  finding ways to help people improve the realism of their confidence judgments is important
MISC	the task of improving the realism of a confidence judgment  designated here as the adjustment task  involves first identifying which confidence judgments to adjust and then modifying them
MISC	when trying to improve the realism of confidence judgments  people presumably rely on various types of cues
MISC	three experiments tested if individuals show violations of transitivity in choices between risky gambles in linked designs
MISC	the binary gambles varied in the probability to win the higher better prize  the value of the higher prize  and the value of the lower prize
MISC	each design varied two factors  with the third fixed
MISC	designs are linked by using the same values in different designs
MISC	linked designs allow one to determine if a lexicographic semiorder model can describe violations of transitivity in more than one design using the same parameters
MISC	in addition  two experiments tested interactive independence  a critical property implied by all lexicographic semiorder models
MISC	very few people showed systematic violations of transitivity  only one person out of  number  showed violations of transitivity in two designs that could be linked by a lexicographic semiorder
MISC	however  that person violated interactive independence  as did the majority of other participants
MISC	most individuals showed systematic violations of the assumptions of stochastic independence and stationarity of choice responses
MISC	that means that investigators should evaluate models with respect to response patterns response combinations rather than focusing entirely on choice proportions
MISC	descriptive theories of risky decision making can be divided into two groups  those that satisfy transitivity of preference and those that do not
MISC	transitivity of preference is the assumption that  if a person prefers a to b and prefers b to c  then that person should prefer a to c  apart from random error
MISC	theories that represent each gamble by a single number automatically imply transitivity
MISC	these theories assume that a   x number b  b   x number d number   ua  greater than  ub  where ua and ub are the numerical values or utilities of the two gambles
MISC	theories that represent choice in terms of contrasts between the components of the alternatives  however  need not satisfy transitivity of preference
MISC	theories that violate transitivity include the family of lexicographic semiorder ls models  the priority heuristic  regret theory rt  the stochastic difference model sdm and others  citation
MISC	magical beliefs about contagion via contact  citation  may emerge when people overgeneralize real-world mechanisms of contamination beyond their appropriate boundaries  citation
MISC	do people similarly overextend knowledge of airborne contamination mechanisms
MISC	adults showed a clear proximity effect  wherein objects near the contamination source were perceived to be less desirable than those far away  even though a separate group of adults unanimously acknowledged that contaminants could not possibly have made contact with either the nearby or far-away object study  number 
MISC	the proximity effect also remained robust when a third group of adults was explicitly told that no contaminating particles had made contact with the objects at any time study  number 
MISC	people often resist reconciling their intuitive beliefs about the world with more recently learned theories uncovered by science
MISC	for example  people may intuitively cling to the belief that catching a cold is directly caused by exposure to cold temperatures
MISC	although scientific research has revealed alternative mechanisms e g   rhinovirus transmission that have come to be broadly accepted by the lay public  people may nonetheless behave in accordance with their initial belief
MISC	for instance  people's excessive avoidance of aids patients  despite explicit knowledge that hiv cannot be transmitted via casual contact  is partially fueled by non-scientific  intuitive theories of contamination  citation
MISC	in general  such irrational or magical beliefs may emerge when people's core intuitive knowledge and assumptions about major domains  citation  are inappropriately overgeneralized to other domains or situations  citation
MISC	for example  beliefs about contamination that are correct within the biological domain can be overextended to the psychological domain  yielding behaviors consistent with the belief that a socially disliked person can somehow transmit undesirable properties onto objects he or she touches  citation
MISC	perhaps the most well-known of such overextensions of domain knowledge is the magical contagion effect in adults  wherein people permanently reject objects that had come into even brief  innocuous contact with an aversive source  citation
MISC	for example  adults rejected a thoroughly washed sweater worn by a homeless person  citation  and juice touched by a sterilized cockroach  citation
MISC	in these instances  there is no real danger of contamination  citation   yet even when any physical justification for rejection is removed e g   via washing or sterilization  people continue to reject the contacted object
MISC	in studies such as these  rozin and colleagues demonstrated modern adults' adherence to several key features of the anthropologically and historically documented magical law of contagion  citation   which fundamentally states that objects  once in contact are always in contact
MISC	rozin and colleagues thereby clearly argued  and showed  that contact is the central characteristic of the magical contagion effect  citation
MISC	given the absence of contact  the proximity effect is conceptually distinct from the magical law of contagion  once in contact  always in contact 
MISC	the proximity effect  if obtained  could readily be construed as an overextension of known mechanisms for airborne contamination to situations in which it is clearly impossible
MISC	there is some prior evidence that very young children behave as though an item is contaminated just by being near a contaminant  citation
MISC	in one developmental study  for example  springer and belk  citation  told children one of several stories about a boy who drank a glass of juice
MISC	in their  physical contact  story  a bug first fell into the juice and was removed  in their  proximity  story  the bug was near the juice but never made contact with it
MISC	most  number - number -year-olds in their study rejected the juice only in the physical contact story
MISC	indeed  there has been little or no evidence to suggest otherwise  as experiments on the proximity effect have rarely been attempted with adults  who presumably know the correct mechanisms of contamination
MISC	if even the most minimal contact with the source was clearly and completely eliminated  would adults still behave as though contamination occurs
MISC	whether adults show such an overextension of knowledge about airborne contamination is an open question
MISC	one possibility is that by adulthood  such naive  radically inaccurate theories of contamination have been edited or replaced by more scientifically grounded theories
OWNX	in our study  we used scenarios that even adults would not encounter frequently  thereby increasing our ability to measure their intuitive  unpracticed responses
OWNX	previously  only toyoma  citation  reported preliminary evidence for a proximity effect in both children and adults  using verbally described scenarios in which a child came upon a glass and found that it had a contaminant e g   a roach either inside or next to the glass
MISC	however  in that study  it was very ambiguous as to whether contact with the contaminant had ever occurred before the child's encounter with them e g   a live roach could have crawled anywhere prior to that moment  making it perfectly reasonable to reject the glass
MISC	this is a critical problem  given that work on the dose insensitivity principle  citation  has repeatedly shown that even the briefest and tiniest point of contact is still treated as contact  following the magical law of contagion
MISC	therefore  it remains unknown whether adults would show a true proximity effect  such that they reject an item while believing that its contamination was physically impossible
MISC	similarly  studies using  chain of contagion  tasks cannot be construed as definitive tests of the proximity effect
MISC	in such tasks  a clean pencil is touched to a contaminant  a second clean pencil is then touched to the first pencil  and so on for a total of  number  pencils  with contamination judgments made for each pencil in the chain  citation
MISC	these studies showed that adults' judgments of contamination decrease moving down the chain  and never come close to zero
MISC	however  in this paradigm  contact clearly occurred at each point in the chain
MISC	therefore  contamination beliefs about the second pencil can be explained in that the second pencil made physical contact with the now-contaminated first pencil  which  by the magical law of contagion  allowed the first pencil to transmit the contagion
MISC	adults' judgments in this task thereby demonstrated adherence to the magical law of contagion and its principles e g   physical contact  dose insensitivity  and permanence  but the task does not constitute a clear test of the proximity effect
MISC	finally  the well-known study wherein people rejected fudge shaped to look like feces  citation  cannot reasonably be reinterpreted as having shown the proximity effect
OWNX	although no contact with a contaminant was involved in that study paradigm  neither was the effect of proximity to a contaminant tested
MISC	that is  in that study  there was no contaminant to which an object could be proximal
MISC	rozin et al citation  instead designed the fudge-resembling-feces study as a test of a conceptually distinct  anthropologically documented law of sympathetic magic known as the law of similarity  which holds that  appearance is reality  e g   if it looks like feces  it must also share some of the other properties of feces
MISC	the current work departed clearly from rozin and colleagues' task in that participants rated the desirability of having contact with objects that had been in varying degrees of proximity with different sources
MISC	contact with the aversive source was eliminated in the critical conditions to measure the effect of proximity
MISC	the current study examines the construct validity of the maximization scale  citation  and the maximization tendency scale  citation   as well as the nomological net of the maximizing construct
OWNX	finally  we suggest that future maximizng research use revised form of the mts that seems to us to be most consistent with the original concept of maximizing satisficing
MISC	the conceptualization and measurement of the maximizing construct has received considerable attention in the last ten years  citation
MISC	however  in an evaluation of the existing data and economic models simon  citation  stated   evidently  organisms adapt well enough to 'satisfice'  they do not  in general  'optimize'
MISC	  building on this research  schwartz et al attempted to define the psychological effects of maximizing for those who pursue maximizing goals
MISC	schwartz et al developed a  number -item measure of maximization maximization scale  ms and found that scores from the ms correlated positively with depression  perfectionism  and regret and correlated negatively with happiness  life satisfaction  optimism  and self-esteem
MISC	since the development of this scale  there has been considerable debate about the validity of the measure and the development of alternative measures
MISC	diab et al citation  developed a new maximization scale maximizing tendency scale  mts and found that the mts did not correlate with constructs such as depression  life satisfaction  and neuroticism
MISC	however  their scale did correlate positively with regret
MISC	lai  citation  also developed a new scale of maximizing and found that it correlated positively with optimism and need for cognition  but the correlation between her measure of maximizing and regret was inconsistent across samples
MISC	finally  rim et al citation  examined both the ms and mts using item response theory irt and found that both scales had weakness in measuring the maximizing construct
MISC	they also found that the mts was not unidimensional as proposed by diab et al citation
MISC	however  rim et al did not discuss removing problematic items
OWNX	the purpose of the current study is to examine both the ms and mts using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis  and then use polytomous irt to resolve the problems found in the scales
OWNX	in addition  we test whether these solutions can answer the question of whether maximizers are happy or unhappy
MISC	decision makers are often ambiguity averse  preferring options with subjectively known probabilities to options with unknown probabilities
MISC	the ellsberg paradox is the best-known example of this phenomenon
MISC	ambiguity has generally been studied in the domain of risky choice  and many theories of ambiguity aversion deal with ambiguity only in this context
MISC	however  ambiguity aversion may occur in other contexts
MISC	subjects imagine they are expecting a package and must choose between two delivery options
MISC	some delivery times are exact
MISC	others are ambiguous  with delivery possible over a range of dates
MISC	this problem was structurally identical to the ellsberg paradox
MISC	subjects showed the same pattern of responses as in the traditional ellsberg paradox  with each delivery service preferred when it was the unambiguous option
MISC	ambiguity aversion is not specific to risk  but can also occur in other domains
MISC	when faced with a decision  a logical first question is   what will happen if i do this
MISC	  frequently these are not questions that can be answered with certainty
MISC	if i get this treatment  what is the probability i will get better
MISC	 often these questions cannot be answered with any degree of certainty  either
MISC	many real-world decisions are ambiguous
MISC	to apply expected utility theory eut  the normative theory of risky choice  to these ambiguous situations  decision makers must produce a subjective estimate of the absent probabilities regardless of whether they feel that they have sufficient information to do so
MISC	according to expected utility theory  a decision maker should evaluate a gamble by multiplying the probability of each outcome by a numerical measure of the goodness of the outcome  the utility
MISC	the sum of the resulting numbers is the expected utility of the gamble  and the decision maker should choose the gamble for which this value is higher
MISC	because it can be derived from defensible axioms  and because no other system will result in better aggregate outcomes over time  eut is considered to be the normative theory of decision making  citation
MISC	however  challenges soon arose to the suggestion that eut is a descriptive theory of choice
MISC	one of the earliest objections was made by ellsberg  citation   who proposed what is now known as the ellsberg paradox according to eut  a decision maker should choose the same outcome in both gamble pairs
MISC	to do otherwise would violate the sure-thing principle  which states that changing an outcome common to two gambles should not change a decision maker's preference between them
MISC	if a decision maker prefers the red gamble to the black gamble in pair one  it implies the decision maker thinks that there are more red balls than black balls
MISC	however  if there are more red balls than black balls  there must be more total red and yellow balls than total black and yellow balls  and the decision maker should prefer the red gamble to the black gamble in pair two as well
MISC	a symmetrical argument demonstrates that decision makers who prefer the black gamble in pair two should prefer the black gamble in pair one
MISC	adding the common outcome of winning   number  if a yellow ball is drawn should not change whether the decision-maker prefers to bet on the red or the black ball
MISC	however  ellsberg found that decision makers prefer the red gamble in the first pair  but prefer the black gamble in the second pair
MISC	instead  a decision maker which shows this pattern of choices is displaying ambiguity aversion-in each pair  preferring to gamble on a known number of balls to gambling on an unknown number
MISC	subsequent experiments have confirmed ellsberg's intuition  both about the pattern of choices shown in the ellsberg paradox and about ambiguity aversion more generally  citation
MISC	ellsberg discussed ambiguity strictly in terms of risky choice  and subsequent work has generally followed this lead  ambiguity is defined as an unknown probability -that is  a probability for which the decision maker feels that she does not have enough information to make a subjective estimate
MISC	however  it seems possible that ambiguity aversion may be a more general phenomenon  not constrained to risky choice
MISC	specifically  analogous phenomena may occur in the in the realm of intertemporal choice  choices made about outcomes that occur at different times
MISC	for example  an investor must choose between spending a small amount of money now and saving the money to have a larger amount of money later
MISC	in many cases  the length of time that will pass before receiving the outcome cannot be estimated with any degree of accuracy  the equivalent to ambiguous probabilities in risky choice
MISC	the present experiment examines whether the effects of ambiguity in the domain of delay are similar to the effects of ambiguity on risky choice
MISC	background  the domain-specific risk taking scale dospert is a widely used instrument that measures perceived risk and benefit and attitude toward risk for activities in several domains  but does not include medical risks
MISC	objective  to develop a medical risk domain subscale for dospert
OWNX	we conducted cognitive telephone interviews  an online survey  and a random-digit dialing rdd telephone survey to reduce and refine the scale  explore its factor structure  and obtain estimates of reliability
MISC	participants  eight patients recruited from uic medical center waiting rooms participated in  number - number  minute cognitive interviews
MISC	one hundred chicago-area residents completed the rdd telephone survey
OWNX	results  on the basis of cognitive interviews  we eliminated five items due to poor variance or participant misunderstanding
MISC	factor analysis of the responses in the rdd telephone survey and non-statistical factors led us to recommend a final set of  number  items to represent the medical risk domain
OWNX	the final set of items included blood donation  kidney donation  daily medication use for allergies  knee replacement surgery  general anesthesia in dentistry  and clinical trial participation
MISC	the interitem reliability cronbach's  alpha  of the final set of  number  items ranged from  number   number - number   number  depending on the response task
MISC	older respondents gave lower overall ratings of expected benefit from the activities
MISC	perceptions of risk and benefit and preference for risk are important constructs in decision making under uncertainty
MISC	dospert is a widely used instrument that measures conventional risk attitudes likelihood of engaging in activities defined as objectively risky and perceived risk attitudes likelihood of engaging in activities perceived to be risky by the respondent under the assumption that these constructs may differ by the domain of risk  citation
MISC	dospert encompasses six risk domains  ethical  gambling  health safety  investing  recreational  and social risk taking
MISC	in each domain  risk perception  benefit perception  and risk attitude are measured using  number -point category rating scale responses to six items per domain
MISC	notably  although dospert is one of very few measures recommended for use in assessing risks in health-related or clinical decisions in a recent review  citation   and the only measure with extensive psychometric evidence and measures of risk perception  benefit perception  and risk attitude  dospert's health safety scale focuses on preventive safety behaviors such as wearing a seatbelt and does not include items that sample the types of risk activities commonly encountered in health care settings
MISC	for example  young  et al citation  found no differences on the dospert health safety subscale among potential living kidney donors  potential recipients  and transplant specialists  despite marked differences in their expressed tolerance for donation-related health risks
MISC	blais and weber  two dospert developers  also reported that the dospert health safety scale may require revision  as it appears to primarily measure variance also associated with the ethical domain perhaps because several of the health safety items reflect socially proscribed behaviors  such as unprotected sex or heavy drinking  citation
MISC	the goal of this study was to develop a six-item add-on dospert subscale designed to measure attitudes toward risky medical activities
MISC	these studies incorporate what have been termed the  substantive validity  and  structural validity  phases of scale development  citation
OWNX	we performed two experiments with four experimental conditions
OWNX	in condition  number   we manipulated the frequency with which low- and high-stimuli were presented
OWNX	in condition  number   we used payoff structures that mimicked the frequency manipulation
OWNX	we found that manipulating stimulus frequency resulted in a larger effect on rt and accuracy than did manipulating payoff structure
OWNX	in the model  we found that manipulating stimulus frequency produced greater changes in the starting point of the evidence accumulation process than did manipulating payoff structure
OWNX	in conditions  number  and  number   we set the decision cutoff at  number    number   or  number  experiment  number  and at  number  or  number  experiment  number 
MISC	the model analyses showed that starting-point changes accounted for biases produced by changes in stimulus proportions  whereas evidence biases accounted for changes in the decision cutoff
MISC	it is well known that experimental manipulations in perceptual decision making tasks produce systematic changes in the behavioral responses of the subjects
MISC	experimental psychologists  for example  have observed that subjects bias their responses based on the probability of occurrence of the stimulus  citation
MISC	formal models have been used to describe and predict response bias in perceptual two-choice tasks  citation
MISC	these models typically conceptualize the decision process as the accumulation of sensory information over time towards a decision threshold
MISC	the aim of this study was to use one of these models  citation  to examine what processes account for biases in two-choice tasks produced by manipulations of stimulus frequency  payoffs  and movement in the decision cutoff i e   the point at which stimuli are assigned to one versus the other response category
MISC	in manipulations of stimulus frequency  it is well known that response times rts to stimuli that appear more often are faster than rts to stimuli shown less often
MISC	in addition  accuracy is increased from less to more frequent stimuli
MISC	remington  citation   for example  used a task in which subjects responded to one of two lights by depressing corresponding keys
MISC	there were blocks of trials in which each light was turned on in half of the trials  blocks in which one light was turned on in  number  percent  of the trials and the other in  number  percent  of the trials  and blocks in which these proportions were reversed
MISC	in comparison to the equally likely condition  response times rts were faster for trials in which a light appeared more often and slower for trials in which it appeared less often
MISC	studying the effects of explicit payoff manipulations has also been of long-standing interest in cognitive psychology  citation
MISC	fitts  citation   for example  used payoff matrices to allow subjects to earn a bonus at the end of a session
MISC	subjects always earned one point for each correct and fast response  but lost points based on one of the following structures  one  they lost half a point for correct and slow responses  one tenth of a point for wrong and fast and responses  or one point for wrong and slow responses  two  they lost one tenth of a point for correct and slow responses  half a point for wrong and fast responses  or one point for wrong and slow responses
MISC	fitts found that subjects either responded faster and made more errors or responded more slowly and made fewer errors  in order not to lose too many points
MISC	the two rhesus monkeys tested showed indistinguishable psychophysical performance in the neutral reward conditions but biased performance i e   faster response and increased response probability toward the high-reward response in biased conditions
MISC	would you redirect a trolley to save five people even if it means that the trolley will run over a person on the side track
MISC	most people say they would
MISC	would you push that same person into the path of the trolley in order to save the five
MISC	most people say they would not
MISC	these sorts of intuitive moral judgments are made rapidly and seem almost automatic
MISC	now imagine a combined choice context where one can redirect a trolley  push a person in its path or do nothing
MISC	the number of lives lost from intervening can be varied
MISC	the most straightforward interpretations of current theories of moral judgment predict either no effect or that the combined context will lead to greater focus on lives lost
OWNX	in contrast  we observe a similarity effect such that utilitarian choice may become less attractive in the combined choice context
MISC	moral judgments are often contrasted with mundane or secular decision making  such as consumer choice
MISC	the latter predominantly involves weighing costs and benefits  which often may not be the preferred strategy in moral situations
MISC	in the now classic trolley problem  citation  a runaway trolley threatens to run over and kill five people trapped on a railroad track
MISC	if a switch is flipped  the trolley will move onto another track  saving the five but killing a person trapped on that track
MISC	in the footbridge version the only way to save the five is to push a large person off a bridge to stop the trolley
MISC	most people approve flipping the switch  but disapprove of pushing the person  patterns so consistent that some have claimed they are universal  citation
MISC	one popular distinction is the doctrine of double effect  which differentiates between harm caused as means and harm caused as a side effect
MISC	harm as means  such as when the actor uses the body of a single victim to prevent the death of a larger number of people  is considered impermissible
MISC	harm as a side effect  however  such as when the trolley kills the single victim after redirected on the sidetrack  is considered permissible
MISC	other relevant distinctions are between direct and indirect harm  citation   and intervention on the victim versus intervention on the harmful object  citation
MISC	although most of the research on trolley problems has focused on factors associated with the intervention  others have looked at the role of utility of the outcomes
MISC	for example  sacrificing a stranger is approved more than sacrificing a relative  but sacrificing an obnoxious person a nazi soldier is approved more than sacrificing the stranger  citation
MISC	similarly  the lives of in-group members are valued more than the lives of out-group members  citation
MISC	an additional indicator of sensitivity to outcomes is that  when the number of lives at stake increases  the approval for intervention to save these lives increases too  citation
MISC	finally  trolley dilemmas have been shown to be influenced by framing of the experimental question
MISC	positive framing  focusing on attention to number of lives saved by the intervention  leads to greater approval for action than negative framing  which focuses it on number of lives lost as a result of the intervention  citation
OWNX	our study is concerned with context effects based on combining the two classic scenarios into one where the actor can throw a switch to redirect the trolley  push a person off the footbridge or do nothing
OWNX	as in the standard case omission leads to five deaths  pushing causes one death and we vary the number of deaths associated with redirecting the trolley
MISC	current moral theories typically do not make explicit predictions about extended context comparisons though the most straightforward interpretations suggest that a combined contexts increase attention to outcomes
MISC	for example  mikhail  citation  proposed a switch version with two side-tracks  on one of which there is a person  and the other is empty
OWNX	under this condition redirecting the trolley onto the track with the single person on it becomes morally prohibited
OWNX	in our study  however we varied both the action and the outcomes in such a way that no choice transparently dominated any other choice
MISC	pushing a person is less desirable than throwing a switch all else equal but killing two people is less desirable than killing one
MISC	if the combined choice context increases attention to outcomes  then by mikhail's analysis the action of throwing the switch should be rated more negatively  because there is an option available leading to fewer deaths
MISC	for the same reason the act of pushing one person to save five should  if anything  become relatively more desirable
MISC	alternatively  the action of pushing may be seen as always wrong  so the disapproval of pushing would not be affected by context
OWNX	we collected pilot data on combined contexts that appeared to undermine these seemingly straightforward predictions
MISC	in particular  the presence of the switch option led to less approval of pushing the person  even when throwing the switch led to more deaths
MISC	this led us to consider a different form of choice context effect  a similarity effect
OWNX	we know of no theory of moral judgment that predicts similarity effects
OWNX	in what follows we first describe similarity effects and closely related context effects and then turn to a study aimed at examining choice context effects
MISC	toc paragraph choice context effects
MISC	--   h number  class  paragraph  sec anchor -- choice context effects
MISC	  h number  sec end --  the challenges that moral psychology faces when extrapolating results from binary moral dilemmas to broader contexts shows parallels with the development of choice theory  citation
MISC	one way is to ask them how much they are willing to pay for a given model
MISC	a shortcoming of this method is that it lacks a reference point to which a person compares the item  so in many cases such answers will not be very informative
OWNX	we can transform the choices into some preference metric which will tell us the relative ranking of each car compared to the rest
MISC	further  since such scale will assume transitivity  we can even rely on partial information  where if we do not have data from a direct comparison between cars a and c  we still can infer what people will choose based on the other comparisons in which these two cars participated  citation
MISC	these early promising attempts to model choice behavior were quickly undermined by new findings from a wider range of paradigms  citation
MISC	depending on the particular configuration of the choice set the addition of a new option has been found to systematically change the preferences
OWNX	several context effects have been identified  citation   for present purposes  we focus on similarity and compromise effects
MISC	the toyota prius gets better gas mileage  but the ford focus compensates by having a lower price
OWNX	further  imagine that in our hypothetical scenario she finds herself roughly indifferent  number - number  between the two options
MISC	many empirical studies  however  have established that people often violate this independence principle
MISC	with the  similarity effect   citation   adding a non-dominated option close to one of the alternatives tends to increase the relative share of its competitor
OWNX	informally  we could say that the insight steals more choices from the prius than from the focus
MISC	alternatively see figure  number   imagine adding a honda civic to the choice set rather than the honda insight and assume that the civic is more similar to the focus  being slightly better on gas mileage  but slightly more expensive
OWNX	we refer to this choice context effects as a similarity effect
MISC	in addition to the similarity effect  two other types of context effect are potentially relevant to the current work
MISC	the first is the compromise effect  whereby introducing a third option that results in one of the first two being seen as a compromise leads to an increase in choices of the compromise option  citation
MISC	conversely  adding a cheaper  less fuel efficient option to the prius versus focus choice set may make the focus a compromise and lead to it being favored
OWNX	how might compromise effects work in our hypothetical scenario
MISC	adding the option of pushing one person to save five could make throwing the switch a compromise between saving more versus fewer lives and  all else equal avoiding actions leading to any deaths
MISC	this leads to the counter-intuitive notion that adding the push option may make throwing the switch more desirable
OWNX	the final context effect we will mention stems from the work on separate versus joint evaluation
MISC	imagine you have to assign a value to two dictionaries  one in very good condition and containing  number   number  words  and the other in fair condition but with  number   number  words
MISC	hsee  citation  found that the smaller dictionary is priced higher than the larger one when each is evaluated in isolation separate evaluation  but the smaller dictionary received a lower pricing than the larger one in joint evaluation
MISC	according to the evaluability hypothesis  number of words is not very meaningful piece of information in separate evaluation because there is no reference point for comparison
OWNX	as a result  number of words becomes a more important dimension in joint  rather than in separate evaluation  citation
MISC	this would lead to the throwing switch option becoming less desirable  citation
MISC	are moral choices equally susceptible to these choice-set context effects
OWNX	our initial hunch was that instrumental choices would be based on evaluability
MISC	for example  an option saving three lives might be seen as quite positive by itself  but lose its value when there is an option available that would save four lives
MISC	but an inappropriate or immoral act  like pushing a person off a bridge  may remain immoral or equally bad  even when instrumentally less desirable options are added
MISC	the trolley and footbridge problems can be conceptualized as comprised of a choice set having two dimensions  one representing the value or utility of the number of people saved or lost and the other representing the value or cost intrinsic to the actions themselves  including inaction
MISC	this latter dimension is useful for the basic distinction or difference between throwing the switch acceptable versus pushing a person unacceptable when instrumental outcomes are the same
MISC	in addition  baron and his collaborators  citation  have shown that  when harmful outcomes are at stake  people often choose to do nothing  showing an omission bias
MISC	for example  one would expect that  given a choice between doing nothing and one person dies versus throwing a switch and one person dies  people will show a strong preference to do nothing
MISC	combining these observations  on the dimension of forms of action leading to harm in this context omission is preferable to throwing the switch which in turn is greatly preferable to pushing a person
MISC	and on the dimension of lives lost  less is better
OWNX	in the next section we present an empirical study which compares preferences for action and omission in five different choice sets
MISC	the key comparison is between two three-alternative choice-sets trilemmas  which have the same omission and footbridge-intervention options but differ in the number of victims for the switch intervention
OWNX	to determine the form of choice context effect ratings will be compared with two-alternative versions of these scenarios
MISC	the predictions of the different theories of context effects are summarized after the description of the design
MISC	very small but cumulated decreases in food intake may be sufficient to erase obesity over a period of years
MISC	making a food slightly more difficult to reach by varying its proximity by about  number  inches or changing the serving utensil spoon or tongs modestly but reliably reduces intake  in the range of  number - number  percent 
MISC	given this effect  it is possible that making calorie-dense foods less accessible and low-calorie foods more accessible over an extended period of time would result in significant weight loss
MISC	obesity is detrimental to health  and its prevalence has been growing steadily in the united states and elsewhere over recent decades
MISC	the national health and nutrition examination surveys nhanes estimate that the percentage of obese adults between the ages of  number  and  number  in america increased from  number   number  in  citation  to  number   number  in  number   citation
MISC	obesity is the second-leading cause of preventable deaths and increases risk of coronary heart disease  type ii diabetes  and other serious medical conditions  citation
MISC	although there is no doubt that obesity represents a serious health hazard  the framing of the problem as an  obesity epidemic  is misleading
MISC	obesity does not have two of the critical properties of epidemics   number  it is not contagious  and  number  its growth over time years or decades is not rapid and in an  s  shaped curve  but instead is very slow and steady
MISC	the most common medical treatment for obesity is dieting
MISC	yet most studies assessing this treatment find that it is ineffective
MISC	even when dieters lose weight  these losses are rarely maintained  citation
MISC	one review even concludes that it is  only the rate of weight regain  not the fact of weight regain  that is in question   citation
MISC	according to gallup polls  the percentage of americans  seriously trying to lose weight  increased between  citation  and  number   but americans got heavier nevertheless  citation
MISC	a promising alternative approach to the obesity problem is not to focus on or blame the obese individual  but rather to focus on the environment as a principal and  treatable  cause
MISC	in recent years  a group of researchers have independently advocated a focus on the environment to control the national waistline
MISC	originally proposed by hill and peters  citation   the approach has been endorsed  in one form or another  by brownell  citation   levitsky  citation   rolls  citation   rozin et al    number   wansink  citation   and young and nestle  citation
MISC	estimates of the increase in body weight per year of americans have been computed  and they vary depending on the time period measured and racial and age properties of the sample
MISC	based on the nhanes and cardia data bases  annual weight gain estimates in american adults vary from  number   number  pounds  number   number  kg to  number   number  pounds  number   number  kg per year  citation
MISC	the creeping increase in obesity could be halted or  in retrospect  could have been prevented by a very modest reduction in calories in the range of  number  to  number  kilocalories day  depending on many factors including assumptions about the efficiency of extracting energy from ingested foods  citation
MISC	the environmental alternative  in its most common and probably most practical form  involves interventions that have modest but cumulative effects on food intake  corresponding to the modest annual gains in weight
MISC	a number of environmental interventions have been shown to decrease food intake in a meal
MISC	the best-documented environmental influence is portion size
MISC	portion size has also been linked to bmi differences in field studies
MISC	the french-who consume more total fat and have slimmer figures than their american counterparts-have systematically and substantially smaller portion sizes in restaurants  food purchased in individual portion sizes  and cookbooks  citation
MISC	the slimmer status of the french strongly suggests that they eat fewer calories than americans  probably in part because they consume smaller portion sizes
MISC	a number of existing studies implicate accessibility as a determinant of consumption
MISC	most of these operationalize ease of access in terms of proximity i e   spatial location  which translates into effort
MISC	early work manipulating effort was motivated by schachter's  citation  theory of obesity  which predicted that obese individuals would reduce intake more than normal weight individuals as effort to obtain food increased
MISC	nisbett  citation  showed that obese individuals ate fewer sandwiches if they had to walk to a refrigerator to get them while normals were unaffected
MISC	similarly  schachter and friedman  citation  showed that obese individuals consumed less of shelled than unshelled almonds  but there was no effect for normals
MISC	schachter  friedman  and handler  number  showed that  of the caucasian patrons eating at a chinese restaurant  obese patrons were less likely to use chopsticks which  presumably  require more effort than normal weight patrons
MISC	another study supporting the schachter view was a demonstration that obese individuals eat fewer cashews when they are individually wrapped and normals do not  but the study also found no reduction in either group for wrapped versus unwrapped chocolates  citation
MISC	other studies testing the schachter hypothesis show no differences in environmental influence on obese versus normal subjects
MISC	levitz  citation  and meyers  stunkard  and coll  citation  showed a reduction in low-calorie dessert consumption when they were placed at the back in a four row deep dessert display as opposed to the front  in a cafeteria setting
OWNX	neither study reported a difference between obese and normal weight persons
MISC	levitz  citation  also reported that when the lid was on an ice cream cooler in a cafeteria setting  it reduced ice cream intake substantially in both obese and normal weight individuals
MISC	meiselman et al citation  reported large decreases in intake of potato chips and candy in a cafeteria setting  when they were made quite inaccessible  by locating them some distance from the main serving line
MISC	engell et al citation  found that individuals drink more water while eating if the water pitcher is on the table versus  number  or  number  feet away
MISC	more recently  wansink  painter  and lee  citation  demonstrated that secretaries consume more candy when the bowl is on their desk as opposed to at another location in the room
MISC	the work by levitz  citation  and meyers  stunkard  and coll  citation  referred to above suggests that modest changes in positioning of foods can influence food intake
MISC	all of the successful manipulations in accessibility referred to here were shown to be effective in single meals
MISC	the present studies explore the effects of small  usually unnoticed environmental changes
MISC	these changes are called nudges  citation  because they subtly encourage consumption of less calorie-dense food without altering the choice set
OWNX	hence our title  nudge to nobesity i
MISC	individual differences in decision making are a topic of longstanding interest  but often yield inconsistent and contradictory results

OWNX	today the debate continues amid increasing evidence that the answer is neither one  citation  nor the other  citation   but rather the two in combination  citation
MISC	further evidence against simple  one-or-the-other approaches comes from the emerging field of epigenetics  which documents biochemical mechanisms through which environmental conditions regulate gene expression  citation

MISC	dmidi
MISC	despite their efforts to choose the best of all available solutions  maximizers seem to be more inclined than satisficers to regret their choices and to experience post-decisional dissonance
MISC	maximizers may therefore be expected to change their decisions more frequently and hence exhibit lower customer loyalty to providers of products and services compared to satisficers
MISC	maximizers reported significantly higher intentions to switch to another service provider television provider than satisficers
MISC	maximizers' intentions to switch appear to be intensified and mediated by higher proneness to regret  increased desire to discuss relevant choices with others  higher levels of perceived knowledge of alternatives  and higher ego involvement in the end product  compared to satisficers
MISC	opportunities for future research are suggested
MISC	schwartz et al citation  presented new evidence that people differ in their general motivation to invest time and resources in the decision making process
MISC	individuals with a preference for maximizing aspire to find the best possible option and are motivated to seek information about as many alternatives as possible before making a choice
MISC	individuals with a preference for satisficing  in contrast  tend to consider a more limited range of alternatives with the purpose of finding an option that satisfies given criteria or aspirations  i e   an option that is considered satisfactory or  good enough 
MISC	schwartz et al citation  propose that differences in the preference for maximizing versus satisficing may be conceptualized as a stable personality trait
MISC	some individuals are chronic maximizers whereas other individuals are habitual satisficers across a wide range of decision making tasks and domains
MISC	a particularly interesting finding from schwartz et al citation  and several subsequent studies is that maximizers  despite their efforts to find the best possible option  appear to regret their decisions more often than satisficers
MISC	subsequent studies also indicate that maximizers also tend to experience more postdecisional dissonance compared to satisficers  citation
MISC	these seemingly paradoxical findings are supported by other studies that indicate that the maximizing trait may represent a reliable predictor of whether or not a person is prone to change his her initial decisions
MISC	for example  in one study  maximizers were found to change their gift purchase decisions significantly more often than satisficers  if given the opportunity to do so  citation
MISC	preliminary findings also indicate that  in order be satisfied and engage in repeat purchase  maximizers rely more on high service quality than satisifcers  citation
MISC	implications of the maximizing trait for decision stability and change are of high potential significance to a wide array of personal or professional decision making domains  for example job search and career development  citation   negotiations  citation   investments  education  marriage or divorce  and consumer choice
MISC	in spite of the considerable costs associated with customer churn  determinants of consumers' decisions to switch brands or service providers are still not well understood
MISC	although there is an increased awareness that individual differences affect customers' attitudes and behaviors  very little is known about how and why customers differ  citation
MISC	schwartz et al 's  citation  work on the maximizing trait therefore offers valuable potential for advancing research on individual differences in customer behavior and choice
MISC	the main purpose of the present study is to investigate whether the maximizing trait is relevant to explaining customer loyalty and switch intentions  i e   whether or not maximizers are less loyal customers that more frequently intend to switch from one service provider to another
MISC	judgments and decisions under uncertainty are frequently linked to a prior sequential search for relevant information
MISC	in such cases  the subject has to decide when to stop the search for information
MISC	evidence accumulation models from social and cognitive psychology assume an active and sequential information search until enough evidence has been accumulated to pass a decision threshold
OWNX	in line with such theories  we conceptualize the evidence threshold as the  desired level of confidence  dlc of a person
MISC	this model is tested against a fixed stopping rule one-reason decision making and against the class of multi-attribute information integrating models
MISC	a series of experiments using an information board for horse race betting demonstrates an advantage of the proposed model by measuring the individual dlc of each subject and confirming its correctness in two separate stages
MISC	in addition to a better understanding of the stopping rule within the narrow framework of simple heuristics  the results indicate that individual aspiration levels might be a relevant factor when modelling decision making by task analysis of statistical environments
MISC	 some use it sometimes
MISC	 this is the short statement by which newell  citation  concluded the empirical research on the well-known take-the-best heuristic ttb
MISC	this fast and frugal heuristic was introduced by gigerenzer  hoffrage  and kleinbolting  citation  and gigerenzer and goldstein  citation  to provide an alternative to traditionally proposed strategies in judgment and decision making research
MISC	in the stimulus environment they used german cities  their population size and a number of features being present in the cities or not  this simple three-step-heuristic containing a search rule  a stopping rule and a decision rule led to decisions of the same quality as a comprehensive computational integration of the entire set of cue information
MISC	the termination of information search after having found a first discriminating cue has therefore been called one-reason decision making ordm  citation
MISC	the term ordm was chosen in clear contrast to models that stand for the integration of all available information usually not reflecting how the information was compiled
MISC	these models can be of varying complexity  ranging from simple tallying to complex multiple linear regression  citation
OWNX	these mathematical results allow ttb to rank amongst the rational strategies to be used in probabilistic decision making  especially but not only when information needs to be searched for
MISC	however  the empirical findings concerning the use of ttb - compared to mrdm models - were heterogeneous
MISC	while the conclusions of some studies were generally against the use of ttb because they found only particular use of this strategy  citation   a survey of more recent studies shows more evidence for the use of ttb  citation
MISC	one unresolved question is the fact that participants repeatedly showed a huge inter- and intra-individual inconsistency in using a single strategy  citation
MISC	so far  there have been no statistical environments in which all participants of an experiment acted according to ttb or refrained from using it
MISC	but what is even more problematic is the inconsistent use of the ordm stopping rule
MISC	the most surprising effect was reported by newell  weston and shanks  citation   testing a sequential search paradigm using only two available cues  they found a number of participants  number  percent  of their sample continuing information search in some instances even when the more valid cue discriminated  hence completely ignoring the fact that the second cue would not be able to compensate the first information
MISC	evidence  anecdotal and scientific  suggests that people treat or are affected by products of prestigious sources differently than those of less prestigious  or of anonymous  sources
MISC	finding for the latter  study  number  explores whether the poet's name changes the reader's experience of it  so that in a sense one is reading a  different  poem
OWNX	we conclude that it is not so much that the attributed poem really differs from the unattributed poem  as that it is just ineffably better
MISC	this is a more subtle bias than the deliberate one rejected in study  number   but it is a bias nonetheless
MISC	hearing a star soprano  or attending an exhibition by a famous painter  are expected to be exceptional experiences
MISC	and so they should be-their reputation was acquired precisely by their ability to provide such exceptional experiences
MISC	but hindsight can affect the remembered experience  it cannot affect the past experience itself  citation
MISC	can the actual experience of a poem rather than the expected or remembered experience be affected by expectations in real time
MISC	and if so-how does it happen
MISC	when the experience of a product is changed by its label  the change does not occur in the product
MISC	it would be undetected by an audio recording or a photograph
MISC	  however  experience is not determined by bottom-up processes alone
MISC	distal stimuli are only experienced through the proximal stimuli to which they give rise  and total experience takes place  in the eyes of the beholder -or even  ultimately  in the mind of the beholder
MISC	hence  for cognitive psychologists  it is obvious that expectations can alter experience  citation
MISC	social psychologists and cynics  however  will be quick to point out that one cannot rely on people's reports of their experiences to decide the matter  because reports are not always sincere or unbiased
MISC	allison  and  uhl  citation  were among the first to study these variables
MISC	they found that people could not identify their favorite brand of beer in blind tasting
MISC	later results were more startling  such as that blind tasters cannot distinguish dog food from pate  citation  or that experienced violinists cannot distinguish stradivari violins from new violins  citation
MISC	on the other hand  judges purport to distinguish among identical stimuli  when these are labeled differently  citation  or even just framed differently  citation
MISC	when comparing informed evaluations to blind evaluations  or ratings for differently labeled but identical products  some researchers automatically assume that a real change occurred in the experience e g   makens   number   p  number    a well-known brand positively affected the taste  italics ours  which ss experienced for samples of turkey meat   while others assume that it will not  citation
MISC	the question is clearly an empirical one  and  moreover  its answer could well differ from context to context  or from individual to individual
MISC	yet few studies have tackled this problem
MISC	lee et al    citation   when reviewing the literature  stated that   it remains unclear whether  manipulating the participant's  knowledge also changes the experience itself   just as it remains unclear in most taste-test studies whether brand identity is just another input to overall evaluation  or whether it modifies the actual gustatory experience  p  number 
MISC	few studies on expectation effects used cultural products
MISC	whereas wines  energy drinks and pain-killers affect the consumer's physiology  lending credence to the term  marketing placebos   citation   cultural products such as paintings or music are consumed primarily for their effect on the mind
MISC	it is harder to test whether a mental experience is altered than whether a physiological one is
MISC	this conundrum has itself been the focus of various cultural products e g   yasmina reza's play art
OWNX	study  number  sets the stage by establishing the effect we will later study in depth
MISC	experiment  number  incidentally adds that without the cue to quality imparted by the name of a reputable poet  readers cannot reliably distinguish good poetry from bad
MISC	that raises the sad possibility that the effect may be wholly due to pretension or to social desirability  as many outside critics of modern and contemporary art suspect
OWNX	it tests one particular model that we call the emperor's new clothes effect enc  for short  honoring anderson's famous parable
MISC	according to this model  the reading of the poem is the same with or without the poet's name  giving rise to the same aesthetic experience  the enhanced rating is solely due to a deliberate and conscious adding of points when the poem is attributed to a famous poet  motivated perhaps by a desire to appear discriminating and cultivated
MISC	study  number  tests an alternative model  which posits that the inclusion of the poet's name alters the very experience of the poem  so that once the poem's author is known  the poem is no longer  the same 
MISC	in other words  the poem-unchanged on the written page-is somehow changed in the reader's mind
OWNX	this we study by looking at judgments of many specific poem attributes
AIMX	we regard the main  and novel  contribution of this paper not in showing what happens  even in this previously unstudied context of poetry appreciation  but rather in attempting to understand the mental process whereby it happens
MISC	is it an unfortunate social bias  or an inevitable cognitive bias
MISC	investors  like any decision maker  feel regret when they compare the outcome of an investment with what the outcome would have been had they invested differently
OWNX	across five scenario experiments we found that decision makers were influenced only by forgone investment outcomes when the realized investment fell short of the expected result
MISC	however  when their investments exceeded prior expectations  the effect of foregone investment on regret disappeared
MISC	in addition  experiment  number  found that individual differences in the need to maximize further moderated the effects of their expectations  such that maximizers always take into account the forgone investment
MISC	it is a highly relevant emotion in the context of decision making and has been widely studied by psychologists  economists and consumer behavior researchers
MISC	regret is an unpleasant feeling  associated with the wish to undo the regretted event  a strong tendency to metaphorically kick oneself and wanting to get a second chance  citation
MISC	this makes regret uniquely linked to decisions made and it has been shown to be a powerful predictor of behavior
MISC	zeelenberg and pieters  citation  summarized the scattered findings and theories concerning regret and its impact on decision making and proposed an integrative theory of regret regulation  citation
MISC	in their proposition  number  p  number   they state that  regret is a comparison-based emotion of self-blame  experienced when people realize or imagine that their present situation would have been better had they decided differently in the past
MISC	  an investor who thinks  for example   if only i had bought google stock  i would have earned much more  feels regret
MISC	the theory of regret regulation was developed to understand how consumers deal with regret and it proposes strategies used to regulate it  citation
OWNX	we discuss here how prior expectations about the outcomes of decisions can play such a moderating role
MISC	to feel regret  one needs to run a mental simulation of what happened and what could have happened instead  then compare the two
OWNX	hence  the forgone outcome becomes the reference point against which regret is computed
MISC	this is how regret has been conceptualized in the early economic regret theories  citation  and has also been well established empirically  citation
MISC	this comparing of decision outcomes in regret and in rejoicing may by itself be consequential  as the comparative mind-set may actually carry-over to subsequent decisions  citation
MISC	interestingly  lin  huang  and zeelenberg  citation  found that the experience of regret can also be affected by other standards of comparison
MISC	through an online survey  they interviewed  number  stock investors from a security company
MISC	these investors answered several questions concerning their chosen and forgone investments
MISC	the results showed that forgone outcomes of considered but non-chosen investments indeed influenced the intensity of the regret felt over their investment
MISC	but  and this is relevant here  the a-priori expectations concerning the chosen investment were also significantly related to the regret these investors felt over their financial decisions
MISC	the larger the difference between the return on investment and these expectations  the more intense the regret
MISC	huang and tseng  citation  found similar effects in an experimental field study with  number  managers
MISC	comparisons of obtained outcomes to prior held expectancies have been linked in the literature to the emotional response of disappointment  citation   but not yet to regret  citation
MISC	this is interesting because regret and disappointment are in many ways related  though clearly distinct emotions  that both serve a role in decision making  citation
MISC	  it may well be the case that regret resembles disappointment in the sense that the experience is sensitive to expectancy violations
MISC	research has identified loss aversion as a strong and robust phenomenon  but has also revealed some moderators affecting the magnitude of its effect on decision making
OWNX	in three studies  we provide empirical evidence for such a measurement-induced focus
MISC	participants either filled out the loss side or the gain side of this gain loss ratio
MISC	the studies consistently showed that-using within- and between-subject designs and anticipated and real coin-toss gambles-the strength of loss aversion depended on the measurement format fill-in-the-loss versus fill-in-the-gain  filling in the loss side increased loss aversion
MISC	moreover  loss aversion was more affected by the stakes of the gamble in the fill-in-the-loss format than in the fill-in-the-gain format
MISC	when making decisions  decision-makers have to consider the potential outcomes  and thus consider the potential losses and gains that may occur
MISC	for example  when speculating on the stock exchange  we have to consider the potential losses should stock go down and the potential gains should stocks go up
MISC	when making such decisions-especially when people directly compare potential losses and gains-people often give more weight to the losses  citation
MISC	this larger weight given to negative outcomes is generally referred to as loss aversion  i e    losses loom larger than gains   citation
MISC	in addition to stock market decisions  loss aversion has been used to explain many effects observed in the context of decision making such as the sunk cost effect  citation   the status quo bias  citation   and the endowment effect  citation
MISC	for example  researchers generally assume that potential gains need to be approximately twice as large to offset the potential losses  citation
MISC	they introduced a loss aversion coefficient-the ratio g l gains losses that makes an even chance to gain g or lose l just acceptable  citation
MISC	they observed a gain loss ratio of  number   number   number  in their experiments  showing that gains on average need to be twice as large as the losses to make an even chance to gain g or lose l acceptable
MISC	study  number  demonstrated a positive correlation between sellers' first offers and their perceptions of the buyer's atp as well as its real economic power indicated by the company's market value
OWNX	we found a positive correlation between sellers' perception of buyers' atp  real atp as indicated by market value  and sellers' perception of buyers' availability of alternatives
MISC	however  when sellers were primed to concentrate on buyers' alternatives  their first offers were negatively related to perceived buyer's alternatives
MISC	every negotiation must start with a first offer by one of the negotiating parties
MISC	first offers determine the process and outcomes of negotiations  citation  by affecting both counteroffers and settlement prices  citation  through a process of anchoring and adjustment  citation
MISC	but although first offers have become an important research subject in recent years  citation   one simple question has not been fully answered  how do initiators decide the amount of their first offer
MISC	research indicates that negotiators focus on various cues and reference points when deciding the amount of their first offer
MISC	the main reference points include market prices  citation   reservation prices  citation   aspiration prices  citation   and own and counterpart's alternatives  citation
MISC	several of these cues might not be readily accessible  and negotiators might have to exert some  or even considerable  effort to find or identify them
MISC	on the other hand  easily available cues  such as counterpart's reputation  prestige  power or status  have not been investigated as potential determinants of the initial offers
MISC	one important variable is counterpart's wealth  or ability to pay atp
MISC	negotiators will make higher offers to wealthy counterparts because they believe that with greater resources the wealthy can afford to pay more
MISC	common wisdom suggests that this may indeed be the case  a contractor will charge more for fixing your roof if you live in an upscale neighborhood namely  you are considered to have high atp  lawyers charge higher fees from richer costumers  and the same mechanical repair will cost you more if you drive an expensive car which signals high atp
MISC	in legal settings  there is a widely held belief that jurors tend to award higher compensation for  deep pocket  defendants
MISC	second  if sellers believe that wealthier buyers are willing to pay more  than it is possible that more sellers would approach high atp buyers
MISC	taken together  these two reasons suggest that high atp negotiators have more alternatives for a given deal  and therefore their batna best alternative to a negotiated agreement would be better than the batna of low atp negotiators
MISC	with a better batna  high atp negotiators are less inclined to accept high offers
MISC	a somewhat parallel reasoning is evident in legal settings
MISC	on the one hand  jurors might be biased against wealthy defendants who can afford to pay and award them higher compensation
MISC	however   deep pockets  have more resources to fight back  citation
MISC	in the case of tort law   deep pockets  might have to pay out to many more claims  so they will tend to fight harder on an individual lawsuit
MISC	though considering the counterparts' viewpoint in a negotiation setting  particularly their alternatives for the present deal  is often recommended to negotiators  citation   information about counterpart's alternatives is often unavailable
MISC	in sum  this article focuses on a straightforward question  do sellers make different first offers for the same products or services when dealing with costumers of different economic resources
OWNX	though this question is simple  as far as we know it has not been empirically examined
MISC	this article aims to fill this gap by investigating the relation between counterpart's economic wealth and therefore its atp and first offers in negotiation
MISC	the first two studies provide lab and field tests for this prediction
OWNX	by using a questionnaire  we found higher subjective discounting for professional athletes than for non-athletes
OWNX	we also found that the professional athletes' win-orientation positively affected their present preferences
MISC	on the other hand  professional athletes' play- orientation  which reflects their attitude towards the game itself  negatively affected their present preferences
MISC	no such effects were found in non-athletes
MISC	the subjective time discount rate is measured by the rate between the amount individual is willing to receive in the future  instead of a given amount in the present
MISC	this rate decreases with one's willingness to wait  meaning higher rate for an individual who is less patient and more biased to the present
MISC	the literature on time subjective discounting is extensive
MISC	it is related to psychological characteristics and cultural and demographic differences  citation
MISC	the socio-emotional selectivity theory suggests that the perception of time plays a fundamental role in the selection and pursuit of social goals
MISC	carstensen et al citation  developed this theory and suggest   when the conclusion of the appraisal process is that time is limited  the acquisitive mode associated with unlimited time is transformed into a more present-oriented state
MISC	present orientation is likely to involve goals related to feeling states  deriving emotional meaning  and experiencing emotional satisfaction  p  number 
MISC	the group of professional athletes included olympic medalists  medalists from the european and world championships and members of national teams and national champions
MISC	the comparison of the psychological characteristics of athletes and non-athletes is one of the most frequently explored topics in personality studies related to sports
MISC	in the attempt to determine whether athletes differ from non-athletes  many researchers have looked at psychological  personality and perceptual-style variables
MISC	to the best of our knowledge  there are no studies that analyze professional athletes' time preference
MISC	mccann  citation  analyzed decision-making among professional athletes considering contract offers
MISC	specifically  he examined why some professional athletes pursue the most lucrative offer  while others do not  and to what extent cognitive biases and heuristics influence their decision-making
MISC	he suggests that the lack of studies on influence of behavioral tendencies on professional athletes is not surprising   given the relative paucity of professional athletes among the general population  their presumptively unique modes of employment  and a general aversion among academics to the study of sports  p  number 
MISC	indeed  by escaping the alleged 'experimental flaw' of many behavioral law and economic studies  professional athletes offer a uniquely appealing group for further examination
MISC	for that reason  recognition of how professional athletes respond to subjective stimuli  as well as cognitive distortions  may reveal as much about us as it does about them  p  number 
MISC	this competitive approach leads athletes to concentrate more on the present and sometimes sacrifice their future
AIMX	this paper examines the effect of information processing styles  citation  on adherence to bias judgments  and particularly to reverse biases  i e   when two choice questions that comprise identical normative components are set in different situations and yield seemingly opposite behavioral biases
OWNX	we found consistent evidence for a negative correlation between rational score and adherence to reverse biases  as well as overall biases  for all three pairs of reverse biases tested
OWNX	one of our colleagues recently complained that he finds the jdm field rather confusing
MISC	in his view  each time a new behavioral irregularity is found  jdm researchers classify their findings as a new heuristic
MISC	as a case in point  when people exhibit belief in positive recency  researchers tend to assume they have fallen prey to the hot-hand effect  citation
MISC	when individuals exhibit belief in negative recency  they are said to be the victim of the gambler's fallacy  citation
MISC	what can be learned from biases which lead in opposite behavioral directions
MISC	behavioral traps or genuine flip sides of the coin in everyday life
MISC	typically  two imperfectly correlated attributes are involved  such as the number of people affected by a choice option or the proportion of people affected
MISC	the two biases involve some attention to the normatively irrelevant attribute in each case
OWNX	reverse biases as we define them are thus different from the situation discussed by baron  citation  and illustrated by ratio bias in opposite directions  citation   the hot-hand vs the gambler's fallacy  citation   and action vs omission bias  citation
MISC	in these cases  biases in opposite directions can occur in the same task  for example  some people can favor harms caused by omission over lesser harms caused by action  while a few others favor harms of action over lesser harms of omission
MISC	demonstration of such opposite biases requires methods for statistical analysis of individuals  citation
MISC	the existence of individual differences in the utilization of heuristic thinking has been demonstrated for a variety of judgmental biases
MISC	these include risk perception  citation   risk seeking and avoidance  citation   binary guessing  citation   and variance in heuristic thinking  citation
MISC	however  traditional studies of heuristic thinking and biases mainly use group-level statistics to confirm the hypothesis that the number of participants exhibiting cognitive biases in each group cannot be due to chance
OWNX	we suggest that an individual who adheres to one direction of bias is not less prone to exhibit its reverse bias
MISC	previous research has shown the relation of several measures of information processing of thinking style to judgments
MISC	for example  shiloh  soltan  and sharabi  citation  reported systematic individual differences in participants' normative-statistical vs heuristic responses
MISC	normative-statistical responses were found to be positively correlated with a rational thinking style and negatively with an experiential thinking style
MISC	smith and levin  citation  identified need for cognition as a moderator of framing effects i e   the way information is presented
MISC	people who are low in need for cognition were more affected by framing effects
MISC	shiloh  koren and zakay  citation  found that compensatory decision-making style and need for closure were correlated with the complexity of the representation of a decision task
MISC	moreover  these individual differences in information processing styles may work in concert with several contextual factors to drive the decision process
MISC	for example  two such factors  according to stanovich and west  citation   are performance errors  which reflect momentary and fairly random lapses in ancillary processes such as lack of attention or memory distortions  and alternative task construal  where participants perceive and interpret the task in a way that differs from the one implied by the normative point of view or the experimenter's perspective
MISC	thus  the way people process information is dependent on their individual processing style but also on contextual factors which change the priority assigned to the different types of attributes
MISC	in the same vein  kahneman  and  frederick  citation  proposed attribute substitution as a processing information model to explain a variety of biases
MISC	according to this model  in an attempt to simplify the decision process  individuals replace consideration of complex attributes  although it might be crucial for the choice at hand  with considerations of simpler attributes which may be correlated with the more relevant ones
MISC	for example  when individuals are required to assess the risk level of an investment portfolio  they often tend to ignore crucial normative attributes such as data about the real statistical correlation between funds  and rely instead on irrelevant attributes which comes more readily to mind such as the difference between the funds' names  citation
MISC	regarding the rational information processing style  the picture seems rather clear
MISC	based on previous research  individuals who are low in rational thinking are assumed to be more prone to commit different types of judgmental biases
MISC	since these people are also more affected by framing i e   the way information is presented  citation  they are more prone to use alternative construal of the tasks
MISC	consequently  they are expected to show seemingly opposite behavioral biases when the identical normative components are set in a different situation
MISC	while biased  behavior is often considered the result of a low tendency for rational  thinking and a high tendency for experiential thinking that replaces  relevant attributes with irrelevant attributes  citation   recent data suggest that in some  situations highly intuitive thinking leads to well adjusted judgments  that take into account the different attributes according to their  importance rather quickly  citation
MISC	these more recent studies  may shed light on the interplay between the rational and experiential  systems
MISC	specifically  highly rational participants tend to engage in  active information search which often leads to the selection of more  relevant attributes during the decision process  citation
MISC	nevertheless  experiential weighting and integrating  which utilizes the  most relevant attributes via high rational thinking  may bear an added  value which lead to less biased decisions for individuals high in experiential  thinking  citation
MISC	decision making often involves choices between risky outcomes
MISC	prospect theory and expected utility theory both posit that individuals balance outcomes and their potentially weighted probability of occurrence  which means that the certainty equivalent of a binary lottery will lie somewhere between the lowest and the highest outcomes
MISC	however  gneezy  list and wu  citation  document cases where individuals value a risky prospect less than its worst possible realization
OWNX	they call this phenomenon the uncertainty effect and demonstrate its existence in various laboratory experiments including real and hypothetical pricing tasks and inter-temporal choice tasks as well as in a field experiment a sportscard market
MISC	the uncertainty effect  however  disappears in within-subject designs and is observed only in lotteries that do not involve cash
MISC	the gneezy  list and wu  citation  study has sparked a small but growing literature examining the robustness of their findings
MISC	for example  sonsino  citation  has found the occurrence of uncertainty effect in an internet-based  within-subject design
MISC	keren and willemsen  citation  argued  however  that gneezy  list and wu's  citation  results were an artifact of poorly understood experimental instructions
MISC	specifically  in a series of experiments  they replaced the lottery with a coin toss and a spinner wheel to clearly define payoff probabilities
MISC	they also added comprehension checks
MISC	their new protocols eliminated the uncertainty effect almost completely
OWNX	on the other hand  simonsohn  citation  argued that the uncertainty effect is neither caused by the fact that gneezy  list and wu's  citation  manipulation of uncertainty was fully confounded by the number of outcomes presented to subjects nor that subjects may had erroneously believed that the lottery could result in a payment of   number 
MISC	instead  he argued that the uncertainty effect occurs as a consequence of direct risk aversion
MISC	direct risk aversion arises from a literal distaste for uncertainty  i e   uncertainty enters directly into people's utility function
MISC	theoretically  gill and stone  citation  have showed that the uncertainty effect can arise in tournaments where two agents are competing to win a fixed monetary prize
MISC	similarly  andreoni and sprenger  citation  argued that the uncertainty effect is not anomalous if certain and uncertain consumption is evaluated with different utility parameters
MISC	they argue that marginal utility for uncertain consumption diminishes more quickly than marginal utility for certain consumption
MISC	because uncertain utility is more concave than certain utility  one can expect a gamble to be valued less than its worst possible outcome
OWNX	we term this effect the overbidding effect
OWNX	in addition to documenting the overbidding effect  we seek to identify the causes of the effect
MISC	it is tempting to attribute the overbidding effect to elements of the value elicitation mechanism
MISC	for example  in kagel and levin's  citation  non-risky induced value experiments  subjects tended to slightly overbid in a second price auction
MISC	in these experiments  subjects are assigned a value  v  and the winner of the auction is paid the difference between his or her value and the second highest bid  which is the price  profit   v - price
MISC	in a second price auction  an individual's weakly dominant strategy is to submit a bid equal to v  but as kagel and levin show  many people submit bids higher than v
MISC	kagel and levin  citation  attributed overbidding to either the dominant bidding strategy not being transparent or to weak learning feedback mechanisms in the second price sealed bid auction
MISC	although this result is often taken as a stylized fact associated with second price auctions  lusk and shogren  citation  document that several more recent induced value studies that focus on all bidders' values not just the market price tend to find behaviour more in-line with theoretical predicted bidding behaviour in the second price auction
OWNX	although subjects in our experiments  overbid   we would expect people's bids to lie somewhere close to the expected payoff  not close to the maximum payoff of the lottery
MISC	stated differently  the overbidding effect observed by kagel and levin  citation  might explain bids slightly higher than the expected value of the lottery but it cannot explain bids in excess of the maximum lottery payout
OWNX	we use an experimental design that varied the amount of training about the auction mechanism and amount of feedback after each round
MISC	on the other hand  the amount of feedback after each round allows us to test whether the mechanism may have induced more competitiveness to the sessions
MISC	in experiment  number   participants played a temporal discounting game that incorporates the logic of a repeated prisoner's-dilemma pd game versus tit-for-tat  choice of one alternative  defection  in pd terminology resulted in a small-immediate reward  choice of the other alternative  cooperation  in pd terminology resulted in a larger reward delayed until the following trial
MISC	the larger-delayed reward was greater for half of the groups than for the other half
MISC	rewards also differed in type across groups  multiples of real nickels  hypothetical nickels  or hypothetical hundred-dollar bills
MISC	all groups significantly increased choice of the larger delayed reward over the  number  trials of the experiment
MISC	over the last  number  trials  cooperation was significantly higher when the difference between larger and smaller hypothetical rewards was greater
MISC	reward type real or hypothetical made no significant difference in cooperation on most measures
MISC	in experiment  number   real and hypothetical rewards were compared in social discounting-the decrease in value to the giver of a reward as social distance increases to the receiver of the reward
MISC	discounting rates for real and hypothetical rewards did not significantly differ
MISC	these results add to the evidence that results of experiments with hypothetical rewards validly apply in everyday life
MISC	in research on choice using hypothetical rewards  participants are asked to imagine the alternatives-to choose as they would if the alternative rewards were real
MISC	such research assumes that participants are successful in this imaginative task
MISC	one potential problem with using hypothetical questions in psychological research is that participants may not be capable of the required imaginary act
MISC	people often cannot predict what they will do in certain situations  an alcoholic may believe in the morning that he will not drink at a party to be held that evening
MISC	but then he may well drink  citation
MISC	even if he is asked to reflect on his behavior at past parties  he may not remember how much he drank  citation
MISC	participants want experimenters to believe that they are altruistic  with hypothetical rewards  it costs nothing to be altruistic
MISC	because of such  demand characteristics   economists and some psychologists have been reluctant to recognize the validity of choices among hypothetical rewards
MISC	reviews of game-theory and decision experiments have found that real monetary rewards are stronger incentives than nominally equivalent hypothetical rewards  citation
MISC	they studied double-or-nothing gambles with all combinations of a positive and negative framing  b small and large rewards  and c hypothetical and real rewards
MISC	they found strong inter-group effects of framing and magnitude of reward  as expected  but choices by participants who imagined a hypothetical gamble did not differ from choices by participants gambling for real money
MISC	moreover  studies comparing delay discounting with real and hypothetical rewards have found both reward types to yield hyperbolic functions and failed to find significant differences in steepness of discounting depending on type of reward  citation
MISC	but  the more evidence that experimental participants choose similarly between lesser amounts of real and hypothetical rewards  the more confidence there will be that participants choosing among larger hypothetical rewards are successfully imagining how they would choose if the rewards were real
MISC	experiment  number  compared real and hypothetical rewards in a prisoner's dilemma pd type game versus tit-for-tat
MISC	in a  number -person pd game  player a and player b each choose between cooperating c and defecting d
MISC	each player receives a reward determined by the combination of both players' choices
MISC	in the case of the  number - number - number - number  reward matrix of figure  number   a player will earn  number    number    number   or  number  reward units  depending on which of the  number  possible choice combinations are chosen
MISC	if both cooperate  each receives a moderately high reward  number  units  if both defect  each receives a moderately low reward  number  units but if one cooperates and the other defects the cooperator receives a very low reward  number  unit while the defector receives a very high reward  number  units
MISC	a strategy  called tit-for-tat  has been found to increase cooperation in repeated pd games  citation
MISC	suppose player-b rigidly plays tit-for-tat  if a cooperates on trial n  b will cooperate on trial n  number   if a defects on trial n  b will defect on trial n  number 
MISC	when b cooperates  a receives  number  units for cooperating or  number  units for defecting  when b defects  a receives only  number  unit for cooperating or  number  units for defecting
MISC	thus  regardless of a's choice  a gets  number  more units when b cooperates than when b defects
MISC	but  if b is rigidly playing tit-for-tat  the only way that b will cooperate is if a previously cooperated
MISC	by cooperating on the present trial  a gives up  number  unit but will gain  number  units on the next trial when b reciprocates
MISC	b's tit-for-tat strategy thus creates a self-control problem for a  a smaller  immediate gain for defecting  number  unit on this trial versus a larger  delayed gain for cooperating  number  units on the next trial
MISC	essentially  if b rigidly plays tit-for-tat  a must choose the lower of two rewards on the present trial cooperate in order to get b to cooperate  b's cooperation in turn allows a to choose between higher rewards on the next trial
MISC	the dashed line of figure  number b shows a's average reward as a function of a's percent cooperation with b playing tit-for-tat
MISC	since b's tit-for-tat behavior is rigidly determined  b's place may be taken by the experimental apparatus-as it was in experiment  number 
MISC	in prior experiments  with a  number - number - number - number  matrix versus tit-for-tat  participants learned to cooperate over repeated trials  citation
MISC	with a  number - number - number - number  matrix  where the delayed reward was  number  units  players learned to cooperate faster and to a higher asymptote than with the  number - number - number - number  matrix  where the delayed reward was  number  units
MISC	as the delay of b's reciprocation time between trials increases or its probability decreases  a's cooperation decreases proportionally  citation
MISC	the computer game played in experiment  number   citation  replicated the pd versus tit-for-tat contingencies but did away with the pretense that there was another player player b making independent choices
MISC	as in the typical pd versus tit-for-tat game  participants had to choose the lower of two available rewards on the present trial  number  rather than  number  or  number  rather than  number  in order to be able to choose between a pair of higher rewards  number  or  number  rather than  number  or  number  on the next trial
MISC	given that  number  the pd versus tit-for-tat is a self-control game   number  self-control has been found to vary inversely with the steepness of an individual's delay discount function  citation   and  number  the steepness of delay discount functions has been found not to be significantly different with real or hypothetical rewards  citation   we expected that type of reward real versus hypothetical nickels would have a weak effect or no effect on cooperation in the present experiment
MISC	whether cooperation would be affected by increasing all hypothetical rewards by a factor of  number   number    number   number    number   number  would depend on whether self-control is a function of the ratio or the difference in amounts of immediate and delayed rewards
MISC	choice experiments with humans  citation  indicate that reward ratios rather than differences count in these situations
OWNX	thus we expected that cooperation would not be significantly affected by increasing all rewards proportionally
MISC	the pd game of experiment  number  is normally a social game where the alternatives are maximization of benefit to oneself versus maximization of benefit to another player
MISC	the tit-for-tat contingency substitutes the participant's own future self for the other player and changes the game to a self-control situation
MISC	experiment  number  studied a true social choice
MISC	participants chose between larger rewards for another person and smaller rewards for themselves
MISC	both experiments tested the efficacy of hypothetical versus real monetary rewards
MISC	 very small but cumulated decreases in food intake may be sufficient to have significant effects  even erasing obesity over a period of years   citation
MISC	items placed at the beginning or the end of the list of their category options were up to twice as popular as when they were placed in the center of the list
MISC	given this effect  placing healthier menu items at the top or bottom of item lists and less healthy ones in their center e g   sugared drinks vs calorie-free drinks should result in some increase in favor of healthier food choices
MISC	obesity is a growing problem throughout the world
MISC	fighting it via dieting is apparently ineffective  citation
MISC	they then suggest that the war on obesity could benefit from nudges  citation   not only from heavy efforts and investments in resources
MISC	nudges are small  cheap  easily implementable and often hardly noticed changes in the choice architecture i e   the manner or setting in which the choice set is presented that do not affect the choice set itself  yet affect the appeal of different options in it
MISC	rozin et al 's nudge to nobesity is very simple  if you want to increase or decrease the popularity of a food item  make it easier or harder to access  respectively
OWNX	in the same spirit  the present paper explores another possible nudge to nobesity
OWNX	we show that placing a food item on a menu at the beginning or the end of its category increases its popularity compared to placing it in the middle
MISC	restaurants present customers with lists of their offerings
MISC	when the menu is displayed in writing  items are presented simultaneously
MISC	when a waiter recites the day's specials  items are presented sequentially
OWNX	our study involved only printed menus
MISC	menu items may be organized in various ways  such as by type e g   soups  salads  etc
MISC	  or according to main ingredients fish dishes  vegetarian dishes  etc
MISC	within each category they are typically listed in vertical ordering
MISC	when designing menus  does this order matter
MISC	one may seek answers from two kinds of sources-the  how to  literature on menu design  and the psychological literature on position effects
MISC	familiar position effects such as primacy and recency refer to stimuli presented sequentially  and their dependent variable is not usually choice
MISC	but the effect called  edge avoidance   citation    centrality preferences   citation    middle bias   citation   or  center-stage effect   citation  refers to choice from among simultaneously presented options-and the various names indicate the typical findings   people choosing from an array of identical options reliably prefer the middle ones   citation
MISC	when items are not identical  the effect's manifestation is that when options are presented in the middle of an array they are chosen more often than when they are presented on its edges
MISC	these studies do not  of course  apply to options for which position may be inherently important  such as theater or airplane seats  skyscraper floors  restaurant tables  or place in queues
MISC	rather they use options for which it is hard to imagine why position would matter  such as  i
MISC	in which of  number  opaque boxes people choose to hide  or seek  a  treasure   citation   ii
MISC	similarly  in what position people place  or guess  answers in multiple-choice tests  citation   iii
MISC	which good they choose from a set of identical  citation  or non-identical  citation  goods offered  iv
MISC	what stall they head for in a public bathroom  citation   etc
MISC	all these studies found that placing an item in the middle  rather than the edges  of the choice set enhanced its popularity
MISC	nisbett and wilson  citation  asked their subjects to consider a linear array of  number  identical pairs of stockings a fact of which their subjects were not aware  and serendipitously found a  pronounced left-to-right position effect  such that the right-most object in the array  which was also the last perused  was heavily over-chosen  p  number -namely   last-is-best 
MISC	in contrast  koppell and steen  citation  analyzed real ballot-voting data that was almost like a controlled study  inasmuch as  the order of candidates' names was rotated by precinct  p  number   and found that  candidates received a greater proportion of the vote when listed first than when listed in any other position  p  number -namely   first-is-best 
MISC	the destination point could not be reached by walking a straight line  but the paths to be chosen from had the same total length and number of turns
MISC	the paths cannot be classified into first  last  or middle  but the possible points of taking the first turn can  and in that sense  respondents preferred the last
MISC	in contrast to all the above-mentioned findings  the restaurant trade publications on menus advocate both edges namely  the first and last as the positions where one should place the items whose popularity one wants to enhance  citation
MISC	moreover  when kincaid and corsun  citation  attempted to put other accepted truths regarding  the impact of menu layout on item sales  to an empirical test  their title question   are consultants blowing smoke
MISC	  p  number   was answered in the affirmative
OWNX	however  since they did not study  edge bias  specifically  we have no direct menu results to either contrast with or add to the  edge avoidance  we reported above
OWNX	in the present study  therefore  we did not hypothesize a bias either in favor of or against middle positioned items  but rather checked whether one exists  using  number -tailed significance testing
MISC	several studies propose that exemplar retrieval contributes to multi-attribute decisions
MISC	the authors have proposed a process theory enabling a priori predictions of what cognitive representations people use as input to their judgment process  citation
MISC	according to sigma  exemplar retrieval is a back-up system when the task does not allow for additive and linear abstraction and integration of cue-criterion knowledge e g   when the task is non-additive
MISC	an important question is to what extent such shifts occur spontaneously as part of automatic procedures  such as error-minimization with the delta rule  or if they are controlled strategy shifts contingent on the ability to identify a sufficiently successful judgment strategy
OWNX	in this article data are reviewed that demonstrate a shift between exemplar memory and cue abstraction  as well as data where the expected shift does not occur
MISC	exemplar models have proven particularly successful for describing categorization learning and categorical decisions  citation
MISC	in the last years  researchers have shown interest in studying exemplar-based reasoning as a basis for other sorts of judgments and decisions  citation
MISC	it has thus been increasingly acknowledged that many everyday judgments  like  for example  a diagnosis of a patient  or the decision to hire a job candidate or to purchase a car may  at least in part  be driven by the retrieval of concrete  similar previous examples
MISC	despite this interest  the nature of the interaction between exemplar memory and other processes  such as rule-based processes  has received relatively little empirical scrutiny
MISC	his medium score on the national high school economy exam should also be associated with a high grade  since that exam is very difficult
MISC	this exemplifies a judgment process based on abstracted knowledge of the relations between individual cues the tests and their difficulty and the criterion the final grade
MISC	for lisa  on the other hand  the teacher might realize that her test results are very similar to robin's
MISC	this illustrates a judgment based on a similar concrete exemplar
OWNX	although these examples are highly simplified  we can probably all agree that we have at times engaged in both sorts of processes
MISC	what is less clear  and has received relatively little attention in judgment and decision research  are what task properties invite the one or the other process  and what processes that instigate shifts between the processes
MISC	the possibility that exemplar memory interacts with rule-based processes has been modeled in the context of  for example  classification learning  citation   and arithmetic learning  citation
MISC	without claiming identity  these models share the assumption that a transition from one process to another occurs automatically at an item-based level  either as a side-effect of obligatory  accumulative encoding  citation  or as implemented by an error-driven learning rule typical of connectionist models  citation
MISC	a viable alternative  however  is that the shifts are hypothesis-driven  involving controlled and sequential tests of strategies  sustained over a period of trials  citation
MISC	according to this view  the choice of the one rather than the other strategy is the result of an active and effortful process of problem solving and contingent on the perceived success of the strategy
OWNX	the aim of this article is to review data on multiple-cue judgment  citation  that demonstrate abilities to shift between the processes  as well as striking and stubborn inabilities to make appropriate shifts
MISC	excess choice has previously been shown to have detrimental effects on decisions about consumer products
MISC	as the number of options increases  people are more likely to put off making an active choice i e   defer and show less satisfaction with any purchase actually made
OWNX	we extend this line of enquiry to choosing a charitable organisation to volunteer for
MISC	the issue is important because the number of voluntary organisations is enormous and the impact of such a decision may be greater than for consumer decisions in terms of time commitment and benefits to the volunteer and society
MISC	study  number  asked students to examine a real volunteering website and record how many organisations they considered  decision difficulty and whether or not they would like to sign up for a chosen organisation or prefer to defer a decision
MISC	study  number  presented either a relatively small  number  or large  number  choice set of hypothetical organisations and measured deferment likelihood and decision difficulty
MISC	in both studies the more options considered  the greater the likelihood to defer
MISC	this effect was mediated by decision difficulty
MISC	this research is the first to find that detrimental effects of excess choice extend to volunteering
MISC	western societies place great value on the provision of extensive choice  citation
MISC	choice  it is argued  enhances the ability to match individual preferences to outcomes  citation   is associated with feelings of personal autonomy and well-being  citation   and people tend to react negatively when choice is restricted  citation
MISC	however  the benefits of extensive choice need to be considered alongside potential costs
MISC	research suggests  for instance  that too much choice may encourage confusion and choice deferment  citation  as well as a reduction in satisfaction with chosen options  citation
MISC	moreover  economic theory has long recognised that as options become more similar the opportunity costs of the next best alternative foregone also rise
MISC	this tension between wanting more options but finding them difficult to deal with has been referred to as the paradox of choice  citation
MISC	the aim of the current research was to investigate whether extensive choice undermines decision making with respect to a potentially more meaningful decision context  namely choosing an organisation to volunteer for
MISC	volunteering one's time without concern for financial gain is a serious time commitment for many individuals  which has been linked to a range of volunteer benefits such as greater life satisfaction  improved health  skill development and better job prospects  citation   as well as obvious benefits for others
MISC	consequently  the implications for the individual of deciding which organisation to volunteer for are potentially much larger than for many of the consumer contexts explored previously
MISC	like many of these consumer contexts  however  the charity and volunteer sector is one where excess choice abounds
MISC	for example  number   number  charities are registered in the uk alone  citation
MISC	moreover  the national centre for social research and the institute for volunteering research  citation  estimates that the economic benefit of uk volunteering is around   xa number   number  billion annually
MISC	the current uk government has placed increased volunteering at the heart of its big society agenda  citation
MISC	if this plethora of organisations is indeed detrimental for volunteer recruitment this could have a major effect on service delivery and the success of the big society and other similar initiatives
MISC	understanding how people make decisions about selecting volunteer organisations and how best to structure these choices to aid people's decision making could therefore have considerable policy implications
MISC	for research into volunteer recruitment  students are a very important population to investigate
MISC	this is an age and stage of life when many people begin volunteering for the first time
MISC	key motivations include wanting to learn new skills  number   number  percent  and to gain experience for their future career  citation
MISC	the contribution to the economy is estimated to be around   xa number   number  million pounds  citation
MISC	importantly students also tend to continue volunteering after leaving college
MISC	in the us  college graduates were more likely to volunteer  number   number  percent  than people without college experience  number   number  percent  and were also more likely to still be volunteering later in life  citation
MISC	the present studies focus on the potential of extensive choice to increase the likelihood that individuals will put off making an immediate decision and instead defer a decision to later
MISC	given the general propensity not to revisit deferred decisions  citation  this could have important implications for volunteer recruitment
MISC	the association between the number of options considered and deferment likelihood was then tested
OWNX	in two studies we investigated the effects of numeracy and presentation format on the underlying affective and cognitive mechanisms of donation decisions
MISC	in study  number   participants were presented with information about a victim in need  either in a frequency format or in a percentage format
OWNX	in study  number   we manipulated the identifiability and number of target victims
OWNX	our results demonstrate that donations of individuals lower in numeracy were more susceptible to changes in numeric presentation format than those higher in numeracy
MISC	importantly  the underlying mechanisms for donations differed by numeracy
MISC	in reports of the effects of natural and man-made catastrophes e g   famines  floods  tsunamis  and wars  it is common to encounter statistics about the number of human lives affected
MISC	for example  the earthquake in haiti on january  number    number  affected  number  million people  of which approximately  number   number  lost their lives  citation  and an estimated  number   number  families were left homeless  citation
MISC	although it may be difficult to truly comprehend the scope of such tragedies  citation   numerical figures are typically used to convey the enormity of suffering
MISC	humanitarian aid organizations likewise use numerical information to communicate the needs of the victims and to entice benefactors to make financial contributions
MISC	potential donors are expected to understand and use such numerical information when deciding whether to support a humanitarian aid project
MISC	however  comprehension and use of this information may differ depending on how it is presented and who the potential donor is
MISC	a wise decider d uses the contents of his mind fully  accurately and efficiently
MISC	however  the most practical way for d to approximate his ideal may not be with models that embody those norms  i e   with applied decision theory adt
MISC	in practice  adt can represent only some of d's judgments and those imperfectly
MISC	quite different decision aid  including intuition  pattern recognition and cognitive vigilance especially combined  typically outperform feasible adt models-with some notable exceptions
MISC	however  decision theory training benefits d's informal decisions
MISC	adt  both formal and informal  should become increasingly useful and widespread  as technical  cultural and institutional impediments are overcome
MISC	in the  number s  a new analytic technology  applied decision theory adt-also known as  decision analysis -promised to revolutionize decision practice  citation
MISC	i have spent a long career trying to realize that promise
MISC	the method builds on the approach of smith and batchelder  citation
MISC	preference reversals are counted between all pairs of repetitions
MISC	the variance of these preference reversals between all pairs of repetitions is then calculated
MISC	data of regenwetter  dana  and davis-stober  citation  are reanalyzed by this method
MISC	eight of  number  subjects showed significant deviations from the independence assumptions by one or both of these tests  which is significantly more than expected by chance
MISC	regenwetter  dana  and davis-stober  citation  proposed a solution to the problem of testing whether choice data satisfy or violate transitivity of preference
MISC	the model was used to analyze a replication of tversky's  citation  study that had reported systematic violations of transitivity of preference  citation
MISC	reanalysis via this iid mixture model of new data concluded that transitivity can be retained
MISC	if this assumption is violated  the method of regenwetter et al citation  might lead to wrong conclusions regarding the tests of structural properties
MISC	further  the violations of these assumptions can be analyzed by a more detailed analysis of individual responses to choice problems rather than by focusing on averaged binary choice proportions
MISC	these methods allow tests of assumptions of the regenwetter  et al citation  approach against violations that would occur if a person were to change preferences during a study
MISC	hypothetical examples illustrated cases in which the method of regenwetter  et al citation  might lead to the conclusion that transitivity was satisfied  even when a more detailed analysis showed that the data contained systematic violations of both iid and transitivity
MISC	regenwetter  dana  davis-stober  and guo  citation  argued that it would be difficult to collect enough data to provide a complete test of all iid assumptions  as proposed by birnbaum  citation
MISC	nevertheless  this note shows that by building on the approach of smith and batchelder  citation   it is possible to test iid assumptions even in small studies such as that of regenwetter  et al citation
MISC	most prior research on the compromise effect has focused on single rather than multiple choices
OWNX	furthermore  we propose that the need for justification and an optimal stimulation level moderate the relationship between the number of purchase items and the compromise effect
MISC	these proposed hypotheses are supported by results from three experiments
MISC	consumers are motivated to minimize expected losses and to resolve decision conflicts in their decision-making process  citation
MISC	rather  they are more likely to choose a middle option  because it may be seen as the least extreme choice
MISC	this choice strategy prevents consumers from having to give up any favorable attributes of the other products  citation
MISC	accordingly  a compromise effect occurs when the likelihood that one option will be chosen over its alternative is enhanced by the introduction of a third option  which makes first option appear as the middle option  citation
MISC	the concept of the compromise effect has been shown to be theoretically and practically robust in many fields  including business-to-business  citation   group decision making  citation   technology markets  citation   and culture difference  citation
MISC	most prior research on the compromise effect has focused on the choice of a single unit during the purchase of a specific product and has largely ignored multiple-unit purchase decisions
MISC	yet consumers often purchase multiple units in a product category on a single occasion
MISC	for instance  they may buy several bottles of orange juice at once
MISC	given a choice among three available brands of juice-a  b  and c  which have high trade-off attributes-and assuming that brand b is the middle option  will the purchase quantity change their choice behavior in favor of the middle option
MISC	specifically  will they buy the middle compromise option as predicted by compromise effect theory  or will they purchase every available option
MISC	as the purchase quantity increases  consumers may find that choosing only one option for multiple units may ironically heighten the decision risk instead of reducing it  therefore  they may forfeit their choice of the compromise option in favor of a strategy of diversification
MISC	one distinct aspect of purchasing multiple units with several available alternatives is that it enables consumers to distribute their choices among different options
MISC	the distributability of choices among several options allows consumers to diversify associated risks and to obtain satisfaction from buying a variety of options
MISC	people  as predicted by balance theory  citation   are apt to achieve a state of balance  order  and harmony in their lives
MISC	hence  the compromise effect may be different for a multiple-unit purchase than for a single-unit purchase
MISC	the variety-seeking tendency may emerge when people need to minimize expected losses  citation   to resolve decision conflicts  citation   and to save their efforts  citation
MISC	since the variety-seeking tendency induces people to assign their choice of multiple units among the available alternatives  it may weaken the compromise effect
MISC	past research has suggested that the purchase quantity may affect the compromise effect  because people may prefer to make choices to minimize losses and resolve inner conflicts when making multiple choice decisions  citation
MISC	consumers sometimes need to provide reasons for their choices
MISC	the need for justification is assumed to exercise a positive influence on the compromise effect  because the focus of the decision shifts from a choice of good options to choice of good reason for selecting that option
MISC	the compromise option seems logical when purchasing a single unit  but it may not seem plausible for choosing only the compromise alternative for all of the multiple units
MISC	hence  having to make several choices among multiple options weakens or offsets the positive impact of decision justification
MISC	finally  the availability of a variety of alternatives is advantageous to consumers' choices as far as their optimal stimulation level osl is concerned
MISC	osl refers to the level of stimulation that consumers want to reach in response to environmental stimuli  citation
MISC	when the stimulation received from diversity  novelty  ambiguity  or complexity is below the optimal level  people attempt to increase the stimulation  when it is above the optimal level  they are inclined to reduce it
MISC	therefore  if choosing the compromise option for all multiple units cannot provide enough stimulation for consumers  they may allocate some of the purchased units to alternatives other than the compromise one
MISC	in sum  this study explores how purchase quantity affects the compromise effect
OWNX	furthermore  we suggest that the impact of the compromise effect is mediated by the balance tendency  which is computed with a formula of balance index derived from the concept of balance deviation
MISC	the tempting fate effect is that the probability of a fateful outcome is deemed higher following an action that  tempts  the outcome than in the absence of such an action
MISC	causal frames require that the action make a difference to an outcome and that the action precedes the outcome
MISC	if an illusion of control modulates the reluctance to tempt fate  then actions that make a difference to well-being and that occur prior to the outcome should tempt fate most strongly
OWNX	in experiments  number - number  we varied whether the action makes a difference and the temporal order of action and outcome
MISC	in experiment  number  we tested whether an action can tempt fate if all outcomes are negative
MISC	risen and gilovich  citation  have shown that taking an action or making a decision that presupposes a certain state of the world can make the opposite state seem more likely  even when the action or decision has no real causal impact
MISC	for example  people judge that leaving one's umbrella at home increases the probability that it will rain
MISC	risen and gilovich argue that this reluctance to tempt fate occurs because an action that presupposes a good outcome leads to anticipated regret and therefore draws attention disproportionally to the negative outcome
MISC	the negative outcome then seems more likely because it is more available
OWNX	our claim is that it is not merely the availability of the bad outcome that makes it seem more likely
OWNX	our use of the term  control  denotes a relation between variables  not states of variables
MISC	an agent will feel control over an outcome only if the agent believes at some level that his or her action has a causal relation to the outcome
MISC	causality imposes certain requirements on relations between actions and outcomes
MISC	first  for an action to cause an outcome  the action must make a difference to the outcome  citation
MISC	second  the action must precede the outcome  citation
MISC	by definition  fate-tempting actions have no real causal impact on the outcome in question  bringing or leaving an umbrella does not influence whether it will rain
MISC	however such actions can affect well-being in a way that depends on the uncontrolled outcome
MISC	for instance  the decision to leave the umbrella at home and the weather jointly determine whether one gets wet
MISC	in contrast  actions that do not directly influence well-being will not seem to tempt fate
OWNX	we use the term  make-a-difference  to denote a choice that interacts with the uncontrolled outcome to determine well-being
MISC	temporal priority is another fundamental property of causal relations and one that people are highly sensitive to  citation
MISC	morris  sim  and girotto  citation  used this principle to provide evidence that an illusion of control mediated choices in a prisoner's dilemma game
MISC	they compared behavior in games where the opponent had already chosen but what they chose was unknown to cases where the opponent had not chosen yet
MISC	people were more likely to cooperate if their opponent had not chosen yet even though their own choice was unknown to the opponent
MISC	this suggests that decision-making was influenced by a belief at some level that one's choice could influence the opponent even though it was unknown to him or her  citation
MISC	similarly we hypothesized that the feeling of tempting fate will be attenuated if the outcome has already been determined  even if one lacks knowledge of the outcome
OWNX	in the first study we manipulated both whether the choice makes a difference and the temporal order of outcome and decision to test this prediction
MISC	the second study replicated the first using different wording to rule out an alternative explanation
MISC	the third study extended the manipulation to a scenario adapted from risen and gilovich  citation
OWNX	we hypothesize that donations increase with the number of recipients  albeit at a decreasing rate  and reflect donors' knowledge of the recipients
MISC	in two experiments  respondents indicated how they would donate lottery winnings of  number  euros
MISC	results showed  first  that more was donated to non-governmental organizations and campaigns that respondents knew better
MISC	second  total donations increased with the number of recipients albeit at a decreasing rate
MISC	third  when limited to giving to only one of multiple alternatives  donors gave less than when this restriction did not apply
MISC	fourth  variability of donations can both increase and decrease with the number of potential recipients
OWNX	we comment on theoretical and practical implications as well as suggesting issues for future research
MISC	recently  much literature has highlighted the importance of numbers of alternatives in choice
MISC	this can be considered from two perspectives
MISC	for example  studies have documented differential satisfaction with choice for decisions involving pens  citation   pension plans  citation   gift boxes  citation   and wines  citation
MISC	moreover  a recent meta-analysis suggests that the magnitude of effects depends on preconditions  choice moderators and the contexts in which decisions are made  citation
MISC	the focus in the second perspective is on what happens when people allocate resources across different numbers of alternatives  citation
MISC	both of these issues are important from theoretical and practical viewpoints
MISC	for example  when attempting to maximize donations  ngos might consider whether donors perceive them as belonging to small or large subsets of potential recipients
MISC	at the same time  ngos often seek funds for different campaigns and it is important to know how the number and presentation of campaigns affect total donations
OWNX	we report two experiments
OWNX	in the first  we explore effects when donors allocate funds across different numbers of ngos
OWNX	in the second  we investigate what happens when a single ngo solicits contributions for different numbers of campaigns
MISC	specifically  these tend to become less egalitarian in the case of ngos but more so in the case of campaigns
OWNX	in the second experiment  we also investigate the use of  drop down  menus in donation interfaces for soliciting donations to specific campaigns
MISC	when  as in current practice  choice is limited to one of several alternatives  contributions are lower than when this restriction does not apply
MISC	according to recent dual-process theories  interpersonal trust is influenced by both impulsive and deliberative processes
MISC	the present research explores the determinants of deliberative trust  investigating how trust decisions are affected by the availability of cognitive resources
MISC	past research has shown that self-control has extensive effects on social behavior and decision making
OWNX	across two studies  we find no direct link between self-control and trust
MISC	instead  self-control affects trust indirectly by influencing the level of effort in decision making
MISC	poor self-control due to experimental depletion or trait-based differences predicts adherence to the default-the response that requires the least effort
MISC	interpersonal trust plays an important role in myriad contexts  from economic exchanges and organizational settings to friendships and romantic relationships  citation
MISC	the factors that influence trust can vary significantly across these domains  citation
MISC	to account for this variance  past research has noted the differences between the emotional and cognitive aspects of trust  citation
MISC	more recently  murray and colleagues  citation  proposed a dual-process model of trust  separating trust into impulsive and deliberative components
MISC	the deliberative aspect of trust often depends on complex considerations
MISC	a potential trustor might consider the risk of the situation  as well as the ability  benevolence  and integrity of the trusted party  citation
MISC	ultimately  the trustor has to decide if  given the parameters of the situation  trusting is worth the risk
MISC	if the trustor intends to be thorough about this decision  the process could require a significant investment of time and effort
MISC	the present research investigates how trust decisions change when the ability to deliberate is compromised
MISC	a recent study indicates that acute stress affects moral decision making youssef et al   in press
MISC	the current study examines whether results can be replicated using a different kind of stressor and a different kind of stress measurement
MISC	another group of  number  participants was tested in a control condition
MISC	all participants performed a moral decision-making task describing moral dilemmas
MISC	these dilemmas were either personal or impersonal and each offered a utilitarian and a non-utilitarian option
MISC	acutely stressed participants  compared to control participants  made fewer utilitarian judgments and needed longer for making a decision
MISC	individual physiological stress response was related to fewer utilitarian judgments
MISC	recent research postulates that moral decision making is influenced by automatic emotional responses and controlled cognitive processes  citation
MISC	there is also growing evidence that stress affects decision making in neuropsychological tasks  citation  and moral decision making  citation
MISC	the trolley problem is subdivided into the switch dilemma and the footbridge dilemma
MISC	in the switch dilemma  people have to judge whether it is morally acceptable to divert a runaway trolley onto a side track  where it will kill only one person whereas five other people are being saved
MISC	in the footbridge dilemma  the only way to save five people from the runaway trolley is to push someone off a footbridge onto the railway-which will stop the trolley but will inevitably kill the person being pushed
MISC	the decision to sacrifice one person in order to save the lives of a group of people is called utilitarian because it maximizes the overall benefit amongst all the individuals involved
MISC	according to several authors  citation   utilitarian judgments are particularly related to controlled cognitive processes  whereas non-utilitarian judgments are particularly related to automatic emotional responses
MISC	most people deliver a utilitarian judgment in the switch dilemma but not in the footbridge dilemma  because the footbridge dilemma is perceived as emotionally more aversive and it entails high personal involvement
MISC	dilemmas such as the footbridge dilemma are termed personal because the agent has to take direct action by pushing an individual off the bridge  dilemmas such as the switch dilemma  in which an existing threat is deflected by the agent  are termed impersonal
MISC	response latencies for making a decision differ with respect to the kind of dilemma and the kind of choice  in personal dilemmas  participants typically need longer to make a utilitarian judgment than a non-utilitarian judgment
MISC	these results emphasize the conflict between spontaneous emotional decisions not to be the direct agent of someone's death and deliberative utilitarian judgment maximizing the overall profit  citation
MISC	as mentioned before  moral dilemmas can elicit stress responses  citation
MISC	but then  there is also evidence that stress affects simple  non-moral decision making which can be measured with neuropsychological gambling tasks such as the iowa gambling task  citation  or the game of dice task  citation
MISC	task performance is based on emotional learning processes such as processing the feedback of gains and losses from previous trials or strategy application such as calculating the most advantageous decisions
MISC	stress is related to decision making that leads to disadvantageous results in the long run  and individual stress responses are related to disadvantageous decisions  citation
MISC	a recent study investigated moral decisions after exposure to a well known psychosocial stress task youssef et al   in press using cortisol measures as stress indicator
MISC	participants were either exposed to the trier social stress test  citation  in which participants have to deliver a speech and have to solve an arithmetic task in front of a committee or a control condition
MISC	subsequently they responded to a subset of the aforementioned moral dilemmas developed by greene et al citation  that were either personal or impersonal  each offering a utilitarian and a non-utilitarian decision alternative
MISC	youssef et al found that participants exposed to stress made fewer utilitarian judgments in personal dilemmas and that the individual stress response was negatively related to the number of utilitarian judgments
MISC	they concluded that stress inhibited cognitive control processes that are necessary for making utilitarian judgments
MISC	based on this theoretical and empirical background  the current study aimed to replicate and generalize the significant findings of youssef et al with a different kind of stressor  i e   a cover-story of an anticipated speech  citation  and a different kind of stress measurement  i e   heart rate
MISC	both heart rate and cortisol levels are established stress indicators  heart rate is associated with the fast-reacting neural path  also referred to as the sympathetic adrenomedullary system  citation  and cortisol reactions are associated with the slower hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis  citation
MISC	the trier social stress test has been shown to activate both systems  citation  and the anticipated speech has been shown to activate the sympathetic adrenomedullary system and-to a lesser degree-the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis  too  citation
OWNX	our study was created to generalize results yielded by youssef et al with different methods
OWNX	we introduce the berlin numeracy test  a new psychometrically sound instrument that quickly assesses statistical numeracy and risk literacy

MISC	the online forum also provides interactive content for public outreach and education  and offers a recommendation system for test format selection
MISC	mathematics skills are among the most influential educational factors contributing to economic prosperity in industrialized countries  citation
MISC	the more basic levels of numeracy are concerned with the  real number line  time  measurement  and estimation  whereas higher levels focus on  an understanding of ratio concepts  notably fractions  proportions  percentages  and probabilities   citation
MISC	much of the research on numeracy has involved assessment of a wide range of mathematical skills among large and diverse samples
MISC	more recently  however  research and theory in the decision sciences has focused on a subset of numeracy that is important for informed and accurate risky decision making-i e   statistical numeracy  citation
MISC	these statistical aspects of numeracy are key features of risk assessment in business and engineering  citation   and play central roles in health risk quantification and communication  citation
MISC	in these ways and others  statistical numeracy is one factor that gives rise to risk literacy-i e   the ability to accurately interpret and act on information about risk
MISC	indeed  statistical numeracy has been shown to be a predictor of decision strategies  affective reactions  comprehension and normative choices across many risky economic  health  and consumer decisions  citation
MISC	efforts to measure individual differences in statistical numeracy and risk literacy come primarily in three forms
MISC	some research examines risky decisions in relation to individual differences in overall educational attainment  cognitive abilities  or cognitive styles  citation
MISC	other research primarily focusing on clinical and health domains has developed a valid subjective instrument for self-reported estimations of numeracy  citation
MISC	most common  however  is the use of objective performance measures of numeracy-i e   psychometric tests  citation
OWNX	we then introduce a new test of statistical numeracy and risk literacy-i e   the berlin numeracy test
MISC	the berlin numeracy test can be used in multiple formats i e   computer adaptive  paper-and-pencil  multiple choice  single-item median-split  providing a fast  valid  and reliable tool for research  assessment  and public outreach
OWNX	specifically  we show that the new test offers unique predictive validity for comprehension of everyday risks beyond other cognitive ability and numeracy tests e g   cognitive reflection  working memory span  and fluid intelligence
OWNX	furthermore  we show that the berlin numeracy test dramatically improves psychometric discriminability among highly-educated individuals e g   college students and graduates  medical professionals  across diverse cultures and different languages
MISC	the assumption that people possess a repertoire of strategies to solve the inference problems they face has been made repeatedly
MISC	this learning process is modeled with the strategy selection learning ssl theory  which assumes that people develop subjective expectancies for the strategies they have
MISC	they select strategies proportional to their expectancies  which are updated on the basis of experience
MISC	for the study by newell  weston  and shanks  citation  it can be shown that people did not anticipate the success of a strategy from the beginning of the experiment
MISC	for the second study  by broder and schiffer  citation   the ssl theory is able to provide an explanation for why participants only slowly adapted to new environments in a dynamic inference situation
OWNX	the reanalysis of the previous studies illustrates the importance of learning for probabilistic inferences
MISC	different strategies can be applied to make these inferences  such as integrating all available information to predict the criterion
MISC	in fact  many researchers have argued that people are equipped with a repertoire of different cognitive strategies for making judgments and decisions  citation
OWNX	do people apply different strategies for solving probabilistic inferences
MISC	and if so  how do they select from their strategy repertoire
MISC	the cost-benefit approach to strategy selection argues that people trade off the strategies' anticipated costs and benefits
MISC	in contrast  i will argue that selection is achieved via learning-that is  people learn the success and failure of strategies through experience and select a strategy based on past success
MISC	recent studies have identified the uncertainty effect ue  whereby risky prospects e g   a binary lottery that offers either a   number  or   number  gift certificate are valued less than their worst possible outcome a   number  certificate
MISC	this effect has been proposed to result from  direct risk-aversion  which posits that the mere uncertainty of a lottery directly decreases its value
MISC	however  this effect may also be driven by the potential disappointment inherent in not receiving the better of the two outcomes disappointment aversion  or the mere fact that the risky prospect is referred to as a  lottery 
MISC	specifically  the results of experiment  number  indicate that the ue is observed even when the values of the two lottery outcomes are similar  or even identical
MISC	experiment  number  further replicates the ue in a context in which the word  lottery  is never used a company promotional
MISC	these results are consistent with a direct risk-aversion mechanism  citation  and suggest that the ue obtains across a number of different contexts
MISC	recent studies have identified the following peculiar effect  individuals are willing to pay significantly less for a binary lottery that offers either a   number  or   number  gift certificate with equal probability than they are for a   number  gift certificate alone  citation
MISC	this uncertainty effect ue is not only counterintuitive  it also presents an important challenge to current theories of risk-aversion  which arrive at risk-aversion indirectly through the shape of the utility function and predict that risky prospects should be valued no lower than the value of their worst possible outcome  citation
MISC	indeed  although the disutility of gambling has been alluded to in the literature  it has generally been avoided in formal models because it implies unpalatable patterns such as the violation of internality  citation
MISC	specifically  the ue was replicated for non-monetary outcomes e g   the number of minutes one is willing to work on a boring task  studies using choice rather than willingness to pay wtp  e g     number  for sure vs a  number   number  lottery offering either a   number  or   number  gift certificate  and in real world situations for actual goods
MISC	by ruling out a number of plausible alternative explanations  the authors interpret the ue as resulting from a  direct risk-aversion  mechanism  which posits that uncertainty per se directly decreases the utility of risky prospects
MISC	in other words  it is the mere uncertainty about which outcome one will receive that makes the lottery less valuable
MISC	in support of the direct risk-aversion mechanism  simonsohn  citation  built on the original finding of gneezy et al citation  by ruling out two additional alternative explanations for the ue
MISC	first  simonsohn  citation  found that the ue was observed even when participants in the certainty condition   number  for sure were aware of the better outcome   number   which rules out the possibility that the mere awareness of the better outcome may devalue the worse one
MISC	second  he demonstrated that the majority of participants understood the instructions and that the ue was not caused by the few who did not  which rules out the possibility that this effect is observed simply because participants misunderstand the task  citation
MISC	on this basis  simonsohn  citation  similarly concluded that aversion to uncertainty per se i e   direct risk-aversion is likely responsible for the ue
MISC	there are  however  at least two remaining alternative explanations for the ue  which have been unaddressed by previous research
MISC	the first involves  disappointment aversion -that is  people may value lotteries less because of the potential disappointment inherent in not receiving the better of the two outcomes  citation
MISC	for example  the   number  won in a lottery may seem worse than   number  guaranteed  because an individual knows they did not receive   number 
MISC	thus  the ue may result from the discrepancy in values between the better and worse outcomes  rather than from the uncertainty of the lottery itself
MISC	this alternative explanation can be distinguished experimentally from a  direct risk-aversion  mechanism by manipulating the value of the better outcome
MISC	according to bell's  citation  and loomes  and  sugden's  citation  models of disappointment  the amount of disappointment should be zero when both outcomes are equivalent  and increase monotonically in their difference
MISC	consequently  if the ue is driven by the anticipated disappointment inherent in not receiving the better of the two outcomes  citation   this effect should be eliminated or at least attenuated when the lottery outcomes are equivalent in their perceived value e g   a lottery for one of two bookstore gift certificates  each worth   number 
MISC	if  however  the ue arises solely from the mere uncertainty about which outcome one will receive  then the effect should persist despite the equivalent values
MISC	a second plausible explanation for the ue may be that participants are willing to pay less for the lottery because they just have a general aversion to the term  lottery 
MISC	this might be the case because some people consider such activities immoral and against their beliefs  citation
MISC	moreover  lotteries such as the state lotto are typically low-probability gambles with an expected value that is less than the price of entry into the lottery
MISC	as a result  participants may be suspicious of the term  lottery  because  in the real world  such offers typically signal prospects with negative expected value
MISC	slowing climate change will almost certainly require a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions  but agreement on who should reduce emissions by how much is difficult  in part because of the self-serving bias-the tendency to believe that what is beneficial to oneself is also fair
OWNX	conducting surveys among college students in the united states and china  we show that each of these groups displays a nationalistic self-serving bias in judgments of a fair distribution of economic burdens resulting from mitigation
OWNX	our research reveals that the self-serving bias plays a major role in the difficulty of obtaining agreement on how to implement emissions reductions
MISC	that is  the disagreement over what constitutes fair climate policy does not appear to be due to cross-national differences in what constitutes a fair distribution of burdens
MISC	interventions to mitigate the self-serving bias may facilitate agreement
MISC	although debate continues about technical and scientific issues surrounding climate change  the human dimensions of the problem pose significant impediments to developing and implementing solutions to mitigate its impact
MISC	slowing climate change will almost certainly require a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions  but agreeing upon who should reduce emissions by how much has thus far proven an intractable problem
MISC	despite longstanding agreement that combating anthropogenic climate change is a serious issue that necessitates international cooperation  citation   failures such as occurred in copenhagen in  citation  show that nations are unable to agree on what constitutes a fair sharing of the emissions reduction burden  citation
AIMX	in this paper we show that the difficulty of reaching agreement is  in part  due to the self-serving bias-the pervasive tendency to believe that what is beneficial to oneself is also fair
MISC	alternatively  one might consider the social dilemma structure of the problem  citation  or other strategic concerns  citation  to be the largest obstacles in combating climate change
MISC	in particular  a pre-condition for getting parties to agree to self-sacrifice in pursuit of a collective solution is to reach an agreement regarding the fair distribution of burdens
MISC	the countries that take part in climate change negotiations differ on myriad dimensions of potential relevance to a fair assignment of burdens  including their levels of past and projected emissions  the costs of mitigation  and the benefits obtained by successfully addressing the problem
MISC	research on the self-serving bias  citation  shows that asymmetries between parties on dimensions relevant to a negotiation contribute to the bias  because people place greater weight on dimensions that support a settlement that is more beneficial to themselves  citation
MISC	moreover  because negotiators are averse to accepting settlements that are even slightly below what they perceive to be fair  citation   and because the self-serving bias leads to incongruous perceptions of fairness  there is often no settlement upon which all parties will agree  even when large joint gains are available from agreement
MISC	to illustrate the self-serving selection of fairness norms  consider the following study by van avermaet  citation
MISC	subjects filled out questionnaires and were then given money which was to pay themselves as well as another person in the study for their work
MISC	if told that the other person was given half the amount of time to work and completed half as many questionnaires  subjects kept on average two-thirds of the money  an allocation proportional to both the time spent and work done
MISC	but if the other person was given twice as long and completed twice the number of questionnaires  subjects instead chose the norm of equal division and kept half the money for themselves
MISC	and finally  subjects tended to keep more than half the money in both the case where the other person was given twice as much time and filled out half as many questionnaires and the opposite case half the time and twice the questionnaires
MISC	this indicates that subjects chose time spent or work completed as the fair payment criterion depending on which was in their own favor
MISC	as for which parties prefer which policies  lange et al citation  show that selections of fairness criteria by agents involved in international climate policy tend to correspond to their material self-interest
MISC	furthermore  agents are more likely to believe that self-interest influenced other parties' selections of fairness criteria than to believe they themselves were so influenced
MISC	in the domain of price fairness  chinese consumers consider their own price more unfair if a friend was given a better price than if a stranger was given a better price  while americans are less sensitive to this distinction  citation
MISC	gao  number  found that chinese were more tolerant of the use of market power than european cultures
MISC	one general pattern is that chinese judgments of fairness tend to be more context dependent than those of americans
MISC	to the extent that fairness judgments influence negotiation positions  disentangling the role of self-serving bias may give hints as to the sort of interventions that can most effectively facilitate agreement
MISC	the veil of ignorance is a judgment of social justice fairness made by people who do not know their own interests because they do not know what role they will be assigned
MISC	a classic application of the veil of ignorance is an indictment of slavery based on the observation that few would endorse the institution if they were unaware of whether they were the ones who would be enslaved
OWNX	we presented subjects with graphs that displayed current and projected per capita gdp or income of two countries or farmers  in one scenario
MISC	the different possible divisions could be altered dynamically with a slider that was controlled by the subject figure  number   which led to shifts in per capita income over time for both parties
MISC	subjects could move the slider between one extreme that placed all burdens on one party and the other extreme that placed all burdens on the other party  until they found the division of sacrifice that they deemed most fair
OWNX	we randomly assigned students from the united states and china to one of three scenarios that varied the degree to which they were aware of their own national interests-i e   were behind the veil of ignorance
MISC	a second scenario disguised the countries using the generic labels  country a  and  country b   and also altered the nature of the environmental problem so subjects would be unlikely to realize that it was about climate change
MISC	a third scenario disguised the problem even further  casting it as a negotiation between two neighboring farmers
OWNX	although the scenarios differed on multiple dimensions  the relative economic consequences of shifting burdens between the parties were identical in all three
AIMX	our contribution is to demonstrate a simple experimental procedure that can isolate the effect of self-serving bias from the possible effects of cultural differences in perceptions of fairness
OWNX	our findings also suggest that interventions that eliminate the self-serving bias in international climate policy negotiations may be of tremendous value
MISC	in addition  people have been shown to commit a time-saving bias by underestimating the time that can be saved when increasing from a low speed and overestimating the time that can be saved when increasing from a relatively high speed
MISC	these misestimations have been shown to relate to biases in judgments of the speed required to arrive at a specific time and to choosing unduly high speed
MISC	professional drivers  such as taxi drivers  might be less susceptible to these biases due to their increased driving experience
OWNX	in the current study  we interviewed taxi drivers about a journey they were currently making and examined their estimations of journey time  average speed and time savings
MISC	compared to a group of non-professional car drivers  taxi drivers showed the same considerable misestimations of driving speed  journey time and time savings as non-professionals
MISC	however  overestimations of time savings among taxi drivers were smaller than those made by car drivers
OWNX	we discuss the practical significance of these findings
MISC	estimating driving speed is not an easy task
MISC	research on mean speed estimation indicates that people make systematic errors in estimating average speed
MISC	for example  when judging the mean speed of a trip that included two parts  one with a higher speed and one with a lower speed  people overestimate the weight of the higher speed and underestimate the impact of the lower speed on the average speed of the entire trip  citation
MISC	for example  when drivers were asked to estimate the mean speed of a journey when it was possible to drive at a high speed e g    number  kph for most of the trip except for a limited part of the trip  where speed limit was significantly lower e g    number  kph  the mean speed of the entire route was overestimated  citation
MISC	in contrast to previous theoretical assertions that people assign equal weights to different speeds when estimating the mean speed of a trip  citation   these studies found that people actually assign different weights to different speeds  usually overweighting higher speeds and underweighting lower speeds  citation
MISC	recent research has emphasized emotion's role in non-utilitarian judgments  but has not focused much on characteristics of subjects contributing to those judgments
MISC	the present article relates utilitarian judgment to individual disposition to experience various emotions
OWNX	diverse emotions were elicited during judgment  guilt  sadness  disgust  empathy  anger  and anxiety  etc
MISC	on the other hand  disgust and empathy correlated negatively
MISC	these results suggest that people's emotional dispositions can affect their judgment
MISC	 no matter what happens in the courtroom  it all comes down to emotion of jury
MISC	  - boston legal  citation in the trolley dilemma  a runaway trolley is headed for five people who will be killed unless steps are taken to stop it
MISC	the only way to save them is to hit a switch that will turn the trolley onto an alternate track where it will kill one person instead of five
MISC	should you turn the trolley in order to save five people at the expense of one
MISC	according to greene  sommerville  nystrom  darley   and  cohen  citation   most people said yes
MISC	now consider another problem  the footbridge dilemma
MISC	as before  a trolley threatens to kill five people
MISC	you are standing next to a large stranger on a footbridge that spans the tracks  in between the oncoming trolley and the five people
MISC	in this scenario  the only way to save the five people is to push this stranger off the bridge with your own hands  onto the tracks below
MISC	he will die if you do this  however his body will stop the trolley from reaching the others
MISC	should you save the five others by pushing this stranger to his death
MISC	most people say no  citation
MISC	the question is  why not
MISC	 utilitarianism is defined as the idea that the morally correct course of action is the one that produces the greatest total benefit for all people affected  citation
MISC	from a psychological point of view  utilitarian judgments are defined as endorsing harmful actions that promote the greater good  citation  and judgments favoring the aggregate welfare over the welfare of fewer individuals  citation
MISC	there are differences between the trolley dilemma and the footbridge dilemma  greene et al citation  labeled them as an impersonal moral dilemma and a personal moral dilemma  respectively
MISC	according to greene  and  haidt  citation   personal moral violations meet the following criteria  the violation must be likely to cause serious bodily harm  this harm must befall a particular person or set of people  and the harm must not result from the deflection of an existing threat onto a different party
MISC	in short  personal moral violation is  me hurt you   citation   that is i  as an agent  hurt you  a visible person in front of me
MISC	if it fails to meet these criteria  the moral violation is impersonal
MISC	in addition  it had been shown that moral judgment could be induced by hypnotic disgust  citation
MISC	in a subsequent study  citation   emotion's role on utilitarian judgment had been supported by inducing positive affect  which resulted in increasing utilitarian judgments
MISC	nonetheless  there are a few empirical studies about people's individual disposition related to emotion as to utilitarian judgments
MISC	it was suggested that judgments would vary from individual to individual  citation
MISC	if tasks and mood induction affect people's utilitarian judgment  we might think that people's emotional disposition also affects moral judgment
OWNX	we present the maximization inventory  which consists of three separate scales  decision difficulty  alternative search  and satisficing
OWNX	the satisficing scale is a new addition to the study of maximization behavior  and we demonstrate that this scale is positively correlated with positive adaptation  whereas the decision difficulty and alternative search scales are positively correlated with nonproductive decisional behavior
MISC	the maximization inventory was then compared to previous maximization scales and  while the decision difficulty and alternative search scales are positively correlated with similar previous constructs  the satisficing scale offers a dimension entirely different from maximization
MISC	one of the most interesting variables in decision making research is the tendency toward  maximizing  versus  satisficing
MISC	  based originally on simon's  citation  theory of bounded rationality  schwartz  citation  suggested that there may be individual differences in the degree to which an individual is a  maximizer   who attempts to find the absolute best solution  versus a  satisficer   who is comfortable with a satisfactory  or  good enough   solution
MISC	schwartz argued that not only could such tendencies influence the outcomes of the decision but also that maximizing could reduce psychological well-being
MISC	for example  maximizers may worry that an unforeseen option will turn out to be the best one  and as a consequence  they will try to collect as much information as possible when making even the simplest of decisions
MISC	to examine the relationship between maximizing tendencies and well-being and mental health  measures of maximization behavior were developed
MISC	the first and most widely used measure was the  number -item maximization scale developed by schwartz et al citation
MISC	nenkov  morrin  ward  schwartz  and hulland  citation  subsequently examined the factor structure of the maximization scale and found three factors  which they labeled  alternative search    decision difficulty  and  high standards   citation
MISC	the  alternative search  category consisted of six items measuring the tendency to expend resources in exploring all possible opportunities e g    when i watch tv  i channel surf  often scanning through the available options even while attempting to watch one program
MISC	the  decision difficulty  category consisted of four items representing the degree of difficulty experienced when making choices among abundant options e g    i often find it difficult to shop for a gift for a friend
MISC	the  high standards  category consisted of three items reflecting decision makers' tendency to hold high standards for themselves and things in general e g    no matter what i do  i have the highest standards for myself
MISC	by contrast  diab  gillespie  and highhouse  citation  argued that the multidimensional nature of the maximization scale is contradictory to the definition of maximization tendency
MISC	defining the maximization tendency as  a general tendency to pursue the identification of the optimal alternative   citation   diab et al developed the maximization tendency scale
MISC	the maximization tendency scale was constructed using the three high standards items from the maximization scale and adding six new items mainly focusing on the goal of maximizers to optimize the outcomes of decisions
MISC	in all of this scale development  satisficing-the theoretical opposite of maximizing-has never been directly measured and is only rarely mentioned in the literature
MISC	schwartz et al citation  reported the results of several studies  all of which supported the hypothesized adverse relationships of maximization to psychological well-being
MISC	in their study  number   maximization was negatively correlated with happiness  optimism  self esteem  and life satisfaction and positively correlated with depression  regret  and perfectionism
MISC	four additional studies showed that maximization scale total scores were positively correlated with depression and negatively correlated with subjective happiness
MISC	schwartz et al explained that maximizers tend to engage in extensive alternative search to increase the possibility of finding the best option  but this extensive search process may induce more anticipated regret and decrease pleasure once a choice has been made
MISC	in related studies  nenkov et al citation  used  number -item measures of each of the three factors
MISC	they found that scores on the high standards category were positively correlated with optimism  negatively correlated with depression  and uncorrelated with subjective happiness
MISC	decision difficulty showed the opposite pattern  being negatively correlated with subjective happiness and optimism and positively correlated with depression
MISC	lai  citation  concluded that the decision difficulty category is the key factor leading to negative correlations with well-being outcomes  which supports the findings of nenkov et al citation
MISC	by contrast  diab et al citation  found evidence suggesting that the high standards category was responsible for this relationship  because smaller correlations were found when maladaptive personality traits were compared to the maximization tendency scale rather than the maximization scale
MISC	thus  previous studies have suggested that maximization measures consist of several components  and that the relationships with well-being indices were heavily influenced by the method of measurement
MISC	to clarify the nature of the maximization construct and the degree to which its elements were related to measures of psychological well-being  the maximization scale and the maximization tendency scale were examined in four studies conducted by rim  turner  betz  and nygren  citation
MISC	rim et al concluded that the maximization scale measures three separate factors as postulated by its authors  but only the alternative search and decisional difficulty factors are both positively correlated with each other and negatively correlated with indices of well-being
MISC	high standards correlated strongly with the maximization tendency scale consisting of mainly high standards items and was strongly correlated with positive indices of well-being e g   optimism and happiness and functioning e g   self-esteem and self-efficacy
MISC	the high standards subscale and maximization tendency scale were positively correlated with the analytical decision making style  while the alternative search and decision difficulty subscales were positively correlated with the regret-based decision making style and with procrastination
MISC	the item-response theory analysis in rim et al citation  indicated serious weaknesses in the psychometric properties of the items of the existing scales
MISC	in addition  their experimental study confirmed that alternative search and decision difficulty were positively correlated with the maximization behavior while high standards and the maximization tendency scale were not
MISC	first  although  high standards  is a useful construct  it does not seem to fit with the concept of maximization as postulated by schwartz and colleagues
MISC	conceptually  the  alternative search  dimension seems closest to the construct of maximizing originally postulated by schwartz  citation
MISC	however  the similarity in the pattern of correlations between the decision difficulty scale  the alternative search scale  and the criterion variables suggests similar consequences if not similar meanings
OWNX	thus  we propose that items focusing on the behavioral aspects e g   alternative search and the emotional features e g   perceived decisional difficulty should be included in the nomological network  but items not closely aligned with these aspects should be discarded e g   high standards
MISC	all previous classical test theory analyses and the item-response theory analyses conducted by rim et al citation  suggest poor psychometric properties
MISC	for the former analyses  most subscale alphas were below  number   number   the minimum usually considered acceptable in research
MISC	although this may be attributed to the length of the scales  the item-response theory analyses suggest that the items themselves are not very discriminating
MISC	also  the content of some of the items may undermine the content validity of the scale
MISC	for example  the maximization scale describes some maximization behaviors in specific situations that may not be universal to all respondents e g    renting videos is really difficult
MISC	items that are too specific might confound the degree of maximization with the inexperience of the participant with the event
MISC	new items which reflect more general maximization tendencies e g   buying a car is more specific than buying groceries  may prove useful
OWNX	finally  all of the alternative search and decision difficulty items on the maximization scale are stated in the same direction i e   more searching and greater perceived decision difficulty  respectively  which means that satisficing is measured only indirectly  as the presumed lower end of the maximization dimension
MISC	direct examination of the satisficing construct would contribute to the understanding of the maximization behavior
MISC	based on this previous research on the nature  measurement  and correlates of the maximization behavior  the present series of studies was designed to develop and evaluate new measures of the decision difficulty and alternative search dimensions
OWNX	in study  number   we use classical test theory  factor analyses  and item-response theory to determine the best items for each of the three scales from a larger item pool
OWNX	after selecting the best items for each scale  we report values of coefficient alpha for each scale  the resulting factor structure  and the estimated parameter values from an item-response theory analysis
MISC	the content of the new scales can be validated through their relationship to the criterion measures as demonstrated in rim et al citation
MISC	study  number  examined the relationships of the new scales to the two major maximization scales studied to date-the maximization scale and maximization tendency scale
MISC	the endowment effect has been debated for over  number  years
MISC	recent research suggests that differential focus of attention might play a role in shaping preferences
OWNX	in two studies we investigated the role of biased attention in the emergence of endowment effects
OWNX	we thereby derive predictions from an extended version of evidence accumulation models by additionally assuming a bias in attentional allocation based on one's endowment status
OWNX	we test these predictions against an alternative account in which the endowment effect is the result of initial anchoring and adjustment differences  citation
OWNX	in study  number  we additionally use eye tracking and find that buyers focus more on value decreasing attributes than sellers and vice versa for value increasing attributes
MISC	in what is now considered classic work  fundamental biases in judgment and choice  and systematic deviations from rational behavior have been demonstrated  citation
MISC	in recent research the focus has shifted towards investigations of the underlying cognitive processes driving such effects  citation
MISC	the way information is attended to and used to construct preferences and values has increasingly become of primary interest  citation
MISC	one effect that has been studied in great detail across a variety of domains is the endowment effect  which violates one of the cornerstones of economic theory
MISC	the basic assumption of the coase theorem  citation  is that a persons' willingness-to-pay wtp and willingness-to-accept wta for a good should be nearly equivalent under the assumption of zero transaction costs
MISC	nevertheless  it has repeatedly been shown that wta for a good is considerably higher than wtp for the same good  leading to reduced trading
MISC	this effect appears to be related to aspects of losing an endowment and has thus been coined the endowment effect  citation
MISC	the endowment effect is a robust  although culturally influenced  citation   phenomenon  citation  that has been observed using various methodological approaches including non-incentivized price estimations  citation  and also incentive-compatible preference elicitation mechanisms  citation
MISC	it has been found to occur with both tangible goods such as mugs and pens  citation  and goods with uncertain values such as lottery tickets  citation
MISC	although there is no dearth of research on the endowment effect  more work is needed to understand the underlying processes  which are still under heavy debate  citation
MISC	several theories have been put forward to provide an explanation for the endowment effect  citation
MISC	the classic explanation is based on prospect theory  citation  and assumes that loss aversion leads to an increased valuation of the good in the selling perspective as compared to the buying perspective   because removing a good from the endowment creates a loss while adding the same good to an endowment without it generates a gain   citation
MISC	research has expanded the loss-aversion explanation  citation  indicating that mechanisms such as differences in attentional focus  citation   the level of personal attachment  citation   and self-association with the good in question  citation  can also explain parts of the effect  citation
MISC	cognitive mechanisms have often been suggested as alternative or supplementary explanations to the classic loss-aversion account
MISC	carmon and ariely  citation   for example  argue that the endowment effect is caused by a stronger focus on the forgone  which differs between buyers i e   money and sellers i e   the good
MISC	query theory qt  citation  suggests a different process behind the effect in transactional situations in which information has to be retrieved from memory
MISC	individuals start with a memory query for aspects that support the status quo e g   for keeping the good vs the money which are weighted heavier than later queries and also act to inhibit subsequent queries for information which speaks against the status quo
MISC	in line with the qt account  nayakankuppam and mishra  citation  showed that   sellers appear to have a better representation of positive features and a worse representation of negative features  of the traded good   compared to buyers
MISC	  p  number   and that both groups spontaneously list more features in favor of their position  citation
MISC	based on the findings by nayakankuppam and mishra  citation   however  one might predict that for such description-based-decisions there should be a similar imbalance in attention as well
OWNX	in the following  we will refer to the application of concepts from qt to such tasks as description-based query theory dbqt
MISC	one class of process models that can explain the emergence of endowment effects in both kinds of tasks i e   decisions-from-descriptions and from memory are evidence accumulation approaches
MISC	in particular the sequential value matching model  citation -which is an extension of decision field theory  citation -has been developed to model the process of constructing monetary valuations for objects that can be understood as gambles e g   lottery tickets  and  risky prospects
MISC	conceptually  the svm model assumes that persons compare the gamble against a set of possible prices in a dynamic stochastic process
MISC	first  persons pick one possible price  which can be anywhere between the maximum and the minimum outcome of the gamble
MISC	if the gamble is worth less  the price is decreased by a small amount
MISC	this updating process is repeated until indifference is reached
OWNX	the starting point of the search process differs for different price elicitation methods and context conditions
MISC	over time both prices are adjusted towards a price in the middle of the price range
MISC	the svm model has been shown to explain several specific phenomena related to the disparity between wta and wtp
MISC	most notably  it can account for observed preference reversals  citation   which the classic loss aversion explanation cannot accommodate  citation
MISC	furthermore  the svm model has been shown to be able to qualitatively and quantitatively predict choices observed in previous studies as well as decision times and process tracing data  citation
MISC	this suggests that in place or on top of the mechanisms suggested by the svm model there are likely shifts in attention to the positive value increasing vs negative value decreasing aspects of an option based on one's perspective leading to overweighting of these aspects and resulting in pricing differences as found in the endowment effect
OWNX	adding this assumption of a biased shift in attention based on one's perspective we formulate a set of related hypotheses  the biased evidence accumulation bea hypotheses
MISC	this should be the case at least in the early stage of the decision process  while prices are still being adjusted and price search has not yet been completed
MISC	due to a bias in accumulating evidence the disparity between wta and wtp will increase with increases in deliberation time
MISC	if  in contrast  endowment effects are driven solely by differential anchoring and adjustment  as suggested by svm  citation   increased deliberation time should instead lead to decreases in the size of endowment effects  as pricing adjustments presumably will on average go down for sellers and up for buyers
OWNX	this hypothesis provides us with our alternative prediction in study  number 
OWNX	using eye-tracking methodologies in study  number  we test directly whether attentional focus is influenced by perspective and whether this affects valuations as our second and third bea-hypotheses
MISC	sampling of evidence biased towards either the value increasing decreasing attribute will lead to corresponding increases decreases in valuations
MISC	sampling of outcomes will be in part dependent on the stated probability of those outcomes occurring
OWNX	furthermore  although qt is a memory based account we abstract it to dbqt and apply two of its underlying information processing concepts i e   query direction switches as deliberations continue  and early queries have a greater impact than later queries to online information queries via attention  which we test as two further bea-hypotheses in study  number 
MISC	buyers will begin to accumulate more value decreasing and sellers more value increasing evidence  but there will be an increased focus on the opposite kind of information over time
MISC	h number  early weighting hypothesis
MISC	earlier accumulated evidence will have a greater impact on subsequent valuations than will later evidence
OWNX	in the following we present and discuss results from two studies
OWNX	in study  number  we find that the wta wtp disparity grows with increasing deliberation time  as predicted by our first specific bea-hypothesis  but counter to the prediction of the svm model
MISC	previous research on the role of choice set size in decision making has focused on decision outcomes and satisfaction
MISC	in contrast  little is known about interindividual differences in preferences for larger versus smaller choice sets  let alone the causes of such differences
MISC	drawing on self-efficacy theory  two studies examined the role of decision-making self-efficacy in preferences for choice
MISC	using a correlational approach  study  number  n    number  found that decision-making self-efficacy was positively associated with preferences for choice across a range of consumer decisions
MISC	preferences for choice and pre-choice information seeking were significantly lower in a low-efficacy condition compared to a high-efficacy condition and a control group
MISC	from the supermarket to the hospital  consumers are faced with more choice than ever before  citation
MISC	previous research on this phenomenon has focused almost exclusively on the consequences of having more versus less choice  citation
MISC	in contrast  very few studies have investigated preferences for choice  that is  how much choice people actually want
MISC	the limited research in this area suggests that  while larger choice sets are generally more enticing  citation   there are significant inter- and intra-individual differences
MISC	empirically  preferences for choice were found to vary across decision domains  age groups  and even nationalities  citation
MISC	although the underlying mechanisms that drive preferences for choice have not been systematically explored  converging evidence points to a key role of decision-making self-efficacy dmse
MISC	self-efficacy  which refers to the belief in one's ability to succeed in a given task  citation   drives individuals to prefer more challenging tasks and persist more in the face of such challenges  citation
MISC	two streams of recent empirical work suggest that dmse  which entails confidence in the ability to make effective decisions  may affect preferences for choice
MISC	first  individuals with higher versus lower dmse prefer decisions that are more challenging and complex  citation   and seek more information when making decisions  citation
MISC	the latter effect has been demonstrated across multiple domains ranging from consumer choices  citation  to career selection  citation  and health-related decisions  citation
MISC	since dmse engenders preferences for complex decisions and increased information  and information and complexity are part and parcel of increased choice  it is plausible that dmse would also be associated with preferences for larger choice sets
MISC	for example  individuals are more likely to prefer larger versus smaller choice sets when there are fewer versus more attributes to consider  or when dominating alternatives are present versus absent  citation
MISC	one study involving hypothetical decisions among consumer products demonstrated that individuals prefer larger assortments when they assume that the options within the assortments will be ordered based on their preferences i e   from most to least preferred versus not  citation
MISC	in a similar vein  individuals prefer increased choice when their choice-relevant preferences are highly accessible  citation
MISC	in combination  these findings suggest that individuals prefer more choice when they expect to be able to make effective decisions
OWNX	although previous research is consistent with predictions derived from self-efficacy theory  the association between dmse and preferences for choices has-to the best of our knowledge-not been systematically examined
MISC	study  number  examined correlations between self-report measures of dmse and preferences for choice across multiple consumer domains
MISC	study  number  assessed the effect of experimental manipulations of dmse on preferences for choice and information-seeking in a complex decision scenario with realistic outcomes
OWNX	we analyze behavior in two basic classes of decision tasks  description-based and experience-based
OWNX	in particular  we compare the prediction power of a number of decision learning models in both kinds of tasks
OWNX	we document that the pt and the evl models are best for predicting people's decisions in description- and experience-based tasks  respectively  which is not surprising as these two models are designed specially for these kinds of tasks
OWNX	furthermore  we find that models involving linear weighting of gains and losses perform better in both kinds of tasks  from the point of view of generalizability and individual parameter consistency
OWNX	finally  for some of the models' parameters  we document consistency at the individual level between description- and experience-based tasks
OWNX	all our lives we have to make decisions
OWNX	we have to choose where to go on vacation  when to replace our old car  which pair of shoes to buy
OWNX	in fact  each step we make in our life is a result of a decision we have made
MISC	even if we do nothing  this is probably our personal choice
MISC	therefore  understanding and systematically describing people's behavior is extremely important both for predicting their future decisions and for potentially improving decision quality
OWNX	decisions we make may be classified into two main categories
MISC	respectively  decisions based on past personal experience are called experience-based decisions
MISC	tasks typically studied under the description-based paradigm tend to focus on one-shot decisions that are based on detailed information concerning the relevant outcome distributions
MISC	tasks typically studied under the experience-based paradigm do not provide objective prior information concerning the payoff distributions  and this could be these tasks' drawback
MISC	on the other hand  the decisions are repeated  and thus decision-makers get a chance to learn from experience
MISC	the distinction between risky description-based and experience-based decisions has attracted recent attention because the ostensibly same information can lead to different choices depending on how the information is acquired citation
MISC	this difference  sometimes referred to as description-experience gap  is usually attributed to the difference in treatment of rare outcomes in the two paradigms
MISC	on the one hand  in description-based tasks  according to  presentation effect   low-probability events are likely to be overweighted if their probabilities are explicitly presented citation
MISC	on the other hand  in experience-based tasks  low-probability outcomes may be underweighted either because of a recency effect-since low-probability events are not likely to occur recently the availability of personal experience tends to reduce the weighting of these events citation -or simply because of a small sample size  which may cause rare events not to occur at all during relatively short intervals of time citation
MISC	as an example of a description-experience gap  we may cite a classic example given by weber citation   consider the decision of whether to vaccinate a child against diphtheria  tetanus  and pertussis dtp
MISC	an increasing number of parents  after reading such information  decide not to immunize their child
MISC	although doctors have the same statistics at their disposal  they also have access to information not available to parents-namely  personal experience gathered across many patients
MISC	few doctors will have encountered one of the rare cases of high fever or seizures
MISC	if they have encountered one  the experience is dwarfed by hundreds of memories of side-effect free immunizations
MISC	one sources of differences between doctors and vaccine resisters may result from differences in the weight given to rare events like the likelihood of a seizure as a function of whether this likelihood is acquired through experience or statistical description
OWNX	our major goal is to determine which models best explain behavior in these two classes of decision tasks
OWNX	we carry out an experiment involving a battery of description-based and experience-based choices
AIMX	to examine the common behavioral characteristics of these kinds of tasks  we employ a number of formal decision learning models  incorporating a number of factors or parameters  namely  loss aversion  diminishing sensitivity  probability weighting  choice consistency or the degree of randomness in choice  and recency the tendency to relate past information to the current choice
OWNX	first  we use two well-established models  i prospect theory pt citation   which was developed mainly for description-based tasks  and ii expectancy-valence model evl citation   which was designed specially for experience-based tasks
OWNX	in description-based tasks  in order to account for the presentation effect  a learning model should contain a possibility of non-linear weighting of explicitly stated probabilities
OWNX	therefore  we employ models possessing the probability weighting parameter  that is  pt and pt-no-s  for this kind of tasks
OWNX	our findings  based on the models' fit  support this expectation
OWNX	we thus expect that the better fitting models should also provide higher individual parameter consistency
OWNX	in other words  we hypothesize that an individual who  according to a certain model  reveals relatively high low values of certain decision parameters in a certain task should reveal  according to the same model  relatively high low values of the same parameters in other tasks of the same choice paradigm
MISC	the former surmise is partially supported  since in description-based tasks the combined pt-no-s model is found to outperform the pt model in terms of parameter consistency
MISC	this finding is in line with other results indicating that models involving linear weighting of gains and losses perform better in both kinds of tasks
OWNX	finally  we expect that individuals' behavior should also be consistent between different choice paradigms  that is  individual parameters having similar functionality in description- and experience-based tasks should be positively correlated
MISC	this hypothesis is only partially supported  suggesting that these widely-used learning models may still need further improvement
OWNX	in section  number   we present the models of decision-making we employ
OWNX	in section  number   we describe our experimental design and research approach
OWNX	section  number  describes the empirical tests we perform and provides the results
OWNX	section  number  concludes and provides a brief discussion
MISC	people not only seek to avoid losses or secure gains  they also attempt to create opportunities for obtaining positive outcomes
MISC	when distributing money between gambles with equal probabilities  people often invest in turning negative gambles into positive ones  even at a cost of reduced expected value
MISC	results of an experiment revealed that  number  the preference to turn a negative outcome into a positive outcome exists when people's ability to do so depends on their performance levels rather than merely on their choice   number  this preference is amplified when the likelihood to turn negative into positive is high rather than low  and  number  this preference is attenuated when people can lie about their performance levels  allowing them to turn negative into positive not by performing better but rather by lying about how well they performed
MISC	losses loom larger than gains  citation   and avoiding losses is more desired than securing gains  citation   especially when the motivation is in line with the individual's goals  citation
MISC	beyond avoiding losses and securing gains  however  people are motivated to create opportunities for securing positive outcomes  citation
MISC	people seek to increase the probability to win something  even at the cost of reduced expected value  citation
MISC	this tendency can translate into large monetary losses in real life  as people attempt to minimize the number of debts they have rather than focusing on reducing the total amount they owe  citation
MISC	specifically  among people holding multiple credit cards amar et al citation  found evidence for a debt account aversion  people consistently paid off small debts first  even though the larger debts had higher interest rates
MISC	people's psychological need to turn a negative-to-positive can be costly
MISC	payne and colleagues  citation  studied people's tendency to attempt increasing their probability of winning a positive outcome using mixed probability gambles
MISC	participants were asked to imagine that they  own a five-outcome gamble with the following payoffs and probabilities    number     number     number    number     number    number   -  number    number   -  number    number  now imagine that i tell you that you can change the gamble above in one of two ways
MISC	you can add   number  to the outcome that pays   number  or you can add the   number  to the outcome that pays   number 
MISC	   citation
MISC	although the expected value of the gamble remains constant regardless of the outcome participants chose to add money to as all outcome had the same probability to be chosen   number  percent  of participants preferred to add money to the outcome that increased their probability of winning a positive outcome e g     number   increasing the probability of winning a positive outcome from  number -out-of- number  to  number -out-of- number 
MISC	the remaining  number  percent  chose to add the money to the alternative outcome that did not increase their likelihood of winning something e g     number 
MISC	venkatraman  et al citation  further found that  number  percent  of the people who considered the following gamble   number    number     number    number     number    number     number    number   -  number    number   chose to add their   number  to the -  number  outcome rather than the   number  outcome  allowing them to turn the one negative outcome into a positive outcome  and thus increase their probability of winning something in the gamble from  number -out-of- number  to  number -out-of- number 
MISC	although people can influence their outcomes by choosing how to allocate funds  citation   they are often also able to influence their outcomes by choosing a task and working on it
MISC	for example  observing multiple tasks piling on their desks  such as emails to respond to and exams to grade  people must choose the task they will attend to first
MISC	they may choose the more urgent task of grading exams  or alternatively choose the task that is likely to take the least time to accomplish and reply to not so urgent emails
MISC	in such  people's desire to have less unattended tasks on their table  might lead them to procrastinate on the more urgent tasks they are facing
MISC	specifically  the current work asks whether people choose to invest their efforts in turning a negative outcomes into positive outcomes and thus increase their probability of winning a positive outcome
MISC	to address these questions  i adapted payne's  citation  paradigm and asked participants to add points to one of three outcomes  labeled  pot a    pot b  and  pot c   by choosing one of the pots
MISC	participants then predicted the outcomes of  number  coin tosses  gaining one point per correct prediction
MISC	points were added to the pre-selected pot only
OWNX	after participants completed the coin tossing task  one of the pots was randomly selected to determine the participant's final outcome
MISC	points translated to lottery tickets for an alleged lottery with two   x number ac  number  prizes
MISC	pot a had a positive initial outcome  number  points  pot c had a negative initial outcome - number  points  while pot b had a negative initial value that could potentially turn into a positive outcome  if participants predicted well enough on the coin tossing task
MISC	as people seek to maximize the probability of winning something  and thus turn negative outcomes into positive ones  they should be sensitive to the likelihood of turning the negative outcome into a positive one
MISC	when the likelihood of successfully turning the negative outcome into a positive outcome is low i e   when accomplishing the task is possible but relatively difficult due to the initial value of the pot  people should be less likely to choose modifying this outcome
MISC	in contrast  when the likelihood of successfully turning the negative outcome into a positive outcome is high i e   when accomplishing the task is possible and also relatively easy due to the initial value of the pot  people should be more likely to choose modifying this outcome
MISC	this begs the question of whether situations allowing people to dishonestly over-report their performance levels may lead people to pay less attention to the likelihood of being able to turn a negative-to-positive  citation
MISC	in other words  when people can lie to improve their outcomes  will the likelihood of turning a negative-to-positive i e   low vs high initial pot value no longer be relevant
MISC	the success of simple strategies depends both on bets about the structure of the environment and on the core capacities of the human mind  such as recognition memory  citation
MISC	however  the interplay between the environment and the mind's core capacities has rarely been precisely modeled
OWNX	we illustrate how these environment-mind interactions could be formally modeled within the cognitive architecture act-r  citation
MISC	act-r is an integrated theory of mind that is tuned to the statistical structure of the environment  and it can account for a variety of phenomena such as learning  problem solving  and decision making
MISC	the six million dollar man was among the most popular television shows in the  number 's  at least among eight to twelve year old american boys
MISC	the credits open with a spectacular crash of a rocket jet tumbling into a fireball
MISC	a team of surgeons hovers over steve austin  test pilot  working feverishly to replace his injured legs  right arm and eye with superbly engineered  bionic  substitutes
OWNX	in the voice over we hear   gentlemen  we can rebuild him
OWNX	we have the technology
OWNX	we have the capability to make the world's first bionic man
MISC	better than he was before
MISC	better  stronger  faster
OWNX	  we cut next to steve austin  six million dollar man  racing across a field and seeing objects at a distance with his better-than-a-telescope eye
MISC	similarly  we would be better off  or at least  would have had better college transcripts if we had been blessed with bionic cognitive abilities  such as unfailing memories and the ability to hold complex equations in mind
MISC	another view on the humble cognitive capacities of the human mind is that those limitations - such as forgetting - may serve important functions
MISC	in this view  the human memory system is organized in a way which facilitates the retrieval of information which is recent or frequent  citation  and sensitive to the context  citation
MISC	many word processors incorporate a timesaving feature that illustrates this view of forgetting
MISC	when a user goes to open a document file  the program presents a  file buffer   a list of recently opened files from which the user can select
MISC	for this device to work efficiently  however  the word processor must provide users with the files they actually want
MISC	it does so by  forgetting  files that are considered unlikely to be needed on the basis of the assumption that the time since a file was last opened is negatively correlated with its likelihood of being needed now
MISC	similarly  if you want to remember where you have parked your car  it is quite useful to forget where you have parked before
MISC	there is growing evidence also from other domains such as language acquisition that cognitive limits can be beneficial  citation  while too much thinking can even hurt performance  for example for sports experts  citation  and in implicit category learning decaro  thomas   and  beilock  in press
MISC	in line with this view of the mind as an adaptation to the environment  the program on fast and frugal heuristics takes the position that humans possess a repertoire of cognitive strategies  or heuristics  which can solve specific problems  citation
MISC	gigerenzer et al called this collection of cognitive strategies the adaptive toolbox
MISC	the rationality of these heuristics is not logical but ecological  success is anchored both in the structure of the environment and in the core capacities of the human mind  citation
MISC	a cognitive strategy can be simple by exploiting the core capacities such as recognition or recall memory of the human mind that through evolution or learning are highly automatized  requiring little or no effort
MISC	goldstein and gigerenzer  citation   consider heuristics to be adaptive strategies that evolved in tandem with fundamental psychological mechanisms  p  number 
MISC	within the fast and frugal program  this interplay between the environment and the mind has rarely been explored with detailed models of core capacities
MISC	the models of heuristics presupposed specific core capacities of the mind such as recognition memory without embedding the core capacity directly into the model
MISC	in other words  models of heuristics and many other models of decision making are underspecified with regard to how decision making will be affected by the interaction between the mind's core capacities and the structure of the environment
OWNX	in particular  we employ a formal cognitive architecture such as act-r  citation  to explore this issue
MISC	in principle  other cognitive models of memory could be used for the purpose of analyzing the relation between environment  memory  and the performance of inference strategies
OWNX	in fact  we believe the main findings regarding memory function and the ecological rationality of inference strategies would remain largely the same as long as a reasonable model of memory was used
MISC	one such model  rem  citation   descends from sam  citation   but is enriched by a bayesian analysis in the spirit of j r anderson's rational analysis  citation
MISC	another good candidate would be minerva-dm  citation   which has been shown to account for a wide variety of judgment phenomena  including for example  the availability and the representativeness heuristics
OWNX	the relation between act-r and other models will be discussed in more detail in the general discussion  where we will also illustrate how act-r could be extended to topics and tasks beyond those examined here
MISC	the results replicated important findings reported by weber et al citation  in the chinese culture
OWNX	results of both exploratory factor analysis efa and confirmatory factor analysis cfa showed that the ethical  recreational  health safety  and gambling domains were preserved in the chinese version of dospert and that the items from social and investment domains formed one factor
MISC	significant past research has been conducted to understand people's differences in their risk-taking behaviors  which are often referred as differences in risk attitude
MISC	according to the expected utility theory  citation  and prospect theory  citation   risk attitude is explained by the shape of a utility function
MISC	in this model  risk attitude-an individual's location on the continuum from risk aversion to risk seeking-is assumed to be a personality trait  citation
MISC	based on this single trait view of risk attitude  researchers have employed various methods to measure it
MISC	some studies require participants to choose between lotteries and then compare participants' observed choices to choices predicted by the expected value  citation
MISC	using the probability equivalence method  kogan and wallach  citation  developed the choice dilemma questionnaire  asking respondents for probability equivalents in twelve choice dilemmas  which are combined into a single score that represents risk attitude
MISC	nonetheless  according to blais and weber  citation   these studies were questionable due to two major problems
MISC	firstly  people may be classified as risk seeking or risk averse depending on the method employed to measure risk attitude  citation
MISC	secondly  even the same method may categorize an individual into different groups across different situations and domains  citation
MISC	these problems suggest that those measurements do not possess a satisfactory predictive validity across a range of situations  citation
MISC	given this obvious deficiency of many risk attitude measurements  recently some researchers have claimed that risk attitude should be conceptualized in the risk-return framework of risky choice and treated in a domain-specific manner  citation
MISC	risk-return models assume risk taking to reflect a tradeoff between perceived risk fear and expected return hope  citation   risk taking preference x   a expected benefit x   b perceived risk x   c where a represents the marginal effect of expected benefit of x on the risk taking preference  b represents the marginal effect of perceived risk of x on the risk taking preference  and c is the error term
MISC	researchers have found systematic situational and group differences in perceived risk and expected benefit of risky behaviors  citation
MISC	nevertheless  people's perceived-risk attitude coefficient b-remains relatively stable across situations and groups  citation
MISC	therefore  differences in perceived risk and expected return of risky choices seem to play a major part in the observed domain-specificity of risk attitude  citation
MISC	in this risk return framework  weber et al citation  developed the domain-specific risk-taking dospert scale in order to assess both conventional risk attitudes apparent risk taking  i e   risk taking preference in the formula above and perceived-risk attitudes in six domains  namely  social  recreational  gambling  investment  health safety  and ethical decisions
MISC	the conventional risk attitudes is defined as people's stated level of risk taking  and perceived-risk attitude is defined as the willingness to engage in a risky behavior as a function of its perceived risk  citation
MISC	therefore  the dospert scale measures both individuals' propensity to engage in risk activities and their perceived risk and expected return of these activities  making it possible to study the relationship between apparent risk taking and risk perception and thus perceived-risk attitude
MISC	using this scale  weber et al citation  demonstrated that participants' degree of risk taking differed across domains and these differences were primarily associated with differences in perceived risk and expected return of risky behaviors rather than differences in perceived-risk attitude
MISC	researchers have provided strong evidence for the dospert scale's reliability and validity  citation
MISC	weber et al citation  reported its initial psychometric properties  including moderate reliability estimates  satisfactory construct validity and convergent discriminant validity with respect to constructs such as sensation seeking  intolerance for ambiguity  and social desirability
MISC	geographically  the dospert has been validated in many other cultures such as german  dutch  italian  and spanish  citation
MISC	nonetheless  to date  the scale has not been tested in eastern cultures
OWNX	for simplicity sake  we will refer to our translated and revised version of the scale as dospert-c
OWNX	in study  number   we attempted to identify the factor structure of the dospert-c using an exploratory factor-analytic procedure
OWNX	moreover  we examined the reliability of the dospert-c
MISC	as mentioned above  the risk-return framework assumes the involvement of various determinants  namely  perceived risk  expected benefit  and perceived-risk attitude
MISC	thus  this study's emphasis is on conventional risk attitudes  the perception of risk  and perceived-risk attitude
OWNX	in study  number   in order to provide further empirical support for the factor structure of the dospert-c  we conducted confimatory factor analysis
MISC	runs of gains and losses are particularly salient to decision makers because of their perceived departure from randomness  as well as their immediate impact on the financial status of the decision makers
MISC	past research has focused on decision making biases that relate to faulty conceptions of chance and luck  such as the gambler's fallacy and the hot hand effect
MISC	participants in the current study bet on the outcomes of a long sequence of simulated coin tosses
MISC	risk preferences were found to change as a function of run valence i e   losses vs gains  run length  and financial status
MISC	individuals were found to differ in the effect of all of these factors  in their responses to runs of gains and losses in sequential risky choice
MISC	financial analysts make repeated decisions involving gains and losses  and the charting of financial data is a common method used to summarize the past performance of companies and markets
MISC	runs of consecutive gains or losses are frequently depicted in these charts  and are generally some of their more noticeable characteristics
MISC	behavioral finance researchers believe these run patterns are so prominent that runs can affect future predictions made by analysts
MISC	this influence is troubling because runs  as highlighted in shefrin's quote  often occur naturally without any special underlying cause
MISC	shefrin  citation  emphasized the folly of basing financial predictions solely on run patterns  and he provided case studies of financial experts to illustrate these poor decisions
MISC	one example involved a prediction in  number  by a senior investment adviser for merrill lynch
MISC	after an exceptionally long period with high returns from equities  the analyst incorrectly forecast that below average returns were inevitable after such a long run of gains
MISC	unfortunately for the analyst  there was a  number   number  percent increase in the dow jones index by the close of trading that year
MISC	this analyst committed the classic gambler's fallacy  believing that long runs of outcomes have a low frequency of occurrence  and  therefore  runs are more likely to end the longer they continue
MISC	but runs of losses and gains are not like other binary events  because the consequences of these events can also have a financial impact on the decision maker
MISC	a run of losses will result in a depletion of financial resources  just as a run of gains will result in an increase in financial resources
MISC	but most real-world and laboratory-based studies of the impact of runs of gains and losses on risk preferences have focused solely on biased reasoning explanations and disregarded explanations based on the financial impacts of runs
MISC	for example  sundali and croson  citation  examined the prevalence of the gambler's fallacy and the hot hand with gamblers playing roulette in a casino
MISC	the hot hand is another decision bias that can result from betting on random events
MISC	decision makers who follow a hot hand heuristic behave as if runs of gains or losses are likely to continue  possibly because winning creates an illusion of control
MISC	as a result  these decision makers risk more after a run of gains and risk less after a run of losses
MISC	sundali and croson  citation  tested for the hot hand effect by looking at the number of bets gamblers made after a win or after a loss
MISC	the researchers assumed that a hot hand bias would cause gamblers to make more bets after a win than after a loss  and they found many gamblers who produced such betting behaviors
MISC	they suggested that gamblers could also place more bets after a win because they feel richer
MISC	however  sundali and croson  citation  had no way of recording the financial status of the gamblers in their study
MISC	for example  johnson  tellis  and macinnis  citation  examined the effects of runs of losses and gains on a single simulated investment decision
MISC	the investment decision was based on stock reports that highlighted a run of gains or losses immediately prior to this investment decision
OWNX	the length of the run was manipulated by the researchers
MISC	the majority of participants varied their choice on the basis of the prior runs  and the researchers explained these choices in terms of a hot hand or gambler's fallacy
MISC	although this research has important implications for one-off investment decisions  the experimental design fails to capture the dynamic nature of sequential risky choice
MISC	the prior run of gains or losses had no direct effect on the financial status of the participants  and subsequently  no effect on the choices made by participants
OWNX	not surprisingly  the reasons provided by the participants in this experiment appeared to indicate biased probabilistic reasoning
OWNX	in this study  participants were provided with a long sequence of binary gambles where the riskiness of the gambles was manipulated by changing the variance in the amount to be lost or gained
MISC	although this experimental manipulation does not change the actual risk of the gamble i e   expected value remains the same for each choice  previous research has shown that participants perceive gambles with larger variance as riskier choices
MISC	for example  winning or losing   number   number  is perceived as riskier than winning or losing   number   number 
MISC	leopard recorded the run valence loss vs gain and run length before each choice was made  and also recorded the current bank of the participant each time a gamble was played
MISC	she inferred that eight participants had followed the gambler's fallacy figure  number a and three participants had shown the hot hand effect figure  number b
MISC	she believed that these participants increased their risk  because they perceived long runs of any type to signal that a positive outcome is imminent
MISC	leopard's conclusions raise several questions
MISC	leopard admitted that  outcome and financial state are inherently confounded to some degree for at least some of the subjects  p  number 
MISC	many of the participants in figures  number a and  number b showed stronger non-linear trends as run length increased or as run valence changed
MISC	finally  the outcomes of each participant's gambles were random  and therefore the participant's financial state at the times when runs occurred could have varied dramatically within and between participants
MISC	it is not out of the question that a participant may have experienced runs only when down from their initial bank  or alternatively  experienced runs only when up from their initial bank
MISC	the difficulty with using random event sequences is that there is no control over when runs will occur  what type of run will occur  and how long each run will be
MISC	the goal of the current study is to improve on the leopard  citation  study by controlling the type of runs  the length of runs  and when these runs occur with respect to the participant's financial state
MISC	a more thorough statistical analysis of the data collected will also provide better justification for the speculated causes of risk preference patterns during runs of gains and losses
MISC	i hypothesize that financial status will affect risk preferences  but runs of gains and losses will still influence risk preferences independently of the effects of status
OWNX	consequently  linear patterns of risk preferences that follow the gambler's fallacy negative slope and the hot hand positive slope are still expected
MISC	however  other participants may show significant non-linear relationships between run variables and risk preference  and there are two possible explanations for these non-linear patterns
MISC	prior research has found that the perceptions of runs may not be linearly related to length
MISC	carlson and schu  citation  recently reported that an incremental reaction to a sequence of repeated outcomes often peaks at three consecutive outcomes and plateaus after this third event
MISC	a second explanation for non-linear effects is that the participant follows different strategies for runs of different lengths and or valence
MISC	for example  the self-perception of being a  lucky winner  after a couple of wins in a row will compete with the growing misperception that this streak must end if it continues to grow
MISC	eventually  the latter perception may win out  and a change in risk preference occurs  leading to a non-linear pattern of risk preferences
MISC	i hypothesize that the use of risk strategies during runs of gains and losses is much more dynamic and transient than suggested by previous research
OWNX	in three studies  we examined factors that may temporarily attenuate information search
MISC	people are generally curious and dislike uncertainty  which typically encourages them to look for relevant information
MISC	despite these strong forces that promote information search  people sometimes deliberately delay obtaining valuable information
MISC	interestingly  the decision to search or to postpone searching for information is influenced not only by the value and importance of the information itself but also by well-being maintenance goals related to possible detrimental effects that negative knowledge may have on unrelated future plans
MISC	yet ah
MISC	why should they know their fate
MISC	since sorrow never comes too late  and happiness too swiftly flies
MISC	thought would destroy their paradise
MISC	no more  where ignorance is bliss  'tis folly to be wise
OWNX	consistent with this notion  we provide here three empirical demonstrations of people thinking and behaving in accordance with the belief that sometimes  'tis folly to be wise
MISC	we hypothesized that  when potentially negative information could interfere with future pleasurable plans  people would temporarily avoid this information until after the event had ended
MISC	specifically  we suggest the choice to avoid potentially negative information is at least partly determined by well-being maintenance goals i e   enjoyment of future events
MISC	consider  for instance  the case of receiving an envelope from the tax authority while getting ready to catch the plane for a weekend out in las vegas
MISC	opening the envelope is wise  as knowing if the letter brings bad news can help one make well-informed financial decisions
MISC	indeed  because of the importance of making well-informed decisions people generally exhibit strong curiosity and search for information  citation
MISC	however  we think that people are less likely to open the envelope when it arrives just before they head to vegas  in order to avoid spoiling the trip
MISC	importantly  putting off information search-leaving the envelope closed at home-is not a guarantee for a peaceful weekend either  as the uncertainty and associated rumination can also ruin the trip
MISC	in such cases  individuals might thus prefer to resolve uncertainty before the trip
MISC	what then determines whether people would search or avoid information
MISC	thus individuals determine whether certainty or uncertainty is worse and hence search or avoid information
MISC	studying group decision-making is challenging for multiple reasons
MISC	an important logistic difficulty is studying a sufficiently large number of groups  each with multiple participants
MISC	assembling groups online could make this process easier and also provide access to group members more representative of real-world work groups than the sample of college students that typically comprise lab face-to-face ftf groups
OWNX	we did so in a study that manipulated gain loss framing of a risky decision between groups and examined the decisions of both individual group members and groups
MISC	all of these dependent measures are compared for an online and an ftf sample
OWNX	our results suggest that web-conferencing can be a substitute for ftf interaction in group decision-making research  as we found no moderation effects of communication medium on individual or group decision outcome variables
MISC	to wit  discussions among the online groups were shorter  but generated a greater number of thought units  i e   they made more efficient use of time
MISC	studying group decision making is more challenging than studying individual decision making for multiple reasons
MISC	it requires more complex data analysis methods due to an increase in the number of levels of analysis and relevant variables
MISC	it also requires increased sample sizes for sufficient statistical power to test hypotheses  as groups rather than individuals are the unit of analysis
MISC	groups consist of members that in themselves constitute sources of variance  and this is further complicated by variation in the social interactions of group members between groups
MISC	all this increases between-group variability  which increases the required sample size to detect the effects of experimental manipulations
MISC	another challenge is the practical requirement of needing group members present at the same time and location  where single no-shows can lead to cancelled experimental sessions
MISC	morally challenging decisions tend to be perceived as difficult by decision makers and often lead to post-decisional worry or regret
OWNX	to test potential causes of these consequences  we employed realistic  morally challenging scenarios with two conflicting choice options
OWNX	in addition to respondents' choices  we collected various ratings of choice options  decision-modes employed  as well as physiological arousal  assessed via skin conductance
MISC	not surprisingly  option ratings predicted choice  such that the more positively rated option was chosen
MISC	however  respondents' self-reported decision modes also independently predicted choice
MISC	in some cases this was related to increased arousal
MISC	one of the factions starts to shell the town you are in
MISC	do you let them in or turn them away
MISC	regardless of which option you pick  would you be able to move forward effortlessly  forgetting about your decision and its consequences  or would you ruminate over your decision  wondering what would have happened had you decided to take the other option
MISC	moral choices such as this can be expected to produce more post-decisional rumination than choices without a moral dimension because of the gravity of such decisions
MISC	such decisions seem to lack clear right or wrong options  and they force decision makers to choose what often seems to them to be the lesser of two evils
MISC	this research examines the relationship between positive and negative perceptions of pensions and motivation to engage in the decision process of choosing a private pension plan  as well as satisfaction from the chosen pension plan  among trained economists
MISC	a sample of  number  economists completed a self-report survey examining the decision process of different decision contexts in life  including pension decisions
MISC	overall  participants showed low motivation to engage in the process of choosing a private pension plan  compared to their motivation to engage in other decision tasks
MISC	however  economists invested more in the decision process and showed greater satisfaction from their decision regarding their pension plan when they had a more positive perception of pensions
MISC	this perception is represented by higher subjective likelihood of receiving pension allowances for a long period  and by a profitable view of the balance between current payments and expected incomes from pension saving
MISC	studies have demonstrated that people show low motivation to engage in the process of choosing a pension plan as expressed by their minor involvement in the process  citation
MISC	as a result  they tend to settle on a default choice  citation   show passivity and procrastination in decision-making  citation   and sometimes avoid making the decision  citation
MISC	lusardi  citation  has found that most people have given very little thought to retirement even when they are just a few years away from leaving the workforce
MISC	benartzi and thaler  citation  reviewed empirical works on lay people's heuristics and biases in their savings for retirement decisions
MISC	in addition  they rely on non-experts' advice spouses and friends and tend to be influenced by framing manipulations
MISC	nowadays  people are living longer than ever  and retirement is becoming more and more expensive as the cost of living especially medical care and prescription drugs continues to increase
MISC	planners are more likely to experience a satisfying retirement because they have greater financial resources to rely on after they stop working  citation
MISC	therefore  it is important to understand the lack of motivation to engage in the process of choosing a pension plan as well as to find ways to increase involvement and motivation
MISC	one of the reasons for lay people's low involvement might be that most people simply do not have the knowledge and the capacity to interpret the information presented to them by employers and governments regarding private pension plans
MISC	when given a default option such as knowing the pension plan most people choose  or suggested by the employees' committee  lay people may use it to make a quick decision and put the issue aside even when this pension plan may not be the best for them personally
MISC	when people are confronted with a large number of options  the more options they are given  the less likely they are to be engaged in the choice task  citation   especially when the alternatives are seen as relatively similar and they are not able to understand the variations among them
MISC	lack of relevant knowledge and understanding may be a major reason for peoples' low involvement in pension decision processes  citation
MISC	in spite of the above assumption  behavioral decision research suggests that even with the required knowledge people might not act according to rational models by systematically examining the different options and their relevant attributes  citation
MISC	experts  like lay people  are also prone to simplifying heuristics and biases  citation
MISC	moreover  when a choice task is complex  includes many objects  and when the objects are relatively similar in some of their attributes  the tendency to use intuitive simplifying strategies increases
MISC	specifically  perception and feelings towards pension as a concept may affect the decision maker's attitude toward the task
MISC	the affect as information hypothesis  citation  suggests that judgments are affected by the positive and negative feelings towards the decision target other people  places  objects  as well as words  memories  etc
MISC	negative emotions towards pension and retirement might be a result of unpleasant thoughts and negative images of the future raised at the time of pension decisions  such as financial dependence  ill health  death  aging  or disabilities  citation
MISC	such thoughts may be psychologically threatening and anxiety provoking  causing  retirement anxiety   citation   which may not be restricted to older adults
MISC	interestingly  hayslip et al have found that younger adults showed even greater anxiety about retirement than older adults
MISC	indeed  the results of neukam and hershey  citation  suggest that lay people who experience retirement anxiety are less likely to plan and save for the future
MISC	in addition  since people see their pension expenses in their pay slips every month  and the incomes are expected only in the distant future  they might perceive their contributions as greater than discounted future income streams
MISC	benartzi and thaler  citation  suggest that people may experience  myopic loss aversion  in their saving for retirement decisions by being hypersensitive to short-term losses
MISC	such negative perceptions may decrease people's motivation to invest in the decision  increasing heuristics and biases in the decision process
MISC	some people may believe that they would not enjoy their pension for many years  and therefore might perceive a pension as an expense with only little gain
MISC	optimistic people  with the same objective life expectancy  who believe that they will receive their pension payments for a longer period of time  are expected to have a more positive attitude towards their pension
MISC	their thoughts about their future as well as their pension fund evaluation are expected to be more positive  as living longer means receiving more money from pension plans
MISC	these positive views held by more optimistic people may enhance the motivation to engage in the decision process  which may produce better satisfaction from the chosen pension plan
MISC	in summary  positive and negative perceptions of pension as a concept are likely to guide emotional reactions toward the decision task at the time of the decision and therefore are expected to influence the motivation to invest in the decision process
OWNX	we suggest two main factors that may shape these subjective perceptions of pensions  first  optimistic and pessimistic subjective views of the likelihood to receive pension payments for at least  number  years
MISC	pension decisions may be fundamentally different for people who believe that saving today will allow them to secure their standard of living in the future  as opposed to people with pessimistic perceptions that have the same expected longevity
MISC	people who perceive the likelihood of enjoying their pension for many years as higher are expected to care more about not having adequate financial means in their old age  since the possibility to experience that need is more concrete and real for them
MISC	therefore  optimistic people are more likely to make efforts and show greater motivation to invest in their pension decision
MISC	second  perceptions of the balance between gains and losses in pension payments  this balance might represent a positive perception of pensions when people believe that future discounted benefits would be greater than the current and discounted future contributions  and a negative perception if the reverse
OWNX	we hypothesize that motivation to invest in pension decisions would be greater for people who have a positive view of pensions and retirement caused by one or both of the above factors
MISC	these people are expected to be more involved in the decision process  examining a larger number of alternatives before choosing a pension plan and searching for more information about the chosen plan
OWNX	we also find no evidence that near misses in roulette leads to gamblers extending the time spent gambling or to the placing of more bets
MISC	near-miss events occur in a wide variety of domains including gambling  sports  natural disasters  and industrial accidents
MISC	depending upon the domain there are differing definitions of a near miss
MISC	within the gaming literature  reid  citation  defines a near miss as  a special kind of failure to reach a goal  one that comes close to being successful p  number   which griffiths  citation  shortens to  failures that are close to being successful p  number   and harrigan  citation  interprets as a  failure that was close to a win p  number  
MISC	harrigan  citation  notes that some prefer the term  near win  as it is a more logical description of the gambling event under consideration but the term near miss prevails
MISC	central to the definitions of a near miss is the belief and associated feelings that one almost won but didn't  or almost lost but didn't
MISC	locke  citation  uses the term  aww schucks
OWNX	  to capture the feeling of almost winning to which we add  that was a close one
MISC	the importance of near-miss events is that they can affect decisions made subsequent to each event
MISC	for example  there is experimental evidence that near misses lead gamblers to play longer
MISC	early research by strickland and grote  citation  showed that subjects exposed to a high proportion of winning symbols on the first two wheels of a three wheel slot machine tended to gamble longer  but this result could not be replicated by reid  citation  under slightly different experimental conditions
MISC	however  subsequent studies have found experimental evidence that near misses in slot machine games lead to more games played  citation  and increased playing time  citation
MISC	although most research on the near miss effect has focused on slot machine gambling  some research has examined the near-miss effect in other casino games
MISC	dixon  citation  found that subjects playing a simulated roulette game rated losing outcomes as closer to winning both when they were close in location to the winning number and when they were numerically close to the winning number
MISC	another study by dixon et al citation  found that blackjack players rated  non-bust  losses as close to wins  with the effect decreasing as the difference in the card values between the player and dealer increased
MISC	while both of these studies found a near miss effect in non-slot machine games  a limitation of these studies was that they were not designed to study how near misses affect subsequent gambling behavior
MISC	near misses also affect decision making away from the casino floor
MISC	in a project management domain  dillon and tinsley  citation  provide evidence that near-misses are often viewed as successes  which lead managers to make subsequent riskier decisions
MISC	further  the evidence suggests that managers who experience near-miss events  but do not experience a failure  will then subjectively assess the probability of a future failure as lower than the objective probability of failure  leading these managers to choose riskier alternatives
MISC	in the domain of natural disasters  dillon  tinsley and cronin  citation  provide evidence that if a house avoided flood damage in a hurricane a near-miss then subjects were less likely to buy flood insurance
MISC	subjects were also less likely to evacuate a house that had survived past hurricanes without damage
MISC	explaining this result  dillon  tinsley and cronin  citation  write  people did not update given probabilities  they did not calculate new probabilities  they simply felt differently about the initial probabilities that were given
MISC	thus it might be said that near-miss information changes people's frames of reference p  number 
MISC	sacred or protected values have important influences on decision making  particularly in the context of intergroup disputes
OWNX	we discuss implications of these findings for understanding intergroup conflicts  and suggest avenues for future research into the emergence and spread of sacred values
MISC	neuroimaging studies and behavioral research suggest that people process sacred values in terms of associated deontological rules rather than their utilitarian value  citation
MISC	specifically  when people transform preferences into sacred values they appear to use rules that govern reasoning about religious values  regarding as taboo any attempt to treat sacred values as fungible with secular goods
MISC	ironically  the more money or material things one offers to encourage people to make concessions over their sacred values  the more resistant people seem to be to compromise
MISC	thus  standard negotiation techniques of offering people added material incentives or threatening disincentives to encourage compromise backfire when sacred values are involved  citation
MISC	given the influence of sacred values on decision making  it seems important to understand how values acquire sacredness and to explain why some people are more likely than others to think of their preferences as sacred values
MISC	while many sacred values have deep historical roots  others can aquire sacredness quite quickly  citation
MISC	famously  ghandi tranformed salt into a sacred value as part of his opposition to british colonial rule  citation
OWNX	we report a preliminary study that compared decisions made in an oxygen depleted environment with those made in a normoxic environment
MISC	participants were presented with a series of choices that involved either losses or gains
MISC	for each choice they were forced to choose between a sure thing and a gamble of the same expected value
MISC	for choices involving losses  participants were more risk seeking in the oxygen depleted environment  for those involving gains  no difference was found
MISC	low aerial oxygen concentration is first detected by sensory receptors in the carotid body and then relayed to the hypothalamus  citation
MISC	the body responds to the decrease in the oxygen arterial saturation by increasing heart rate  blood pressure  ventilation  and the production of stress hormones  citation
MISC	such alterations are driven by the sympathetic nervous system and could reach awareness if oxygen depletion is sufficiently high
MISC	however  mild oxygen depletion is not easily detected by higher-order brain structures  citation
MISC	research has investigated the effects of hypoxia on human cognitive functions  citation
MISC	most studies focused on basic functions  such as visual perception  memory  attention  and language  citation
MISC	the data show that a  number  percent  reduction in the arterial blood oxygen saturation diminishes individuals' concentration capacity and muscular coordination  which impairs language production and visual perception  citation
MISC	a  number  percent  reduction in the arterial blood oxygen saturation diminishes memory performance and induces emotional lability and major motor impairments
OWNX	we believe that such research is worth pursuing for two reasons
MISC	first  people frequently experience mild levels of hypoxia  such as during prolonged physical exercise  underwater diving  high altitude recreational activities e g   mountaineering  paragliding  parachuting or a flight when a defect occurs to the cabin pressurization system
MISC	although there is no direct research on the impact of hypoxia on judgment and decision making  there is research concerning the impact of its effect stress
MISC	current views on cognitive system architecture nested within dual-process approaches  citation  suggest that stressful conditions affect decision-making by broadening the prevalence of intuitive  automatic processes over analytic  deliberative ones
MISC	in stressful situations individuals might rely on simple rules of thumb or heuristics  rather than on analytic processes that aim to maximize subjective utility
MISC	although heuristics in certain contexts are efficient guides for routine but complex tasks  citation   in others they can lead to systematic biases
MISC	for example  recent research  citation  has shown that acute stress induced by keeping ones hand in freezing water modulates gamble decisions  partially exacerbating a bias known as the reflection effect  people's tendency to avoid risk to secure a certain gain and to seek risk to avoid a certain loss  citation
OWNX	with the present research we investigated whether oxygen depletion also leads to an exacerbation of the reflection effect
MISC	in contrast to previous studies where participants were aware of the stressor used e g   time pressure  cold water  social pressure  participants in the present study were not aware of the mild oxygen depletion
MISC	hammond  citation  argued that much of the research in the field of judgment and decision making jdm can be categorized as focused on either coherence or correspondence c and c and that  in order to understand the findings of the field  one needs to understand the differences between these two criteria
MISC	first  i provide an overview of the terms coherence and correspondence c and c as philosophical theories of truth and relate them to the field of jdm
OWNX	second  i provide an example of hammond's claim by examining literature on base rate neglect
MISC	specifically  the c and c distinction  number  is more accurately applied to criteria than to researchers   number  should be refined to include two important types of coherence inter and intrapersonal coherence and  number  neglects the third philosophical theory of truth  pragmatism
MISC	pragmatism  as a class of criteria in jdm  is defined as goal attainment
MISC	in order to provide the most complete assessment of human judgment possible  and understand different findings in the field of jdm  all three criteria should be considered
MISC	hammond  citation  argued that there are two main camps of researchers in the field of judgment and decision making jdm who have each adopted different criteria for assessing the competence of human judgments and decisions
MISC	according to hammond  citation  researchers in the brunswikian tradition tend to emphasize the correspondence of judgment with ecological criteria  citation  while researchers in the heuristics and biases h and b program tend to assess coherence  citation
OWNX	second  i provide an example of hammond's claim by examining some of the literature on base rate neglect
MISC	specifically  i point out there are two important types of coherence and that a third philosophical theory of truth  pragmatism  is needed to complete the framework
OWNX	popular culture reflects whatever piques our imagination
MISC	think of the myriad movies and books that take viewers and readers on an imaginary journey to the past or the future e g   gladiator  the time machine
MISC	what determines whether a person would prefer to visit the certain past or explore the uncertain future
OWNX	we identified three factors that markedly affect people's preference for hypothetical travel to the past or the future  respectively
MISC	those who think of themselves as courageous  those with a more conservative worldview  and-perhaps counterintuitively-those who are advanced in age prefer to travel into the future
OWNX	we discuss implications of these initial results
MISC	two environments with such a conflict were identified through computer optimization
OWNX	experiments  number  and  number  used a multiple-cue probabilistic category-learning task to convey environmental probabilities
MISC	the crucial manipulation concerned the search-task reward structure
MISC	in experiment  number   in which learning-task feedback corresponded to the true category  people later preferentially searched the accuracy-maximizing feature  whether or not this would improve monetary rewards
MISC	importantly  this feature would have been most useful  under the learning-task payoff structure
OWNX	experiment  number  found that  if words and numbers are used to convey environmental probabilities  neither reward nor accuracy consistently predicts search
MISC	these findings emphasize the necessity of taking into account people's goals and search-and-decision processes during learning  thereby challenging current models of information search
MISC	when diagnosing and treating a patient  when choosing a job candidate or a mate  and in many other situations  one must make decisions without having all the relevant information
MISC	are there widely applicable strategies for identifying useful queries
MISC	what governs people's information search
MISC	a variety of experiments suggest that such models can also provide a reasonable description of human information-search behavior  citation   in situations with no explicit external payoffs
MISC	but in many situations-for instance  when deciding whether something is safe to eat  whether a suspicious suitcase contains a bomb  or whether a patient should be sent to the cardiac care unit-strong asymmetries in consequences for particular correct or incorrect decisions apply
MISC	for instance  a potential cardiac patient should be sent to the cardiac care unit if the risk of heart attack is greater than some threshold
MISC	are there implications  for information search  of varying benefits and costs for different kinds of correct and incorrect decisions
MISC	intuitively  it may seem that the best strategy is to conduct queries that allow determination of the true state of nature as accurately as possible  and to take payoffs into account only in the actual classification decision
MISC	that intuition is distinctly wrong
MISC	in other words  many highly informative tests are useless  given the applicable situation-specific reward structures
MISC	to what extent does people's information-search behavior appropriately reflect the costs or benefits associated with different correct or mistaken decisions
MISC	the environmental reward structure consists of the payoffs for each kind of correct classification decision  and the costs of each kind of incorrect classification decision
MISC	individual true and error theory assumes that responses by the same person to the same choice problem within a block of trials are based on the same true preferences but may show preference reversals due to random error
MISC	between blocks  a person's true preferences may differ or stay the same
MISC	this theory is illustrated with studies testing two critical properties that distinguish models of risky decision making   number  restricted branch independence  which is implied by original prospect theory and violated in a specific way by both cumulative prospect theory and the priority heuristic  and  number  stochastic dominance  which is implied by cumulative prospect theory
MISC	corrected for random error  most individuals systematically violated stochastic dominance  ruling out cumulative prospect theory
MISC	furthermore  most people violated restricted branch independence in the opposite way predicted by that theory and the priority heuristic
MISC	both violations are consistent with the transfer of attention exchange model
MISC	no one was found whose data were compatible with cumulative prospect theory  except for those that were also compatible with expected utility  and no one satisfied the priority heuristic
MISC	when offered a choice  different individuals express different preferences
MISC	for example  given a choice between   number  for sure and a fifty-fifty gamble to win either   number  or   number   some people choose the sure cash and others prefer the gamble
MISC	when the same person is presented with the same choice problem on two occasions  that individual may give two different responses
MISC	given these two phenomena between and within-person variability  it is possible that part or all of what are called individual differences may actually be attributable to variability or  instability  of choice behavior
MISC	furthermore  when we test structural properties of theories  apparent violations of a theory may be due to instability of responses rather than to true flaws in a theory
MISC	therefore  to study individual differences  we need to separate true differences between people from differences that might be due to variation within a person
MISC	this report investigates two critical properties that distinguish models of risky decision making  first order stochastic dominance sd and restricted branch independence rbi
MISC	we apply individual true and error theory itet  which permits separation of random variability from true violations of models of risky decision making
MISC	the mere exposure  or familiarity  effect is the tendency for people to feel more positive about stimuli to which they have previously been exposed
MISC	the eurovision song contest is a two-stage event  in which some contestants in the final will be more familiar to viewers than others
MISC	thus  viewers' voting is likely to be influenced by this effect
OWNX	previous work attempting to demonstrate this effect in this context has been unable to control for contestant quality
MISC	the current study  which used a novel procedure to analyse the way in which contestant countries distributed their points a function of how viewers voted in those countries between  number  and  number   showed that contestants did better if they previously appeared in a semifinal that was seen by voters
MISC	this is evidence that the mere exposure effect  alongside previously studied factors such as cultural and geographical closeness  influences the way viewers vote in the eurovision
MISC	the mere-exposure effect is the tendency for people to like something more as a result of repeated exposure to it  the greater the degree of prior exposure  the more potent the effect
MISC	mere exposure has been most famously studied by robert zajonc and  since his initial studies  has been found to be a tremendously robust effect-one that has been demonstrated in a huge array of different contexts
MISC	for example  zajonc  citation  demonstrated that repeated exposure to nonsense words  chinese ideographs  or photographs was enough to induce positive evaluations of the objects
MISC	subsequent studies have found that familiarity effects also influence liking for sounds  shapes  people  and names  citation
MISC	amongst other things  mere exposure has been shown to affect food preference in infants  citation   ratings of journals by academics  citation   gambling  citation   and voting behaviour in elections  citation
MISC	mere exposure appears to be effective even when the stimuli are presented subliminally  citation
MISC	as already mentioned  the mere-exposure effect has been shown to affect voting behaviour  citation
MISC	olivola and todorov found that both familiarity and perceptions of competency were associated with the share of votes achieved by political candidates in senate elections in the usa
MISC	verhulst et al re-examined this analysis and gave greater primacy to familiarity
MISC	they concluded that perceptions of competency were a mediator of familiarity and suggested that greater familiarity may result in candidates being perceived as more competent
MISC	as judgements of familiarity happen in part at a preconscious level  citation   verhulst et al proposed that perceptions of competency in this context may be a rationalisation of preconscious perceptions of familiarity
MISC	this may be due to the difficulty of measuring exactly how familiar candidates are to voters prior to elections  as well as the myriad uncontrollable extraneous variables that influence the way in which individuals vote
MISC	for example  those who are more likely to win elections receive more press coverage  making them more familiar to voters  citation
MISC	however  prior familiarity with candidates can be well estimated in the eurovision song contest
MISC	the eurovision is a yearly extravaganza in which european countries and some geographically close countries with strong links to europe are represented by a musical act from that country
MISC	the contest is televised and takes place over the course of an evening  during which time viewers can vote for the act which they thought the best
MISC	votes within a country are collated after which each country distributes its points  number - number    number    number  to the various acts countries cannot vote for their own act
MISC	since  number   the eurovision has used a two-stage voting system
MISC	from  number  to  number  there was a single semifinal  during the first stage semifinal  voters were equally unfamiliar with all contestants
MISC	since  number   there have been two semifinals in which all contestant countries bar the host and the four main financial contributors compete to determine who will appear in the final-half in semifinal  number   half in semifinal  number 
MISC	viewer figures consistently show that people are more likely to watch the semifinal in which their own country competes  citation
MISC	this phenomenon means that voters will be more familiar with finalists who appeared in the same semifinal as their own countries
MISC	both formats  citation  allow estimates of familiarity of candidates contestants  estimates that would be very hard to achieve in most studies of real-world voting
MISC	abakoumkin  citation  looked at data from  number - number  and found that those countries that appeared in a semifinal achieved higher marks than those that had not
MISC	although he concluded that this was due to familiarity  it is likely that finalists that had to compete to qualify were of a higher standard than those that did not as weaker entrants would have been weeded out
MISC	voting in the eurovision has been the subject of much debate  and a number of studies have been conducted looking at the way in which countries tend to vote within blocs determined by cultural closeness  citation
MISC	doosje and haslam  citation  identified reciprocal voting patterns  particularly in countries that are more collectivist and economically weaker
MISC	some commentators have argued that factors such as these  which go beyond the  quality  of the songs and performances  undermine the purity of the contest  though others have countered that it is natural for voters to prefer songs from countries with which they share cultural connections  including  presumably  an overlap in musical tastes  citation
MISC	other studies of the eurovision have found that expert judging panels are less affected by these kinds of factors than televoters  citation  and that acts that appear later in the final tend to receive more points  citation
MISC	the current study examines whether the mere-exposure effect also influences voting behaviour
MISC	although this has been researched previously  citation   an inability to account for the quality of competitors means that it is still an open question
MISC	it is assumed that voters will be more familiar with those countries that appeared in the same semifinal as their own and that  consequently  they will be more likely to vote for them
MISC	the construction of social preferences often requires one to reconcile various social motives  such as concern with unfavorable inequality and maximization of social welfare
OWNX	we propose a novel theory whereby people's level of agency influences the relative intensities of their social motives  and thus their social preferences
MISC	agency in this context refers to decision makers' active involvement in the processes that produce social outcomes
MISC	nonagentic decision makers are not involved in creating the outcomes
MISC	therefore  the comparison between self and others is highly informative for them and they shun settings in which their outcome appears to be inferior
MISC	conversely  agentic decision makers  who take action to influence social outcomes  care more about others' outcomes and are more inclined to promote social welfare
OWNX	we report five studies testing the agency hypothesis
MISC	in each scenario  the outcome for oneself was fixed  while the outcome for the other person varied
MISC	the participants' task was to indicate their satisfaction with the other person obtaining either the same outcome as their own or a better one
MISC	after buying a new camera  you find out that a colleague of yours bought the same camera
MISC	you consider the possibility that she might have bought the camera for less than you  so you ask her how much she paid
MISC	would you rather find out that she paid the same price as you  or less
MISC	in particular  you might worry that your outcome would look poorer by comparison and thus you would prefer to find out that she paid the same price  not less
MISC	yet you might hope to find out that she paid less  since this benefits her and does not cost you anything
MISC	decision makers' social preferences in settings like the camera scenario involve a conflict between two social motives-avoidance of inferior social comparisons  and concern about the well-being of others
MISC	thus people's social preferences depend heavily on whether or not they have a role in creating the outcomes
MISC	people tend to be more other-regarding in their preferences to the extent that they have agency in the situation
MISC	the role of agency has been documented in recent studies in which participants were first paid for performing a task in the lab  and were then asked to consider the pay for another matched participant for the same task  citation
MISC	participants in one condition were asked to determine the salary for a matched participant  while participants in another condition were asked to indicate how satisfied they would be with various predetermined salaries for the matched participant
MISC	the participants who chose the outcomes were far more generous than the participants who rated their satisfaction with predetermined outcomes
MISC	in particular  they were more likely to favor the option of paying another participant more than they had received themselves
MISC	choshen-hillel and yaniv  citation  attributed this shift in social preference to participants' level of agency
MISC	individuals are considered  nonagentic  when they experience social outcomes that were not brought about by their intentional actions
MISC	in contrast  individuals are considered  agentic  when they act purposefully to produce social outcomes  with the outcomes being related to their actions
MISC	how might agency affect social preferences
MISC	it has been suggested that individuals are generally sensitive to social comparisons and tend to draw self-inferences based on the differences they observe between themselves and others  citation
MISC	people are said to interpret differences in favor of others as negative signals about their own social status  citation  and consequently tend to shun settings that evoke uncomfortable comparisons  citation
MISC	for individuals who hold agentic roles  however  the balance between the motives changes
MISC	agentic individuals do not view the comparison as conveying important social information  since it is the consequence of their own deliberate action
MISC	being involved in creating the outcomes for others  they also care more about the welfare of others  an effect consistent with the notions of  warm glow   citation  and welfare maximization  citation
MISC	thus  agentic individuals compared with nonagentic ones pay less attention to unfavorable inequalities and care more about maximizing social welfare
MISC	applying this analysis to the camera scenario implies that people should express more other-regarding preferences when they are involved in creating an outcome for the other person than when they are not

MISC	judging near and distant virtue and vice
MISC	journal of experimental social psychology   number    number - number   explored how psychological distance influences moral judgment and found that more extreme moral appraisals were given to distal behaviors rather than proximal behaviors
OWNX	in four experiments using two different priming techniques  we manipulated construal levels and assessed their effects on moral judgment
MISC	high-level consturals elicited less moral outrage toward transgressions and less positive ratings of virtuous behaviors than low-level construals
MISC	a replication study was also conducted to reconcile the inconsistencies between the current results and those of eyal et al possible explanations for the different results between two studies are discussed
OWNX	we can construe the same event in different ways
OWNX	when attending to an object  we can focus on its entire figure  or we can focus on its details
MISC	recent work on construal level theory clt provides a framework of considerable potential by linking mental representations to moral judgment
MISC	clt proposes that the same event or object can be represented at multiple levels of abstraction  citation
MISC	high-level construals are superordinate and decontextualized  and entail constructing abstract conceptualizations of information about objects and events
MISC	by contrast  low-level construals consist of subordinate and contextualized information  represented concretely and in detail
MISC	individuals' judgments  decisions  and behaviors differ as a function of construal levels
MISC	more weight is given to global  abstract features at high-level construals  whereas local  concrete features are more influential at low-level construals
MISC	clt has received a great deal of attention in psychology  and its predictions have been applied to many aspects of human cognition and behavior  citation
MISC	for example  the activation of high-level construals leads to categorization in fewer  broader  and abstract units  whereas activation of low levels leads to categorization in multiple  narrow  and concrete units  citation
MISC	high-level representations are also more coherent and integrative  whereas low-level representations are more specific and disparate  citation
MISC	according to clt  psychological distance is a major determinant of what level of construal is activated
MISC	in general  distancing a target on any dimension of psychological distance i e   time  space  social  and hypotheticality leads to greater activation of high-level construals than low-level construals  citation
MISC	for instance  fujita and colleagues  citation  found that subjects were more likely to describe spatially distant events in terms of goals high-level than in terms of means low-level
MISC	under the framework of clt  eyal et al citation  investigated how psychological distance affects moral judgment
MISC	consider  for instance  an act of sexual intercourse between siblings
MISC	from a distant perspective  one tends to construe it as incest  without considering mitigating details e g   using contraceptives that might tilt moral judgment to be less extreme
MISC	therefore  eyal et al predicted and observed that greater psychological distances were associated with more extreme moral judgments
MISC	the current project tried to build on the eyal et al findings and started with a conceptual replication by more directly manipulating construal levels
MISC	clt indicates that the findings of the effect of psychological distance on people's judgment and decision making should not be a unique effect of psychological distance per se but rather a more general process by which mental representations influence the nature of evaluative objects and decisions
OWNX	in order to establish the robustness of our findings  we conducted another three experiments using different manipulations of construal levels and varied scenarios
MISC	consistent with the initial findings  the converging results suggest that moral judgments are more extreme at lower-level construals than higher-level construals
MISC	the scale has criterion validity  as it is correlated with reported passive risk taking in everyday life  and also has high test-retest reliability
MISC	while correlated with the dospert scale  the prt shows divergent validity from classic risk taking constructs like sensation seeking  and convergent validity with tendencies previously not linked to risk taking  such as procrastination and avoidance
MISC	the simple term  risk taking  suggests that an action is involved when accepting risk
MISC	but in many real life situations risk is also embodied in abstaining from taking action rather than in taking it
MISC	consider the following examples  only  number  percent  of us adults age  number  and older underwent colon cancer screening within the previous  number  years  or used a relevant home test kit within the preceding year-which is partly why less than  number  percent  of colorectal cancers are detected early
MISC	in us states where drivers cannot be pulled over by police solely for not using a seatbelt  number  percent  chose not to wear one  citation
MISC	people who don't undergo the recommended cancer screenings  don't wear seatbelts or don't save for retirement are all taking risks due to their inactions
MISC	the risk taking literature so far has focused predominantly on actions people take that put them at risk  and less attention has been paid to those risks brought on  or greatly magnified  by inaction
MISC	even though grave passive risk choices like not getting cancer screenings  citation  or not saving for retirement  citation  have been at the focus of academic research  they have not been regarded as  risk taking   and have not been analyzed under this theoretical framework
MISC	the concept of  risk  has been extensively studied in the last decades
MISC	there are different definitions for risk  but most distinguish between certain and probable outcomes  marking the  riskier choice  as the one with the greater outcome variance  citation
MISC	study participants are  number  clients of health centers around witbank  south africa
OWNX	our findings suggest that the one-item general measure is the best predictor of risky health behavior in our population  predicting two out of four behaviors at the  number  percent  level and the remaining two behaviors at the  number  percent  level
MISC	the dospert score in the health domain performs well  predicting one out of four behaviors at the  number  percent  significance level and two out of four behaviors at the  number  percent  level  but only if the dospert instrument contains a hypothetical risk-taking item that is similar to the actual risky behavior being predicted
MISC	incentivized monetary gambles and the behavioral task were unrelated to actual health behaviors  they were unable to predict any of the risky health behaviors at the  number  percent  level
OWNX	we conclude by urging researchers to further test the usefulness of the one-item general measure  both in explaining health related risk-taking behavior and in other contexts
MISC	risk taking is part of life  but people differ in their risk-taking propensity
MISC	some people enjoy risky pursuits while others detest such activities
MISC	psychologists and economists have developed various methods to measure an individual's risk-taking propensity
MISC	it is elicited using one survey question that directly asks about risk-taking propensity   how do you see yourself
MISC	are you generally a person who is fully prepared to take risks or do you try to avoid taking risks
MISC	please tick a box on the scale  where the value  number  means 'not at all willing to take risks' and the value  number  means 'very willing to take risks'
MISC	  while straightforward and simple to administer  the dohmen measure has been subject to two concerns
MISC	the first concern relates to domain specificity
MISC	it is generally accepted in psychology that behavior is domain specific and that it is possible for individuals to show different levels of risk-taking propensity depending on the context  citation
MISC	thus  the dohmen measure  being a general measure  may not be able to predict risk taking in the health domain  for example
MISC	this concern is greatly mitigated by dohmen et al citation   who showed the general dohmen measure to be a robust predictor of behavior in different domains  including smoking behavior in the health domain
MISC	the second concern with the dohmen measure is its lack of incentive compatibility
MISC	this issue derives from a general concern that economists have about incentive-compatible measures  in which respondents are presumed to  work harder  more persistently  and more effectively  when money is aligned with performance  citation
MISC	in the case of measuring people's risk-taking propensity  incentive compatibility is usually achieved by giving respondents choices between gambles and paying them for what they choose
MISC	because the dohmen question does not provide incentives to motivate respondents to answer truthfully  respondents may misrepresent their answers
MISC	charness and viceisza  citation   for instance  administered the dohmen question in rural senegal and found the resulting distribution of answers to differ significantly from that found by dohmen et al citation  in germany
MISC	the authors implied that not having aligned incentives was a reason for the discrepancy between the measures found in senegal and in germany  but the authors also alluded to issues related to translation difficulties  including the lack of an equivalent word for  risk  in wolof  the main national language of senegal
MISC	hl is the most common measure of an individual's risk-taking propensity in the economics literature
OWNX	the participant in hl makes ten separate choices between gambles  where each choice entails choosing between a  risky  gamble where high and low payoffs are r number  and r number   respectively  in our study and a  safer  gamble where the high and low payoffs are respectively r number  and r number 
MISC	the probability of obtaining a high vs low payoff in the  risky  gamble is the same as the probability of obtaining a high vs low payoff in the  safer  gamble
MISC	this probability ranges from  number  to  number   number   in increments of  number   number   for the ten sets of choices
MISC	when the probability of the high payoff is high  such as at  number   number   the respondent has a high chance of ending up with r number  under the  risky  option and r number  under the  safer  option  in this case  only the very risk averse would choose the  safer  option
MISC	the point at which the respondent switches from the  safer  option to the  risky  option can be used to calculate a risk aversion index
MISC	because the hl measure is derived using monetary gambles  it is unclear whether a measure derived from a monetary domain is related to risky health behavior
MISC	this question has not been widely studied
MISC	anderson and mellor  citation   using a sample of almost  number   number  mostly college-educated respondents in the u s   found the hl measure to be associated with smoking  heavy drinking  and seat belt non-use-but only at the  number  percent  significance level
MISC	lammers  citation   using a sample of about  number  college students in south africa  found the hl measure to be unrelated to condom use
MISC	the task has  number  trials
MISC	each trial begins with an un-inflated balloon on the screen
MISC	every balloon has a different pre-set level of inflation before it bursts  and the participant does not know the number of clicks that can be made before any balloon bursts
MISC	if  however  the balloon is over-inflated beyond its pre-set level  the balloon bursts and the money for that trial is gone
MISC	the bart task  in essence  measures the actual risk-taking propensity of the individual
MISC	because earnings feedback is given after each trial with either a casino sound when the money is banked  or an explosion noise if the balloon bursts  bart decisions are made in a  hot  psychological state  citation
MISC	hl decisions  by contrast  are made in a  cold  psychological state  because the actual earnings from the hl task are revealed after all choices have been made
MISC	dislich et al citation  use the term  impulsive risk taking  to describe bart and the term  reflective risk taking  to describe a task similar to the hl
MISC	the bart has been shown to be associated with psychological measures of risk taking such as sensation seeking and personality and self-reported behavioral risks including smoking  heavy drinking  drug use  sexual risk taking  gambling  stealing  etc
MISC	citation
MISC	however  that bart is a good predictor of health related risk taking is not a consistent finding in the literature
MISC	reynolds et al citation  found that the bart was uncorrelated with the study's self-reported personality measures related to risk taking
MISC	gordon  citation  found bart to be uncorrelated with attitudes towards risky driving
MISC	dean et al citation  found that smokers did not display greater risk taking on the bart than nonsmokers
MISC	klassen  citation  found that the bart was unrelated to any of the alcohol consumption measures examined
MISC	the dospert asks about one's likelihood to pursue various hypothetical but risky activities in each of five domains financial  ethical  health safety  social  and recreational  and then aggregates the activity-specific risk-taking propensity scores into domain-specific risk-taking propensity scores
MISC	this is in contrast to the dohmen measure  which elicits a single global risk-taking propensity
MISC	the dospert domain scores have been shown to be associated with real-life risk taking in activities within the same domain
MISC	for instance  hanoch et al citation  found that smokers had significantly higher risk-taking propensity scores in the health domain than respondents in a comparison group consisting of gym members  athletes  gamblers  and investors
AIMX	in the current study  we examine dohmen  hl  bart  and dospert measures in a population of clients at health clinics in south africa  and test how these measures relate to health risk taking  in terms of smoking  drinking  seat belt non-use  and risky sexual practices
OWNX	our study makes a few contributions
MISC	numerical predictions are of central interest for both coherence-based approaches to judgment and decisions - the heuristic and biases hb program in particular - and to correspondence-based approaches - social judgment theory sjt
MISC	the theme underlying this review is that both bias-prone heuristics and adaptive heuristics govern subjects' predictions in cpl
MISC	but  as they acquire experience with the prediction task  these heuristics are abandoned and replaced by ecologically valid heuristics
MISC	numerical predictions - predictions in which a single  most appropriate numerical estimation of an outcome is required - are of central interest for both coherence-based and correspondence-based approaches to judgment and decisions
MISC	in the coherence approach  numerical predictions are of central interest to the heuristic and biases hb research program  citation
MISC	the way such predictions are studied in these two traditions is different
MISC	in the sjt tradition they are studied by comparing them to measurable criteria in such a way that their correspondence with the environment can be evaluated
MISC	in particular  in the cue probability learning cpl experimental paradigm  the most popular experimental paradigm in the sjt tradition  subjects learn the environmental relationship between cues predictors and outcomes  and are asked to generate predictions based on their learning
MISC	such a paradigm allows for assessing the validity of the predictions by examining the correlation between the prediction and the true outcome labeled the achievement index
MISC	on the other hand  in the hb tradition  the validity of the predictions is assessed against normative prediction rules
MISC	such predictions violate the basic normative least square law suggesting that predictions ought to be regressive  the higher the predictive validity of the predictor  the higher the extremity
MISC	thus  the research programs associated with these two approaches take different views regarding people's adaptability to their environment
MISC	in particular  whereas sjt highlights people's adaptive behavior  and emphasizes accuracy and ecological rationality  citation   the hb program tends to emphasize biases  error and irrationality  citation
MISC	in particular  in numerical predictions  cpl experiments almost always show that people are able to learn from experience and improve their predictions  citation
MISC	on the other hand  kahneman and tversky  citation  are more pessimistic about people's ability to learn from experience and argue that   regression effects are all about us
MISC	in spite of these encounters  people do not acquire a proper notion of regression   p  number 
MISC	the underlying theme is that both bias-prone heuristics and adaptive heuristics govern subjects' predictions in cpl
MISC	but  as subjects acquire experience with the prediction task  these heuristics are abandoned and replaced by adaptive  environmentally suitable  heuristics  citation
MISC	cue probability learning may be a most suitable experimental paradigm to study the interplay between natural and adaptive heuristics  since in the early phases of a cpl experiment subjects make predictions with no experience  whereas in the later phases they make predictions with abundant experience
MISC	yet very little cpl research has examined this interplay
MISC	the reason  in my view  is that cpl researchers  adhering to the sjt approach  have not been interested in natural  error-prone heuristics  while hb researchers  de-emphasizing the effect of experience  have ignored cue probability learning  which emphasizes people adaptive behavior
MISC	coming from the hb approach  i have also tended to ignore the central role of adaptive heuristics in intuitive prediction  and  despite reliance on cpl as a central experimental paradigm in my work  citation   have emphasized coherence rather than correspondence  heuristics of early rather than later phases  and extremity rather than achievement
MISC	although potentially applicable in every discipline  the amount of training in mathematics that students typically receive varies greatly between different disciplines
MISC	in those disciplines where most researchers do not master mathematics  the use of mathematics may be held in too much awe
OWNX	to demonstrate this i conducted an online experiment with  number  participants  all of which had experience of reading research reports and a postgraduate degree in any subject
MISC	participants were presented with the abstracts from two published papers one in evolutionary anthropology and one in sociology
MISC	based on these abstracts  participants were asked to judge the quality of the research
MISC	the abstract that included the meaningless mathematics tended to be judged of higher quality
MISC	however  this  nonsense math effect  was not found among participants with degrees in mathematics  science  technology or medicine
MISC	in those areas in the social sciences and humanities in which it is broadly recognized that mathematics is a valuable tool  mathematical skills may still be generally too low for optimal use of this tool
MISC	there may be a lack of understanding of what mathematics can and should be used for and what it cannot and should not be used for
MISC	if mathematics is held in awe in an unhealthy way  its use is not subjected to sufficient levels of critical thinking
MISC	the same cannot be said about some other academic disciplines
MISC	this so called  sokal hoax  demonstrated that there are experienced readers of research publications who will not necessarily react adversely to the fact that a text cannot really be made sense of
MISC	indeed  as sokal and bricmont  citation  documented in a book following up on the hoax  obscurity is a hallmark of certain academic traditions associated with terms like postmodernism and relativism
OWNX	however  these science-bashing genres were not responsible for the abuse of mathematics i referred to above  on the contrary  i found mathematics to be poorly used in fields where the tools of science are held in uncritically high regard
MISC	the acceptance and admiration of writing that actually does not make much sense may be found in both camps
MISC	of course  my personal impressions may be biased
MISC	perhaps there is no widespread acceptance and admiration of obscure or nonsensical use of mathematics in the social sciences and humanities  or  if there is  perhaps it is just as widespread in areas like technology and the natural sciences where everyone learns how to use mathematics
MISC	in order to obtain some hard evidence  i conducted an experiment
MISC	participants were presented with two abstracts from published papers in good journals and asked to judge the quality of the research presented in the abstracts
OWNX	one of the two abstracts  randomly chosen  was manipulated by the addition of an extra sentence
MISC	the results showed that  in societies where choice is abundant i e   u s and western europe  maximizers reported less well-being than satisficers  and this difference was mediated by experienced regret
MISC	however  in the non-western society china  maximizing was unrelated to well-being
MISC	these patterns also emerged for the individual facets of the maximizing scale  although with a notable difference between the u s and europe for the high standards facet
MISC	it is argued that  in societies where abundant individual choice is highly valued and considered the ultimate route to personal happiness  maximizers' dissatisfaction and regret over imperfect choices is a detrimental factor in well-being  whereas it is a much less crucial determinant of well-being in societies that place less emphasis on choice as the way to happiness
MISC	autonomy and choice in individual decision making are highly valued in western societies
MISC	greater choice can provide two types of benefits
MISC	first  it can enable choosers to find exactly what they want
MISC	and  secondly  it can enhance their feeling of autonomy and freedom
MISC	nonetheless  various studies have recently cautioned that unlimited choice may come at a price and does not always benefit mental health and well-being  citation
MISC	in this regard  schwartz  citation  argued that  as options are added within a domain of choice  several problems may materialize
MISC	first  the process of collecting adequate and complete information about options makes choosing more laborious
MISC	second  as options expand  people's standards for what is an acceptable outcome rise
MISC	and thirdly  people may come to believe that any imperfect result is their fault  because  with so many options  they have no excuse for not getting the  right  one
MISC	these problems have become especially relevant in contemporary western societies  where people are overwhelmed by near-unlimited options in all domains of life
MISC	in this regard  bellah  madsen  sullivan  swinder  and tipton  citation  already argued that people in western societies feel increasingly uneasy about their life decisions because they are unsure about whether they are making the right choices  and according to schwartz  citation   this  excess of freedom  p  number  has resulted in a dramatic increase in people's dissatisfaction with their lives and even in clinical depression
MISC	however  not everybody may be equally sensitive to the problems that come with exposure to an abundance of choice
MISC	it has been argued that people who always want to maximize the outcomes of their choices are most vulnerable to the negative effects of too much choice  citation
MISC	moreover  there is likely to be a lingering doubt that the best option has nevertheless been missed  especially when it has not been possible to consider all options
MISC	hence  the potential for regret is ever present  because there is always the possibility that there is a better option  out there   and failing to find it means a failure to optimize personal satisfaction
MISC	on the other hand  people can approach choices differently  using a  good enough  strategy  in which any option that meets a certain threshold of acceptability is considered satisfactory
MISC	in this approach to choice  the individual does not have to consider all information about each option  the standards for what is acceptable are more modest meaning that several options can be satisfactory and these standards do not depend on the number of options because adding more options does not suddenly render a good option unacceptable
MISC	moreover  there is no failure in choosing a merely decent  but not perfect  option when adopting a  good enough  approach to choice
MISC	importantly  schwartz et al citation  found considerable  stable individual differences in people's dispositional tendency to use either a  good enough  strategy or a  maximizing  strategy
MISC	people on either side of this dispositional continuum have been labeled satisficers and maximizers  respectively  and the latter group is expected to be more vulnerable to the problems that arise from an excess of choice
MISC	indeed  various studies showed that maximizers experience higher levels of regret compared to satisficers and that they show lower levels of satisfaction with decisions  and lower levels of well-being more generally
MISC	according to the deliberation without attention dwa hypothesis  people facing a difficult choice will make a better decision after a period of distraction than after an equally long period of conscious deliberation  an effect referred to as the unconscious thought advantage uta
MISC	the status of the dwa hypothesis is controversial  as many studies have tried but failed to replicate the uta
OWNX	here  we report a series of experiments that sought to identify the conditions under which the uta can be replicated
OWNX	using a within-subjects design and a task that met each of these conditions  we failed to replicate the uta
OWNX	based on closer inspection of previous methods and findings  we then examined some additional factors that could be important for replicating the uta  including mental fatigue and choice complexity
MISC	this was to no avail  as the results revealed only a significant conscious thought advantage  when choice complexity was increased relative to the first experiment
OWNX	we subsequently conducted exploratory analyses on the data across experiments and found that male subjects showed a significant conscious thought advantage while female subjects showed a trend towards an uta
MISC	taken together  our results suggest that replication of the uta may depend more on characteristics of the sample than on the characteristics of the task  and they suggest that gender could be a source of variance in the outcomes of previous studies using a between-subjects design
MISC	throughout life  people face a variety of decisions that involve choices between options with many relevant attributes
MISC	for instance  in deciding which university program to enroll in  one needs to consider such goals as getting the best possible education  minimizing distance to family and friends  and finding a nice place to live
MISC	but what if you do not have the option of using external aids  and instead have to rely on memory and mental information processing capacity for making complex decisions
MISC	while conventional wisdom suggests that one should think carefully before making a difficult choice  the deliberation without attention dwa hypothesis proposed by dijksterhuis and colleagues  citation  argues otherwise
MISC	specifically this hypothesis claims that complex decisions are best made without conscious deliberation  that is  following a period during which conscious deliberation about the choice at hand is prevented by means of performing an unrelated attention-demanding task
MISC	in support of this hypothesis  dijksterhuis et al citation  reported the results of an experiment that consisted of three phases
MISC	one of the cars had nine positive characteristics whereas two had six and one had only three
MISC	the characteristics were presented one after the other and the subjects were instructed to form a thorough impression of each car
MISC	following this information acquisition phase  one group of subjects was told they had four minutes to think carefully about the options before they would be asked to make a choice
MISC	this comprised the  conscious thought  condition
MISC	the other group was told they would first have to do another task-solving anagrams-for four minutes before they would be asked to make a choice
MISC	this comprised the  unconscious thought  condition
MISC	the results of this between-subjects comparison showed that the subjects in the unconscious thought condition performed better than those in the conscious deliberation condition  with the latter performing at chance in picking out the best car
MISC	in other words  subjects who were given the opportunity to think about the cars made worse choices than those who did not think about the cars due to the distracting task
MISC	this hypothesis claims that the processing of the earlier presented information will continue at an unconscious level during the execution of the distracting task  effectively producing a preference that will guide one's decision when a choice eventually needs to be made
MISC	to explain why this unconscious form of deliberation produces better choices than conscious deliberation  dijksterhuis and colleagues further proposed that unconscious thought has a much greater capacity for processing information than conscious thought
MISC	hence  unconscious thought would be better suited for dealing with complex decisions and  as a consequence  momentary distraction would result in an unconscious thought advantage uta in case of decisions involving many options with many characteristics of relevance
MISC	in claiming that people should rely on unconscious processing to make better choices  the dwa hypothesis readily attracted attention from the public media  and it readily attracted criticism from other scientists
MISC	dijksterhuis' claims were considered misleading and potentially harmful  citation   and researchers were quick to offer alternative explanations for the uta  citation
MISC	nevertheless  the unconscious thought paradigm took flight as researchers started to investigate the boundary conditions of the uta
MISC	this work indicated that the uta is not a very robust phenomenon as many studies failed to replicate it  in spite of using similar methods to those that dijksterhuis used  citation
MISC	at the same time  however  dijksterhuis and other researchers produced a number of replications and extensions of the uta  citation
MISC	of these experiments   number  replicated the uta in some form  while  number  showed no significant difference in performance  and four showed significantly better performance in the conscious thought condition  that is  a conscious thought advantage cta
MISC	given that most of the experiments listed in table  number  used methods and materials similar to those used by dijksterhuis  citation   an intriguing question is why the results of these experiments could be so inconsistent
MISC	to address this matter  strick and dijksterhuis and colleagues conducted a meta-analysis on a comprehensive collection of published and unpublished datasets  and they examined a number of methodological details that differed between studies  citation
MISC	the results showed that averaged across studies  the uta remained significant with a pooled effect size of  number 
MISC	more importantly  the results also showed that there are indeed quite a few methodological details that have a significant influence the magnitude of the uta
MISC	these moderators not only pertained to the nature of the choices that had to be made  but also to manner in which the information acquisition and deliberation phases were implemented in different studies
MISC	specifically  the analysis by strick et al showed that effect sizes were larger in studies that employed more complex decisions  as predicted by the dwa hypothesis
MISC	with regard to the deliberation phase  the analysis showed that the uta was stronger when the duration of this phase was relatively short  and when the task used to distract subjects in the unconscious thought condition involved solving word-search puzzles instead of solving anagrams  or performing a verbal working memory task
MISC	across both experiments  when given a monetary incentive to succeed  the adoption of a narrow perspective increased cheating  as evidenced by overall higher reported success rates
MISC	dishonest behavior seems pervasive
MISC	for example  the estimated total damage to the american clothing industry from wardrobing-the habit of returning purchased clothes after wearing  amounts to   number  billion annually  citation   and the damage to us companies from employee theft and fraud reaches an estimate of   number  billion a year  citation
MISC	on an individual level  research on lying has found that people lie in some  number  percent  of their daily interactions  citation
MISC	in stark contrast to these findings  most people  including those who engage in the above practices  maintain a positive moral self-concept  citation
MISC	if being moral is so highly valued in society  why then is unethical behavior so pervasive
MISC	and what determines its extent
MISC	basic research in decision making shows that preferences are highly affected by normatively irrelevant factors such as the framing of the problem  the method of elicitation and the context in which the decision is made  citation
MISC	participants had a more intense negative affective reaction when they were exposed to a highly negative life experience than when they were exposed to two negative events  a highly negative and a mildly negative life event
MISC	participants also chose the situation containing two versus one negative event
MISC	in addition  participants chose the situation having one versus two negative life experiences
MISC	these results are consistent with an averaging summation a s model and delineate situations when  more  negative life events are  better  and when  more  negative life events are  worse
MISC	 more is worse  when it comes to negative life events
MISC	this is a conclusion that follows from behavioral approaches
MISC	from behavioral accounts  the addition of a negatively valenced stimulus to an already negatively valenced context should reduce approach and preference tendencies  citation
MISC	the averaging summation a s model  citation  demonstrated that individuals' feelings and preferences are sometimes  but not always  the sum of the affective values associated with each event  for example  individuals may not always feel more negative after experiencing a compound event containing both a highly negative plus mildly negative event than they feel after experiencing a singular highly negative one
MISC	the model incorporates findings in the judgment and social-influence literatures  citation
MISC	from the a s model  averaging effects are not relegated to the judgment domain and summation effects are not relegated to the social influence domain
MISC	rather  individuals' responses reflect sensitivity to the sum of the values associated with each event as well as to central seeking tendencies - the average value of events
OWNX	see the appendix for a quantitative expression of this model
MISC	an experimental test of the descriptive adequacy of the restated diversification principle is presented
MISC	the principle postulates that risk-averse utility maximizers will pool risks for their mutual benefit  even if information is missing about the probabilities of losses
MISC	it is enough for people to assume that they face equal risks when they pool risks
MISC	in a nutshell  the diversification principle says that  if risk-averse utility maximizers can choose between two assets with identical but random returns  they will prefer to invest half of their endowment in each asset  citation
MISC	the principle can be paraphrased in the following means  if two risk-averse utility maximizers with assets of the same value face the same distributions of potential losses  they will gain by sharing the potential losses equally  citation
MISC	the restated diversification principle holds for any distribution of outcomes  as long as the distribution is the same for both people
MISC	it does not matter whether the probability of a loss is small or large  in both cases  the people gain by sharing the loss
MISC	this implies that sharing loss is also mutually favorable if information is missing about the probabilities of losses
MISC	it is not even necessary that the distribution of outcomes is the same for both people  it is enough that they both accept that there is no reason to assume that their probabilities of losses differ presumption of equality
MISC	possible differences can therefore be neglected if there is no knowledge about them
MISC	when information about the probabilities of losses is missing  mutual sharing of losses may be superior to insurance since an insurance premium is normally based on technical or actuarial information on the probability of losses
MISC	without such information  the pricing will become arbitrary and the negotiation cost may be large
MISC	insurance under apparent ambiguity  when information about the probabilities of losses is lacking  may not be possible at all  citation
MISC	loss-sharing  however  can be undertaken without pricing the potential loss
MISC	the restated diversification principle was first presented by skogh  citation  in the case of two identical pool members
MISC	skogh and wu  citation  generalized the principle to the case where individuals' losses differ in amount or in probability and to the case where individuals' attitudes toward risks differ
OWNX	in particular we test the following two hypotheses      h number    under apparent ambiguity  people will share potential losses
MISC	this study employs a discrete choice experiment dce in the health-care sector to test the loss aversion theory that is derived from reference-dependent preferences  the absolute subjective value of a deviation from a reference point is generally greater when the deviation represents a loss than when the same-sized change is perceived as a gain
MISC	another advantage of a dce is that is can be applied to non-traded goods with non-tangible attributes
MISC	seven hypotheses are presented and tested
MISC	overall  significant support for behavioral loss aversion theories was found
MISC	a person's valuation of the benefit from an outcome of a choice is often determined by the intrinsic  consumption utility  of the outcome itself  combined with its contrast with a reference point
MISC	the most noteworthy manifestation of such reference-dependent preferences is loss aversion  the absolute subjective value of a change in an endowment is generally greater when the deviation from the reference point represents a loss than when the same-sized change is perceived as a gain
MISC	the most systematic general theory of this kind is probably tversky and kahneman's  citation  reference-dependence model  which builds on kahneman and tversky's  citation  prospect theory
MISC	the significance of loss aversion is highlighted in camerer's  citation  review of the practical implications of prospect theory  seven out of the ten examples are derived from the loss aversion hypothesis
MISC	recently  koszegi and rabin  citation  presented an extended model of reference-dependent preferences and loss aversion  which is claimed to be more generally applicable
MISC	numerous studies present evidence supporting the loss aversion hypothesis
MISC	they include  hartman et al citation   hardie et al citation   andreoni  citation   benartzi and thaler  citation   camerer et al citation   myagkov and plott  citation   bowman et al citation   jullien and salanie  citation   genesove and mayer  citation
MISC	there are also several studies that are looking at loss aversion in the medical domain
MISC	they include  stalmeier and bezembinder  citation   robinson et al citation   bleichrodt and pinto  citation   van osh et al citation
MISC	what is the reference point that is used by the individual to evaluate gains positive deviations versus losses negative deviations
MISC	expectations were mentioned by other researchers as candidates for the reference point  shalev  citation  used expectations in his game-theoretic model  and koszegi and rabin  citation  assumed that a person's reference point is her rational expectations held in the recent past about outcomes
MISC	they specified a rule for the endogenous derivation of this point  within the framework of an equilibrium utility-maximizing model
MISC	van osch et al citation  argued that goals aspirations influence the reference point in the health domain
OWNX	combining qualitative and quantitative data they provided evidence of the reference point in life-year certainty equivalent ce gambles and explored the psychology behind the reference point
MISC	this empirical study takes a new and different approach to the determination of the reference point and the testing of the loss aversion hypothesis
MISC	discrete choice experiments dces are used for the estimation of a preference structure for a multi-dimensional consumption good or service  by establishing the relative importance of different attributes in the provision of the good service under discussion  vis-a-vis a constant reference bundle
MISC	the decomposition into attribute-specific components adds richness and insight  it is not obvious that people are loss averse regarding all kinds of attributes and there are most probably different degrees of loss aversion  which can be compared across attributes
MISC	their preferences for five maternity-ward attributes number of beds in hospital room  attitude of staff toward the patient  medical staff's professionalism  information transfer from staff to patients  and travel time from residence to hospital were estimated and loss aversion was tested for each of the attributes separately
MISC	the results were less conclusive for  travel time from residence to hospital
OWNX	 the following section describes the dce method employed for estimation
OWNX	the third section presents the econometric model  followed by the hypotheses derived from the loss aversion theory
OWNX	the preference structures used to test the outlined hypotheses are presented in section  number 
MISC	subjects performed a decision task  citation  in both a well-rested and experimentally sleep-deprived state
OWNX	we found two main results   number  final choice accuracy was unaffected by sleep deprivation  and yet  number  the estimated decision model differed significantly following sleep-deprivation
MISC	following sleep deprivation  subjects placed significantly less weight on new information in forming their beliefs
MISC	because the altered decision process still maintains decision accuracy  it may suggest that increased accident and error rates attributed to reduced sleep in modern society stem from reduced auxiliary function performance e g   slowed reaction time  reduced motor skills or other components of decision making  rather than the inability to integrate multiple pieces of information
MISC	the nightly average was  number   number  hours in  number  and  number  hours per night in  number   citation
MISC	this trend has significant implications given the known effects of sleep deprivation  decreased motor and cognitive performance  reduced vigilance and reaction time  worsened mood  and reduced ability to think flexibly  citation
MISC	indeed  even  number  hours of habitual sleep per night leads to significantly diminished cognitive performance relative to  number  or  number  hours  citation   which causes us to wonder about the more hidden decision effects of sleep loss
MISC	many occupations promote a culture of sleep deprivation e g   emergency personnel  air traffic controllers  medical residents  military personnel  long-haul truck drivers  shift workers
MISC	sleep deprivation costs the u s economy   number  billion dollars annually in lost productivity  citation
MISC	additionally  it results in increased workplace accident rates  citation   increased absenteeism  citation   greater medical morbidity and related costs  citation   and even slower career advancement  citation
MISC	across numerous settings work  home  driving  public accidents leger  citation  estimated the costs of accidents attributable to sleepiness at   number -  number  billion  in  number  dollars
MISC	sleep deprivation has also been implicated in several major historical disasters  including the space shuttle challenger explosion  the exxon valdez oil spill  and the chernobyl nuclear plant explosion  citation
MISC	in sum  the impact of sleep deprivation in the workplace and on society as a whole  while difficult to measure precisely  is massive
MISC	examinations of flexible thinking  strategy updating  and risk assessment are relatively new to sleep research  citation
MISC	past research has utilized complex multi-modal tasks or operational settings that cannot identify specific aspects of decision-making affected by sleep deprivation
MISC	for example  harrison and horne  citation  utilize a marketing simulation game  and they report that  number  hours of total sleep deprivation led to stereotyped decisions failing to integrate previous feedback  resulting in large financial losses and production errors
MISC	in operational settings  similarly global outcome measures are reported  citation
MISC	a recent meta-analysis of  number  studies found that  clinical outcomes   the culmination of many decisions  were negatively impacted by physician sleep loss  citation
MISC	even the well-known iowa gambling task igt  which has been used to examine risky choice behavior in the sleep literature  citation   does not allow the researcher to separate risk attitude from subjective probability formation - the latter results from the fact that there is missing information with respect to outcome probabilities in the igt
MISC	mckenna et al citation  addressed this issue and showed that sleep deprivation desensitizes the decision-maker to risk
MISC	in general  the mechanism by which sleep deprivation alters decision making remains unclear
MISC	given that many real-world decisions involve multiple cognitive processes  it is important to separately examine several of those components in an effort to determine which may be specifically impacted by sleep deprivation and which may not
MISC	the studies examining risk preference cited above are examples of such work
MISC	another process found in many decisions is the ability to integrate multiple pieces of information into a decision
MISC	sleep deprivation might alter subject tendencies to utilize one or more pieces of information in decision-making
MISC	or  the arrival of new information may elicit an impulsive response as subjects react to new evidence  and this impulse may be altered following sleep deprivation
MISC	the current study examines this specific aspect of decision-making through the study of bayesian updating
MISC	one can examine the effects of sleep deprivation on the ability to integrate information into a decision from at least two perspectives  each with their own strengths and weaknesses
OWNX	one involves asking whether individuals can calculate the true bayesian probability given base rate probabilities and new sample evidence
MISC	this requires asking subjects for their judgment of the actual probability of event a occurring and  therefore  focuses on finding the  ideal  answer to a problem
MISC	such a scenario is more aligned with many naturally-occurring decision environments in everyday life
MISC	for example  one may have to decide which of two routes to a destination is faster right now given the prior knowledge of the rate of traffic on each route and the new information of the current day and time
MISC	a surgeon may have to decide to perform an emergency procedure given prior knowledge of the relative success of the procedure and the new information of the current condition of the patient
MISC	in short  when individuals make real decisions  they must often choose a specific course of action i e   a dichotomous choice rather than a probability estimate
MISC	because information updating is a fundamental component of decision making under uncertainty  this research is relevant to a wide variety of behavioral applications
MISC	sleep research has indirectly pointed towards failed information assimilation under sleep deprivation  citation
MISC	however  more direct evidence is needed  and harrison and horne  citation  recognize the lack of sleep deprivation research on specific decision models
MISC	as behavioral economics continues to explore decision-making  one cannot ignore the evidence indicating that many decision-makers are often sleep-deprived to some degree
MISC	ninety-eight australian students participated in a functional replication of a study published by dijksterhuis et al citation
MISC	it suggests that there is little evidence for an advantage to normative decision making using unconscious thought
MISC	in a series of studies  dijksterhuis and colleagues  citation  established the surprising and counterintuitive finding that unconscious thought leads to better decision making performance for complex problems than conscious thought
MISC	unconscious thought is defined as  cognitive and  or affective task-relevant processes that take place outside conscious awareness   citation
MISC	a second postulate is that the reverse is true for simple decision  consciously thinking about them is better
MISC	for example  an attribute of all choice options for  apartments  might be the size
MISC	typically these attributes are conceptualized dichotomously - either an apartment is spacious or it is not
MISC	all pieces of information about all choice options are presented either as lists e g   newell  wong  cheung   and  rakow  in press  individually and randomized e g   this study  or individually in a fixed order  citation  for a fixed amount of time
MISC	prior to the information presentation  participants are informed that they will have to a choose one of the options  citation  or b rate each option e g   lerouge  submitted
MISC	then  following the presentation of the information  participants either immediately make a choice between options or think about their choice for a fixed amount of time  citation   or are distracted for the same amount of time before making their decision
MISC	the principal claim is that  when the number of factors that ought to be considered is high as indicated by the number of attributes  and the decision is therefore complex  unconscious thought will lead to better decision performance than conscious deliberation
MISC	better decision making which i call  normative  here is defined as choosing  or ranking higher  options with more positive features
OWNX	however  although most of dijksterhuis and colleagues' experiments found an effect in the hypothesized direction  such effects often failed to reach statistical significance when comparing the unconscious and conscious group directly
MISC	for example  in the first reported experiment in dijksterhuis'  number  study the critical comparison did not reach statistical significance p  less than    number 
MISC	in this context it is important to point out that in the sequence of experiments carried out by dijksterhuis  only the first two to be published  citation  were exclusively directed at establishing differences between decision success under unconscious versus conscious thought
MISC	the other experiments primarily investigated further aspects of what was to become the theory of unconscious thought  citation
MISC	for example  experiments  number  and  number  of dijksterhuis  bos  nordgren  and van baaren's  citation  study dealt with the deliberation without attention effect  which required two conditions  a complex and a simple one  which were differentiated by the number of information bits participants received
MISC	however  even though these studies did not primarily contrast conscious with unconscious thought  they frequently provided data supporting the notion that unconscious thought is a superior form of integrating a large amount of information
MISC	conscious thought  according to dijksterhuis  is very useful for monitoring information with respect to a particular criterion  for example the minimal amount of space that must be available in an apartment
MISC	it can engage in logical operations and work with quantities in a precise fashion  as is the case in mathematical operations
MISC	on the other hand  it has limited capacity and is thus unsuitable to integrate large amounts of information
MISC	unconscious thought  on the other hand  is claimed to possess virtually infinite processing capacity  to process information divergently and to employ a natural weighing mechanism for acquired information
MISC	despite its empirical successes and its advanced conceptual development  the theory of unconscious thought has not been without criticism
MISC	shanks  number   for example claimed that the unconscious thought effects were an artefact of differential rates of forgetting rather than the product of different forms of processing
MISC	the theory was also criticised for limited sample size in supporting studies  and concern was voiced about the applicability of the theory to the clinical context  citation  for which  as dijksterhuis and colleagues pointed out  the theory was not intended
MISC	the first aim is to provide replication data for the unconscious decision making effect with an english-speaking sample and english stimulus material
MISC	i show how the coherence correspondence distinction can inform the conversation about decision methods for engineering design
MISC	some engineers argue for the application of multi-attribute utility theory while others argue for what they call heuristics
MISC	by analyzing statements in the design literature  i argue that utility theory aims at achieving coherence and heuristics aim at achieving correspondence
MISC	it is important to provide an answer because while in design the objective is correspondence  it is difficult to assess it  and coherence that is easier to assess is used as a surrogate
MISC	i argue that coherence does not always imply correspondence in design and that this is also the case in problems studied in judgment and decision-making research
MISC	uncovering the conditions under which coherence implies  or does not imply  correspondence is a topic where engineering design and judgment and decision-making research might connect
MISC	it is important to keep this distinction in mind when comparing decision methods because one method could be achieving coherence while another method could be achieving correspondence
MISC	for example  the take-the-best heuristic  citation  violates a criterion of coherence transitivity that is satisfied by linear regression  while  under some conditions  take-the-best outperforms regression in a criterion of correspondence predictive accuracy
MISC	in this article  i show how the coherence correspondence distinction can inform the conversation about decision methods within a field that has had minimal overlap with jdm judgment and decision making  the field of engineering design
MISC	in  number   national science foundation nsf engineering design program director george hazelrigg wrote   it is increasingly recognized that engineering design  is a  decision-intensive process  p  number 
MISC	the nsf has  since  number   sponsored numerous workshops on decision-based design
MISC	the accreditation board for engineering and technology also defines engineering design as a decision-making process
MISC	what decisions do design engineers make
MISC	design engineers choose among alternative concepts
MISC	a design concept is a technical specification of an artifact that is detailed enough so that the engineer can predict  reasonably accurately  how the artifact will function
MISC	there are typically many attributes on which design concepts can be evaluated
MISC	hereafter  i refer to design concepts as simply designs
MISC	some engineers  citation  argue for the application of multi-attribute utility theory for choosing among designs  while others argue for what they call heuristics  such as stuart pugh's convergence process  citation
MISC	this debate has by and large ignored the coherence correspondence distinction
MISC	the first question is whether each method aims at achieving coherence or correspondence or both
MISC	by analyzing published statements in the design literature  i argue that multi-attribute utility theory aims at achieving coherence while the pugh convergence process aims at achieving correspondence
MISC	it is important to answer because while in design the objective of decision-making is correspondence  it is difficult to assess it  and coherence that is easier to assess is used as a surrogate
MISC	i argue that coherence does not always imply correspondence in design  and that this is also the case in decision problems studied in jdm
MISC	before asking and answering the two questions  i review two methods for making decisions that have a prominent place in engineering design theory and practice
MISC	anchoring effects  the assimilation of numerical estimates to previously considered standards  are highly robust
MISC	two studies examined whether mood and expertise jointly moderate the magnitude of anchoring
MISC	previous research has demonstrated that happy mood induces judges to process information in a less thorough manner than sad mood  which means that happy judges tend to be more susceptible to unwanted influences
MISC	however  this may not be true for anchoring effects
MISC	because information processing of experts may be relatively independent of their mood  however  mood may influence anchoring only in non-experts
MISC	results of two studies on legal decision-making study  number  and numeric estimates study  number  are consistent with these expectations
MISC	human judgment is shaped by affective influences
MISC	how people judge and evaluate a given target critically depends on how they feel  citation
MISC	judges' mood  for example  influences how they judge their own lives  citation   other persons  citation   or the frequency of risks  citation
MISC	these effects might occur because judges tend to use their mood as information in the judgment process  citation
MISC	however  moods influence human judgments not only because they are used directly as information  but also because they exert a more indirect influence by changing how judges process information
MISC	in particular  judges who are in a happy mood tend to process information in a more superficial or heuristic manner  whereas those in a sad mood tend to process information more thoroughly  citation
MISC	for example  judges in a happy mood rely more on the use of stereotypes  citation  and other heuristic strategies  citation  than judges in a sad mood  citation
MISC	to the extent that the use of such heuristic strategies leads to judgmental biases  citation   these findings suggest that happy judges are typically less accurate and more biased than sad judges
MISC	however  there appears to be at least one notable exception to this rule - judgmental anchoring
OWNX	three experiments demonstrate how the processing of negations is contingent on the evaluation context in which the negative information is presented
MISC	in addition  the strategy used to process the negations induced different affective reactions toward the stimuli  leading to inconsistency of preference
MISC	alternatives were presented for either joint je or separate evaluation se
MISC	experiment  number  revealed that the non-negative stimuli induced a less clear and less positive feeling when they were paired with explicitly positive stimuli rather than evaluated separately
MISC	non-negative options were also found less easy to judge than the positive ones in je but not in se
OWNX	through a memory task  we found that in je people process the non-negative attributes as negations of negative features  whereas in se they directly process the non-negative attributes as positive features
MISC	for instance  if a person tells you that  a cereal for breakfast is not high in fat  you may either think that it is low in fat or moderately fatty
MISC	therefore  the above sentence leaves room for interpretations  since it explicitly communicated what is not present lot of fats but does not tell how lean those cereals are
OWNX	we hypothesize that the affective reactions induced by non-negative information e g   a cereal that is not high in fat are contingent on the evaluation context in which the negation is presented
OWNX	in particular  we aim to show that the effect of the evaluation context on the affective reactions is induced by the different ways negations are processed  depending on whether an explicitly positive comparison in the form of an affirmative sentence is present or not
MISC	such an inconsistency of preference may have important implications in several domains like  for instance  personnel selection and products advertisement
MISC	numerous studies in the last few decades have shown a strong link between people's affective reactions and their subsequent behaviors
MISC	citation  therefore  if the context in which a negation is evaluated may influence individuals' feelings then it may also affect their actual choices
MISC	there has been a long debate on how negations are actually processed and whether they increase the accessibility of information congruent with the actual state of affairs  the cereal is not high in fat  or the negated state of affairs  the cereal is high in fat   citation
MISC	such a debate led to the elaboration of two models that offer completely different accounts of the way negations are processed  citation
MISC	the first model is closer to the explanation offered by the propositional theories of language comprehension  citation
MISC	this model is called the  schema-plus-tag  model  citation
MISC	it states that individuals process a negation by processing the core message the schema  e g   the cereal is high in fat and then complete it with the negation tag
MISC	as stated by mayo et al citation   this model entails two important implications
MISC	the first  is that people process the core schema and attach a negation tag to it  therefore allowing for a dissociation between them at a later point in time
MISC	the second implication pertains to the associations that the schema activates  which should be congruent with the negated state of affairs high in fat instead of being consistent with the actual state of affairs not high in fat
MISC	as a consequence  they end up understanding the negation and its meaning but at the same time they activate a series of associations that are incongruent with the intended meaning of the negation
MISC	alternatively  the proposers of the experiential-simulation model suggested a second way to process a negation  that is by fusing the negation tag into the core schema
MISC	the main consequence of using this model is that fusing the negation with the core concept allows people to activate associations that are congruent with the actual state of affairs
MISC	therefore  the fusion model should reinforce the intended meaning of the message and make it more convincing
MISC	they suggested that the negation tag should inhibit the activation of concepts that are congruent with the negated state of affairs
MISC	more recently  kaup et al citation  suggested an alternative mechanism which may account for the negation tag-core schema fusion process
MISC	instead  people should be able to juxtapose the two representations so that they can take into account the negated information
MISC	mayo et al citation  suggested that individuals might use either the schema-plus-tag model or the fusion model depending on the inferences allowed by the sentence in which the negation is included
MISC	in particular  mayo and colleagues found that the existence of a schema that accommodates the meaning of the original negation is critical in determining how a negation will be encoded
OWNX	in the present study  we aim to show that the use of either one or the other model may be contingent on the context in which the negation is presented
OWNX	in a series of three studies we asked participants to judge explicitly positive stimuli characterized by having positive features and non-negative stimuli characterized by not having negative features
MISC	participants were presented with either one or both options  thereby using a joint je versus separate se evaluation paradigm
MISC	previous studies have demonstrated numerous ways in which preferences elicited in je and se are inconsistent  citation
MISC	both a message saying that a cereal is  not high in fat  and a message saying that a cereal is  fat-free  communicate a similar  non-negative  value i e   in both cases the cereal does not have a lot of fat and this is positive for people's health but in different ways
MISC	the difference appears to depend on how the negation is processed in joint versus separate evaluation
MISC	a questionnaire in which the subjects are asked about the reasons for their decision shows that  at least in this case  moral motivations carry a heavy weight in the decision  the majority of dictators give the money for reasons of a consequentialist nature
MISC	in standard dictator game dg experiments  one of the players  the dictator  is given a fixed amount of money and a set of instructions
MISC	the instructions explain that the money has been assigned to two players - the dictator and the recipient - but that only the dictator is entitled to decide how much money to keep and how much money to give to the recipient
MISC	in this simple situation  there are at least three sources of information relevant to the decision  i information related to the dictator herself  i e   whether or not the decision is observed by others  ii information the dictator receives about the recipient  and iii information derived from the game framing and the language used in the instructions
MISC	previous papers have shown that the outcome of a dg changes considerably depending on the type of information provided by the experimenters
MISC	for instance  when the dictator makes the decision under conditions of absolute privacy and anonymity and has no information about the recipient  nearly no one donates anything
MISC	donations tend to be very low  around  number  percent  of the pie on average  citation
MISC	however  when the dictator receives reliable information regarding the recipient  even while keeping anonymity constant  donations increase
MISC	when no information is available about the recipient  the dictator may have doubts as to the recipient's existence and therefore have no reason to share the money
MISC	in contrast  when dictators were shown pictures of the recipients in a particular experiment  up to  number  percent  of the subjects gave as much as half of the total amount  although  number  percent  of them kept all the money for themselves  citation
OWNX	thirty-one percent of the dictators in this experiment gave part of the money  number  percent  gave half of the amount  while  number  percent  gave the full amount
MISC	offers also increased when the dictators were told the recipient's surname  citation   when they received proof of the actual existence of recipients  or when they were told that the recipient was a fellow classmate  citation
MISC	the language used in the instructions is yet another factor that may determine the outcome of the experiment
MISC	the nature of the payments  the presence or absence of the experimenters  the possibility of taking part in future experiments - and thus winning more money - may also determine the outcome  citation
MISC	the aim of these experiments is to measure the prosocial conduct or other-regarding preferences revealed by the subjects  thus challenging the assumption of self-interested behavior
MISC	the supposition that individuals will attempt to maximize their own benefits  a standard assumption in economics  could lead to the conclusion that no one will give anything in the dg since giving nothing is the behavior that maximizes the dictator material's payoff
MISC	in light of these experimental results  several hypotheses have been developed to explain these deviations
MISC	hoffman et al citation  show that as anonymity is relaxed  donations increase
MISC	in the opinion of these authors  this is due to the fact that anonymity generates  social distance   which they define as  the degree of reciprocity that subjects believe exists within a social interaction   citation
MISC	the social isolation or lack of sense of community produced by anonymity leads to the predominance of self-interested behavior
MISC	nonetheless  the hypothesis of social distance has been widely criticized
MISC	the concept of reciprocity  for example  is employed in a very broad sense since in reality the dg does not pose so much a problem of reciprocity - in that the recipient can do nothing- as one of subject identifiability
MISC	indeed  it is identifiability that determines behavior  citation
MISC	many experiments have shown that it is not so much the degree of dictator anonymity that determines donations  but rather the information that the dictator has about the recipient
MISC	thus  for example  in an extensive article in which several hypotheses are reviewed to explain donations in dictator games and others are proposed  bolton et al citation  argue that  if i know nothing about the other person and if i give her the money  i can err in her favor  but i prefer to err in my favor because i am not a saint the  i'm-no-saint hypothesis 
MISC	according to these authors  however  the hypotheses that explain dg donations are unclear when the dictator has information about the recipient
MISC	in the classic hoffman et al citation  experiment  and in most experiments along these lines  the complete lack of information about the recipient removes the necessary conditions to donate out of a sense of moral obligation if  as eckel  and  grossman have shown  altruistic behavior requires an appropriate context  which is inexistent in most experiments  what would happen if the dictator makes a decision in an easily recognizable moral context  a context in which dictators have information  for example  about their partner's poverty or illness
MISC	in eckel  and  grossman's experiment  in which the partner is the red cross  donations increase  but not in a spectacular way
MISC	donations increase much more when the money that the dictator can distribute is the result of the joint effort of both the dictator and the partner  given that  in this case   social pressures  moral imperatives  and the warm glow of giving are likely to magnify the reward to skillful or deserving recipients   citation
MISC	as ruffle points out  the results of this experiment contradict hoffman et al 's claim that other-regarding preferences have to do with  an expectations phenomenon  and not with  an autonomous private preference for equity   citation
MISC	moral preferences  the sense of moral obligation  moral imperatives or equity appear repeatedly in discussions on the outcomes of a diverse range of dg experiments
OWNX	indeed  aside from the theoretical speculations of experimenters  we do not know why dictators give
OWNX	with a view to bridging this gap  in the following section we present two experiments a hypothetical one and a real-payoffs one in which the moral context is easily recognizable and in which dictators are expressly asked about the reasons for their action
MISC	most people are caring and will exert great effort to rescue individual victims whose needy plight comes to their attention
MISC	these same good people  however  often become numbly indifferent to the plight of individuals who are  one of many  in a much greater problem
MISC	why does this occur
MISC	every episode of mass murder is unique and raises unique obstacles to intervention
OWNX	but the repetitiveness of such atrocities  ignored by powerful people and nations  and by the general public  calls for explanations that may reflect some fundamental deficiency in our humanitya deficiency that  once identified  might possibly be overcome
MISC	i shall draw from psychological research to show how the statistics of mass murder or genocide  no matter how large the numbers  fail to convey the true meaning of such atrocities
OWNX	recognizing that we cannot rely only upon our moral feelings to motivate proper action against genocide  we must look to moral argument and international law
MISC	my title is taken from a statement by mother teresa   if i look at the mass i will never act
MISC	most people are caring and will exert great effort to rescue  the one  whose needy plight comes to their attention
MISC	these same good people  however  often become numbly indifferent to the plight of  the one  who is  one of many  in a much greater problem
MISC	why does this occur
MISC	the answer to this question will help us answer a related question  why do good people ignore mass murder and genocide
MISC	there is no simple answer
OWNX	we cannot simply blame our political leaders
MISC	although president bush has been quite unresponsive to the murder of hundreds of thousands of people in darfur  it was clinton who ignored rwanda  and roosevelt who did little to stop the holocaust
MISC	behind every president who ignored mass murder were millions of citizens whose indifference allowed them to get away with it
MISC	it's not fear of losing american lives in battle that necessarily deters us from acting
OWNX	we have not even taken quite safe steps that could save many lives  such as bombing the radio stations in rwanda that were coordinating the slaughter by machete of  number   number  people in  number  days  or supporting the forces of the african union in darfur  or just raising our powerful american voices in a threatening shoutstop that killing
MISC	- as opposed to turning away in silence
MISC	every episode of mass murder is unique and raises unique social  economic  military  and political obstacles to intervention
OWNX	but the repetitiveness of such atrocities  ignored by powerful people and nations  and by the general public  calls for explanations that may reflect some fundamental deficiency in our humanitya deficiency that  once identified  might possibly be overcome
MISC	many researchers have begun to study the  dance of affect and reason  as it applies to decision making
OWNX	i shall conclude with suggestions about how we might make genocide  feel real  and motivate appropriate interventions
MISC	although i have attempted to fashion a compelling explanation for genocide neglect that has implications for action  the story is not complete
MISC	the psychological account  while based on theory and recent empirical studies  clearly needs further testing and development  particularly to examine more directly the relationship between imagery  affect  and sensitivity to numbers
OWNX	we propose a constructed-choice model for general decision making
MISC	the model departs from utility theory and prospect theory in its treatment of multiple goals and it suggests several different ways in which context can affect choice
MISC	it is particularly instructive to apply this model to protective decisions  which are often puzzling
MISC	among other anomalies  people insure against non-catastrophic events  underinsure against catastrophic risks  and allow extraneous factors to influence insurance purchases and other protective decisions
OWNX	neither expected-utility theory nor prospect theory can explain these anomalies satisfactorily
MISC	a concept of goal or aim  motive  purpose  etc
MISC	has been long been taken for granted in many accounts of human behavior
MISC	behavior is attributed to aims or goals in everyday discourse  he wore his best suit in order to make a good first impression   in literature epics  novels  etc
MISC	  william james's principles of psychology  citation   and kurt lewin's dynamic theory of personality  citation
MISC	despite the obviousness and wide use of goal concepts  the dominant tradition in economics and the decision sciences has emphasized utility or value as a basis for choice
MISC	particular goals are viewed as ways of increasing utility or happiness
MISC	the view that all goals contribute to a single common currency was clearly enunciated by plato  in the symposium
MISC	this view is central to plato's thought  underlying his theories of education and government
MISC	studies in mathematics  science  and metaphysics are needed to educate the  skillful weigher   who must integrate across different goals and across near and distant times
MISC	similar views dominated utilitarian thought in the  number th to  number th centuries  and included integration of value across individuals in a society as well as different goals and times e g
MISC	aristotle's ethics  by contrast  partially disagreed  emphasizing multiple goods  and stating that the way in which different goals fit together should vary with the occasion
MISC	despite this hint from aristotle  plato's concept of a single common currency that serves to integrate value across myriad goals has largely held sway both in general psychology and in decision science
MISC	freud's concept of libido  citation   beebe-center's hedonic tone  citation   hull's concept of generalized drive  citation   work on reward systems in the brain  citation   and diener's and seligman's concepts of general happiness  citation  all suggest some general quality that is linked to many different goals
MISC	in decision science  the concept of maximization is linked closely to a mapping onto a single dimension of utility
MISC	a bounded set of real numbers has a limiting maximum  but there is no natural total ordering of sets of vectors in two or more dimensions  and therefore no natural concept of maximization
MISC	in fact  total ordering is fundamental to most foundational theories in decision science  citation
MISC	the idea that all human goods can be weighed in the same balance is a fascinating scientific hypothesis that has been worth pursuing  to determine the extent of its applicability and the ways in which it fails
MISC	translating many goods into a one-dimensional currency fits well with human thought processes  especially analog mental models  citation
MISC	unidimensionality opens the way to the application of powerful mathematical methods for computing or for approximating maxima  citation
AIMX	in this paper  we pursue a more aristotelian theory of decision making  where preferences are constructed based on the decision context  citation   and a decision maker focuses on goals  rather than on maximizing happiness or utility
OWNX	as our title implies  the theory we present is about goals and plans
MISC	a shopping trip is paradigmatic  because it often involves several discrete stops  each with one or more goals  but an evening at a movie may simultaneously satisfy the goals of companionship  emotional and visual stimulation  and keeping up with current culture
MISC	insurance plans are often aimed both at financial goals and at emotional goals  peace of mind 
OWNX	we will discuss multiple goals of insurance and other protective plans in detail below
OWNX	we do not consider each tiny muscle movement or each phoneme in an utterance to be a choice
MISC	rather  decision theory offers explanations only at the behavioral level where someone consciously or unconsciously considers what goals will be accomplished by various possible plans  or what plan can be designed that will be likely to achieve several important goals
MISC	past research on plans can be unearthed from various areas of cognitive science
MISC	the area of motor control is particularly rich in evidence for unconscious higher-level programs governing sequences of skilled movements  citation
MISC	interest in movement planning is very explicit in robotics  citation
MISC	planning has sporadically been considered in other theories of human and or artificial intelligence
MISC	one of the major virtues of considering goals and plans together is that individual decision making is brought into close analogy with organizational decision making
MISC	for a new railroad bridge  or for an advertising campaign  the goals  the plans  and their perceived relationship are made explicit and often recorded
MISC	for an individual decision  goals  plans  and their perceived relationship are hidden within that person's conscious and unconscious cognitions and emotions  but one can try nonetheless to gather data that provide some information about these processes
MISC	this stance also requires us to distinguish between goals and resources
MISC	some resources  such as money or favors owed  can be accumulated  sometimes  accumulation of a resource may itself become a goal
MISC	we nonetheless continue to distinguish  for example  between money considered as a resource and the same money considered as a goal
OWNX	a main concern of our paper is protective decision making
OWNX	in much of it  the focus is even narrower  we consider insurance decisions at length
OWNX	the theory we offer is much more broadly applicable
MISC	there are many apparent anomalies in insurance decisions by individuals and households
MISC	applying a multiple-goal theory in this domain has been both challenging and enlightening  compared to the more obvious examples such as shopping trips and movie excursions
OWNX	in discussing insurance choices  we start from the idea that insurance is designed principally as a device to share financial risk  for situations where many are at risk  but relatively few actually suffer a financial loss
MISC	in many cases  it is easy to share financial risk  but difficult  if not impossible  to share other risks
MISC	having one's home burn down  for example  is extremely stressful  even if nobody is hurt
MISC	the stress may persist for a considerable period of time
MISC	stress-induced suffering cannot readily be shared by others not directly affected by the fire  although social practices exist that can ease it
MISC	what can most easily be shared is the financial risk
MISC	each household at risk pays a relatively small amount  the insurance premium  to participate in this risk sharing
MISC	when a participant's home does burn down  the insurer pays the contracted amount to cover some of the cost of rebuilding or purchasing a replacement home
MISC	instead of a few cases where victims suffer catastrophic financial loss  everyone at risk bears a much smaller financial payment
MISC	insurance premiums must be large enough in aggregate to cover not only the total insured financial losses  but also the costs to the insurer of the risk-sharing effort
MISC	thus  premiums unless subsidized usually exceed average losses
MISC	in common-sense terms  and in standard economic theory  people are willing to pay more than the expected loss because they are risk-averse
MISC	paying the premium does not lower overall utility or happiness level significantly  but suffering a large financial loss would result in a very large drop in utility or happiness
MISC	this ratio of utility changes is much greater than the inverse probability of incurring the loss  thus suggesting that individuals purchase insurance so as to maximize their expected utility
MISC	from a financial standpoint  anomalies arise when consumer choices with respect to insurance sometimes appear to be suboptimal given reasonable degrees of risk aversion
MISC	for example  it is common for people to pay added premiums that seem excessive to obtain automobile collision insurance with a low rather than high deductible that requires them to pay for the initial portion of the loss
MISC	to make matters worse  some decide not to file a claim following a small accident whose cost could largely be reimbursed via this low deductible  they fear that a claim would lead to increased premiums in the next and succeeding years and or they prefer to avoid incurring the transaction costs involved in settling the claim with their insurer
MISC	a higher deductible would have saved these individuals money before the accident and avoided the costs associated with deciding whether or not to file a claim
MISC	a rather different example emerged after the passage of the national flood insurance program nfip in  number 
MISC	yet there was limited interest in purchasing this coverage despite the subsidy and despite the potential for catastrophic losses  citation
MISC	if such a possession is needed  then it must be replaced after loss or damage
MISC	the replacement cost remains the same  independent of one's positive or negative feelings toward the object
OWNX	since the insurance offers exactly the claims payment  it is hard to justify financially paying more for insuring the attractive than the less attractive object
OWNX	we next section  number  discuss the types of insurance anomaly illustrated by the preceding three examples  and suggest psychological processes related to goals that might account for each type
OWNX	section  number  presents the elements of a quantitative theory of constructed choice  based on goals  plans  and decision weights  and contrasts this theory with the standard theory of expected utility maximization
OWNX	section  number  presents a taxonomy of insurance-related goals
OWNX	section  number  draws on this taxonomy to explain the insurance anomalies in terms of our constructed-choice theory
OWNX	this section also probes the failings of utility theory and prospect theory with respect to characterizing insurance decisions
OWNX	the paper concludes section  number  with a set of prescriptive implications concerning protective activities  based on our theory of decision making
MISC	people report themselves to be above average on simple tasks and below average on difficult tasks
MISC	the new explanation is that people conflate relative with absolute evaluation  especially on subjective measures
MISC	the results suggest that conflation occurs at the response stage during which people attempt to disambiguate subjective response scales in order to choose an answer
MISC	this is because conflation has little effect on objective measures  which would be equally affected if the conflation occurred at encoding
MISC	there is an inconsistency in research findings on comparative judgment
MISC	both better-than-average bta and worse-than-average wta effects tend to be stronger in direct measures than in indirect measures of comparative judgment
MISC	given the robustness  durability  and profound consequences of biases in comparative judgment  citation   this inconsistency deserves investigation
MISC	direct measures of comparison ask people to explicitly compare two thingsusually comparing themselves with others
MISC	for instance  moore and kim  citation  had their participants take a  number -item trivia quiz that was either very easy mean score    number  percent  correct or very difficult mean score    number  percent  correct
MISC	a direct comparative measure asked  how do you expect to score relative to others
MISC	  and participants responded on a scale ranging from  number  well below average to  number  well above average
MISC	those who took the easy quiz expected that they would score above average  while takers of the difficult quiz expected to score below average
MISC	indirect measures ask people to evaluate the target and the referent to which the target is being compared separately using the same absolute standard
MISC	for instance  moore and kim  citation  also asked their participants to estimate their own and others' scores on the trivia quiz
MISC	the indirect measure of comparison is calculated by subtracting estimated performance for self minus others
MISC	those who had taken the easy quiz guessed that their own scores would be higher than those of others  whereas those who had taken the difficult quiz guessed that their own scores would be lower
MISC	the curious fact is that both bta and wta effects are stronger in direct measures of comparison than in indirect measures of comparison  citation
MISC	in other words  task difficulty has a bigger effect on indirect than on direct comparative evaluations
MISC	moore and kim's manipulation of task difficulty had significantly larger effect on the direct measure than had on the indirect measure
MISC	to be precise  moore and kim's  citation  manipulation of task difficulty accounted for  number  percent  of the variance in direct measure
MISC	by contrast  the difficulty manipulation accounted for only  number  percent  of the variance in the indirect measure
MISC	the most popular explanation for this difference is differential weighting
MISC	the differential weighting explanation holds that people weight the target and the referent differently when making comparative judgments
MISC	that is  the self or the target of comparison is weighed more heavily than is the other or the referent
MISC	the referent may be neglected for several reasons  including the fact that information about the self is generally more accessible  more vivid  or more reliable than information about others kruger  windschitl  burrus  fessel   and  chambers  in press
MISC	this theory holds that stronger bta effects on easy tasks and wta effects on hard tasks on direct than on indirect judgments has deep psychological origins
MISC	it is the result of differences in the accessibility  salience  or reliability of knowledge of the target and referent  and is not simply the result of the response scale used to elicit people's beliefs
MISC	a number of studies have presented the results of path analyses  citation
MISC	these analyses utilize three variables   number  absolute evaluation of a target individual   number  absolute evaluation of the referent group or a representative member of the group  and  number  a direct comparative judgment of the individual relative to the group
MISC	figure  number  shows a path analysis using moore and kim's  citation  data
MISC	direct comparative judgments ought to weight the target and the referent equally and oppositely  but the target appears to be weighted more heavily   number  than is the referent number 
MISC	differential weighting may be an accurate description of the results of the path analyses
MISC	however  it is not necessarily an accurate description of the underlying psychological processes in comparative judgment
MISC	an important flaw in these path analyses suggests that the result may not be diagnostic of actual differential weighting by the person making the comparison
MISC	if people are making comparisons sensibly then there should be less variance in estimates of the group average than in estimates of individual performance
MISC	after all  if everyone correctly estimated the group average  then there should be no between-person variance in estimates of the group average and it would therefore be non-predictive of comparative judgments in path analyses
MISC	but there is an additional concern regarding the way in which path analyses are often conducted  absolute judgments of target and referent are often measured on subjective verbally-anchored scales
MISC	biernat's work on shifting standards has demonstrated that responses on such scales are sensitive to the relevant comparison group  citation
MISC	an american woman who measures  number  feet  number  inches would be more likely to describe herself as tall than would a man of the same height
MISC	ratings on subjective response scales are unlikely to be pure measures of either absolute or relative assessment  citation
MISC	measures intended to tap absolute performance will  at least in part  be measures of relative performance as well
MISC	imagine a simple test on which everyone does well
MISC	if one person received a score of  number  percent  and the other  number  test-takers all scored above  number  percent   when asked   how well did you do on the test
MISC	  the person who got  number  percent  is unlikely to rate himself an  number  on a  number -point scale if that scale is anchored with verbal labels such as  very poorly  and  very well
MISC	it should be no surprise that the target's rated absolute performance correlates highly with relative performance when they are both measured on subjective response scales
MISC	to some extent  they are measuring the same thing
MISC	this brings us to the second explanation for why bta and wta effects are stronger in direct than in indirect measures of comparative judgment  conflation
MISC	conflation is the error of treating two distinct concepts as if they were one
MISC	people routinely conflate absolute and relative evaluation with each other when making comparative judgments  citation
MISC	that is  when people are asked to compare themselves with others  their comparative judgments are contaminated by their absolute judgments of their own performances  citation
MISC	subjectively anchored response scales force participants to construe the scale in order to map their own private knowledge onto the response scale
MISC	idiosyncratic construals open these subjective scales to influence or contamination by other considerations  citation
MISC	after having done well at a task  people are more likely to rate themselves as being above average  even if it is a simple task on which everyone should be expected to do well
MISC	the new part of this explanation is the idea that the way comparative judgment is measured matters
MISC	the implication would be that people can make more accurate estimates of comparative judgment  but that experimenters often fail to ask the question in ways most likely to elicit an uncontaminated comparative judgment
MISC	this is not an obscure technical issue of measurementit is important for two reasons
MISC	first  subjective verbally-anchored scales are perhaps the single most commonly used measure in psychological research  including work on comparative judgment
MISC	if such measures elicit systematically biased responses  the implications may be profound with respect to both the reinterpretation of prior findings and the optimal design of future studies
MISC	second  it would illuminate the psychological processes at work in comparative judgment
MISC	if people can make accurate comparative judgments when provided with unambiguous response scales it shows that conflation is occurring at the response stage during which people's mental representations are translated into behavioral responses
MISC	if  instead  the conflation of relative and absolute evaluation were occurring during encoding  then it would appear in people's responses to all sorts of comparative judgments  regardless of the response format of the question  because there would be no unconflated evaluation to retrieve
MISC	without a doubt  bta and wta effects are multiply determined
OWNX	it is not the goal of this paper to show that conflation is the only cause of these effects  only that conflation is a contributing cause and distinct from other causes
MISC	this simple demonstration has important repercussions
MISC	it suggests that prior research has often overestimated the size of both bta and wta effects through the use of vague measures
MISC	the four experiments presented here examine the conflation explanation by testing its specific predictions and by eliminating as many other explanations for bta and wta effects as possible
MISC	i use both subjective response scales and also clearer objective measures
MISC	i find that bta effects on easy tasks and wta effects on difficult tasks weaken with more objective measures
MISC	experiment  number  replicates the bta and wta effects shown elsewhere  and seeks to eradicate them through experimental manipulations that provide participants with clear and unambiguous information about the performances of themselves and others
MISC	finally  research has shown that bta and wta effects are stronger when the referent is a group rather than an individual  citation
MISC	the fact that the effect persists  even in this context  but only on subjective direct measures  is explained better by conflation than by other theories
MISC	first  the four studies i report are the first to put the conflation explanation for bta and wta effects to the test by systematically comparing judgments varying in their subjectivity
MISC	second  the four studies presented here do another thing that prior research has not  present participants with excellent information about performance by target and referent
MISC	this is important for ruling out other explanations for bta and wta effects
MISC	third  experiments  number    number   and  number  take tests of the conflation explanation to their logical extreme by minimizing egocentric motives and having people compare two targets about which they have complete information
MISC	theoretical equivalence exists among various auction mechanisms  specifically the second-price-auction spa  a competitive environment  and the bdm mechanism  a non-competitive environment
MISC	yet  empirical studies suggest that behavior in these mechanisms may diverge
OWNX	our experimental study examines the wtp and the wta of individuals by analyzing buying and selling bidding patterns both for a physical product mugs and for two types of lotteries regular lotteries and extreme lotteries in these two auctions mechanism  spa and bdm
OWNX	we found that the wtp in the spa is higher than the wtp in the bdm for mugs and for regular lotteries  while the mechanisms do not differ significantly for extreme lotteries
MISC	in addition  the wta in the spa is lower than in the bdm for regular lotteries only
MISC	these results indicate that the wtp and wta  as well as the wta-wtp gap  tend to differ in the spa and in the bdm as a result of the interaction between the competitiveness effect and other psychological effects on bidding patterns for riskless and risky assets
MISC	in addition  the current study suggests that the competitiveness effect depends not only on the type of mechanism spa  but also on the type of item physical assets or lotteries and the type of lottery
MISC	in addition  the influence of the competitiveness effect may vary between buying and selling positions
MISC	several studies have compared the bidding patterns of subjects in different auction mechanisms
MISC	despite the theoretical equivalence among various auction mechanisms  such as the bdm mechanism  citation  and the second-price-auction henceforth  spa  citation   empirical studies suggest that behavior in these mechanisms may diverge  citation
MISC	in auctions based on the bdm mechanism  individuals buying an asset declare their maximum buying price  known as willingness-to-pay wtp
MISC	if the bidding price is higher than a drawn number  the individual pays the drawn number and buys the asset
MISC	when selling an asset  individuals declare their minimum selling price  known as willingness-to-accept wta
MISC	if the bidding price is lower than a drawn number  the individual receives the amount of the drawn number and sells the asset
MISC	the spa is more competitive than the bdm mechanism  since each participant competes with others
MISC	shogren et al citation  suggested that in the spa   people may submit bids to win for the sake of winning
MISC	they may bid wtp-up and wta-down in order to walk out of the experiment as the 'top-dog' among their peers  p  number 
MISC	the top-dog effect is said to exist if bidders submit bids in excess of their true valuation with the intention of deriving utility by winning the auction
MISC	previous evidence on the existence of a top-dog effect has been mixed
MISC	shogren and hayes  citation  report that nearly  number  percent  of participants in an induced-value auction market submitted bids that were less than or equal to their assigned value
MISC	the authors concluded that these results are not consistent with the existence of a top-dog effect
MISC	in contrast  kagel's review  citation  of the induced-value spa literature indicates that the mean bid in such auctions is generally greater than predicted by theory
MISC	in addition  shavit et al citation  show that competitiveness affects bidding patterns in the spa
MISC	the current study examines the impact of the top-dog effect  or the competitiveness effect  in the spa on bidding patterns for different goods riskless and risky assets and in different positions buyer or seller
MISC	in particular  the study examined the wtp and the wta by analyzing buying and selling bidding patterns both for mugs and for lotteries in two separate auctions mechanism  the spa  a competitive environment  and the bdm mechanism  a non-competitive environment
OWNX	we consider two types of lotteries  regular lotteries and extreme lotteries
MISC	previous studies did not distinguish between biddings on regular and extreme lotteries for the two mechanisms
OWNX	for extreme lotteries  we expect no impact of the competitiveness effect in the buying position of the spa  since the chances for loss are very high and such a lottery will not be attractive to buy
MISC	the effects are the impact of each of these effects  and the sum of all of them  on the wtp and the wta is expected to vary among goods and mechanisms
MISC	the literature does not discuss the possible interaction between these psychological effects and the competitiveness environment effect
OWNX	our study fills this void and compares the interaction of these effects on bidding for mugs and for lotteries
MISC	psychological effects  such as loss aversion and the endowment effect  have been used to explain the wta-wtp disparity  citation
MISC	yet  recent studies have questioned the existence and interpretation of a possible gap between wtp and wta  citation
MISC	shogren and hayes  citation  and shogern et al citation  argued that the wta-wtp disparity in the first trial for market goods candy bars and university mugs in both auctions bdm and spa disappeared quickly for repeated trials in the spa  though it persisted in the bdm mechanism
MISC	shogern et al citation  suggested that the wta-wtp disparity may depend on the auction mechanism
MISC	for lotteries  schmidt and traub  citation  argued that an asymmetric effect  in which the buyer focuses on the potential disappointment of the lowest outcome and the seller focuses on the potential regret of losing the highest outcome  may cause the disparity between wta and wtp
MISC	in sum  the current study examines the wta and wtp for riskless goods mugs and two types of risky assets regular and extreme lotteries in competitive versus non-competitive mechanisms and compares the wta-wtp gap for these items in the two mechanisms
MISC	the study also discusses the influence of the interaction between the competitive effect and other psychological effects on subjects' bidding patterns
MISC	the results should shed some light on the impact of the competitiveness effect in the spa on the bidding pattern for different assets and different positions  in comparison to the bdm
OWNX	section  number  outlines the main hypotheses  section  number  presents the experimental method  and section  number  presents the results
OWNX	we compare and critique two measures of risk perception
MISC	  - captures the concept of risk perception more accurately than the multiple-item measure used by sitkin and weingart  citation
OWNX	we further propose that the error underlying the construction of sitkin and weingart's measure is explained in terms of a top-down model of risk perception  in which perceived risk and perceived return are consequences  rather than determinants  of attractiveness
MISC	two studies compare the validity of the two alternative measures
MISC	the concepts of risk  return and attractiveness are distinct concepts in the theory of decision making
MISC	therefore  the empirical measurement of perceived risk should apply special care to avoid its contamination with perceived return and global evaluation attractiveness  and to guard against inadvertent replacing of one kind of meaning with another
MISC	according to siegrist  earle and gutscher's  citation  model of risk communication  the effect of advice about risk on an agent's behavior depends on the agent's trust in the competence of the advisor and on their trust in the motives of the advisor
MISC	trust in competence depends on how good the advice received from the source has been in the past
MISC	trust in motives depends on how similar the agent assesses the advisor's values to be to their own
MISC	these findings support siegrist et al 's model
OWNX	we also found that revealed trust was affected more than stated trust by differences in advisor quality
MISC	it is not clear how this finding should be accommodated within siegrist et al 's  citation  model
MISC	throughout the social sciences  trust is recognized as an important factor that mediates many aspects of human behavior  citation
MISC	definitions of trust vary but a widely accepted one is that it is  a psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based upon positive expectations of the intentions or behavior of another   citation
MISC	thus  a person the trustor who depends on someone else the trustee expects to reduce the likelihood or size of a negative outcome in some situation  when that dependence is misplaced  the expected value of the outcome is lower
MISC	experimental work on trust has been carried out in various contexts  including behavioral game theory  citation   on-line commerce  citation   and risk communication
MISC	reliance on advisors signals an acceptance of vulnerability based on expectations that those advisors are competent and well-meaning when  in fact  they may not be
MISC	such reliance provides evidence of trust in the sense encapsulated by the above definition
MISC	recent research into trust indicates that it is determined by a number of factors  citation
MISC	these factors can be broadly categorized into two groups
MISC	on the basis of findings such as these  siegrist  earle and gutscher  citation  and siegrist  gutscher and earle  citation  developed their trust-confidence-cooperation tcc model
MISC	a simplified version of it is shown in figure  number 
MISC	according to this model  two different types of trust determine the degree to which people cooperate with their advisors
MISC	the first is trust in motives also known simply as  trust  or  social trust  and the second is trust in competence known as  confidence 
MISC	the cooperative intention produced by these two types of trust results in cooperative behaviors of various types
MISC	for example  people may express trust in their advisors  they may use advice from them to form their own judgments  or they may act on the basis of their advice
MISC	trust in competence is determined by past history of the quality of advice produced by the source
MISC	this type of information has already been shown to affect advice-taking  people place greater weight on information received from sources who have been more accurate in the past  citation
MISC	trust in motives is determined by how similar the judge assesses the advisor's values to be to their own
MISC	siegrist et al 's  citation  model predicts that people will take more advice from advisors whose values they judge to be more similar to their own
MISC	to date  this prediction of their two-route model has not been tested
OWNX	our aim here is to provide such a test
MISC	in the past  researchers into advice-taking have measured trust in advice by using behavioral measures
MISC	for example  given two different pieces of advice for the value of a numerical variable e g   a risk level  a judgment closer to the first than to the second indicates greater influence of the first
MISC	hence  relative proximity of judgments to advice from different sources provides a behavioral means of assessing the relative influence of those sources of advice
MISC	in contrast  researchers into trust have required people to make verbal or numerical estimates of their trust in different sources of information - typically by using rating scales
MISC	however  o'neill  citation  has argued that behavioral and verbal measures of trust may not always coincide
MISC	for example  people may state that they do not trust an agent when their behavior reveals that they do
MISC	indeed  there is some evidence that stated and revealed trust do dissociate under certain conditions  citation
MISC	siegrist et al 's  citation  model predicts that similarity of values  intentions and goals will increase trust in motives and thereby increase the influence of an advisor on a judge
MISC	however  it does not make any prediction about the effects of physical similarity of the advisor and the judge
MISC	nevertheless there is good reason to expect that people will be more influenced by advisors who are the same sex as they are or who are approximately the same age as they are
MISC	this is because there is persuasive evidence that attitudes and values  particularly those relating to risk and technology  are more likely to be similar in people of the same sex and similar age  citation
MISC	as a result  physical i e   age  sex similarity may imply a degree of value similarity
MISC	if it does  advisors who are physically similar to judges are likely to be trusted more
MISC	also advisors who are similar to judges in both respects are likely to be trusted more than those who are similar to them in just one respect
MISC	in the hybrid ecology  the relationships among correspondence and coherence strategies and goals and cognitive tactics on the continuum from intuition to analysis become critically important
MISC	intuitive tactics used to achieve correspondence in the physical world do not work in the electronic world
MISC	in correspondence-driven domains  judgments - how far away and how high is that obstacle
MISC	what is the correct diagnosis given these symptoms
MISC	where is the enemy force likely to attack
OWNX	- are guided by multiple probabilistic and fallible indicators in the physical world
OWNX	survival depends on the correspondence or accuracy of our judgment  that is  how well it corresponds to objective reality
MISC	the increasing availability of sophisticated technological systems  however  has profoundly altered the character of many correspondence-driven environments  such as aviation  medicine  military operations  or nuclear power  as well as the processes of judgments and decision making within them
MISC	as technology has changed the nature of cues and information available to the pilot  it has also changed the strategies and tactics pilots must use to make judgments successfully
MISC	the recognition of these changes carries implications for research models in high-technology environments  as well as for the design of systems and decision aids
MISC	patients suffering from the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia ftd-b often exaggerate their abilities
MISC	are those errors in judgment limited to domains in which patients under-perform  or do ftd-b patients overestimate their abilities in other domains
MISC	is overconfidence in ftd-b patients domain-specific or domain-general
MISC	in both domains  ftd-b patients overestimated their performance relative to patients with dementia of alzheimer type dat and healthy elderly subjects
MISC	results are consistent with a domain-general deficit in metacognitive judgment
OWNX	we discuss these findings in relation to  regression to the mean  accounts of overconfidence and the role of emotions in metacognitive judgments
MISC	how good are you at multitasking
MISC	how good are you at remembering people's names
MISC	judgments people make about their own cognitive abilities vary greatly from one person to another
MISC	these judgments about the self are also systematically biased relative to the judgments made by others about us citation
MISC	discouraging as these observations might be  people can learn and improve at most cognitive tasks
MISC	these examples illustrate several aspects of what is known in the cognitive and developmental literatures as metacognition or the knowledge people possess about their own cognitive abilities  including beliefs about their own performance in specific tasks
MISC	some psychologists have argued that metacognitive judgment is secondary to actual performance citation
MISC	according to this view  the knowledge and skills required to perform tasks in a certain domain are also required for judging one's ability in that domain
MISC	one corollary of this view is that metacognitive judgment is domain-specific  a person who is good at remembering things and bad at understanding how others feel will be relatively aware of his good memory skills but relatively unaware of his poor empathy skills
MISC	despite its intuitive appeal  this view has been challenged as confounding metacognitive judgment with level of performance
MISC	because subjective estimates of performance are never perfectly correlated with actual performance  judgments of performance will regress toward the mean  participants who perform worst in a given domain will tend to overestimate their ability in that domain  while those performing best will tend to underestimate
MISC	in other words  the relation between actual performance and subjective judgment may reflect a statistical artifact rather than a genuine relation between cognitive and meta-cognitive levels citation
MISC	although biased beliefs about one's own skills are the norm  such biases are often exacerbated in psychiatric and neurological disorders citation
MISC	denial of deficit  reduced self-awareness  loss of insight  and anosognosia are all clinical terms that broadly refer to the same phenomenon  a patient's distorted assessment of her own skills
MISC	these patient populations provide an excellent opportunity to test the domain-specificity of metacognitive judgment  as certain abilities become severely affected by the disease while others remain relatively unaffected
MISC	thus  it is possible to ask whether metacognitive judgments become distorted only in the affected domains or the distortion generalizes to judgments in spared domains
MISC	the answer to this question so far has been mixed
MISC	consistent with the domain-specificity hypothesis  some studies have reported cases of patients with hemiplegia who deny their paralysis but acknowledge limitations in other domains citation
MISC	there is also evidence that failures of awareness cluster around symptoms
MISC	for example  in a study of denial in dementia of alzheimer's type dat  a factor analysis of questionnaire data revealed two independent factors  a  cognitive denial  related to length of disease and severity of cognitive deficits  and a  behavioral denial  related to behavioral disinhibition and inappropriate emotional displays citation
MISC	in contrast  other studies have reported findings consistent with a domain-general deficit  showing that metacognitive errors extend beyond the specific domain of impairment
MISC	for example  patients with probable dat have been reported to overestimate their performance not only in memory but also in visuo-spatial tasks citation
MISC	furthermore  denial in dat seems to correlate more strongly with frontal lobe deficit than with memory problems  despite the latter being more typical of dat citation
MISC	although denial of deficit is prevalent in the clinical setting and may help us understand over-optimism in healthy adults  until not long ago research on denial of deficit had proceeded independently from the experimentally based literature on metacognitive judgment
MISC	recently  the clinical and experimental traditions have become better integrated and clinical researchers have begun to rely more heavily on experimental paradigms citation
MISC	such experimental designs are useful for comparing patients' judgments of their performance to their actual performance on the task
MISC	furthermore  by asking the patient to predict performance before the task and to estimate it after the task  it is possible to assess metacognitive monitoring i e   whether metacognitive judgment improves after experiencing the task
MISC	experimental designs can be applied to domains other than the one of primary clinical concern
OWNX	the patient populations in our study consisted of patients with a behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia ftd-b and patients with early dementia of alzheimer type dat
MISC	although ftd-b has an insidious onset and a gradual progression  its clinical presentation bears close resemblance to cases of orbitofrontal damage caused by traumatic brain injury  such as the famous case of phineas gage citation
MISC	they often exhibit inappropriate social behavior  changes in personality and poor decision making citation
MISC	at early stages of the disease  many ftd-b patients deny having difficulties or seem unconcerned about them citation
MISC	such a denial has been documented in the social and emotional domains but needs to be explored further in domains of relatively spared performance
MISC	in contrast to ftd-b  patients in early stages of dat have their social skills relatively spared
MISC	the deficit in dat is primarily of episodic memory citation
MISC	at early stages  dat patients tend to be aware of their deficit  but this awareness declines as the disease progresses citation
OWNX	after describing ftd-b's denial of deficit in semi-structured interviews  we report two experiments that examined whether ftd-b patients overestimate their performance relative to dat patients and healthy adults
OWNX	by testing metacognition in two different domains attention  perception  neither of which is prototypically impaired in early dementia  we were able to test the domain-generality of metacognitive judgments
MISC	patients suffering from the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia ftd-b often exaggerate their abilities
MISC	are those errors in judgment limited to domains in which patients under-perform  or do ftd-b patients overestimate their abilities in other domains
MISC	is overconfidence in ftd-b patients domain-specific or domain-general
MISC	in both domains  ftd-b patients overestimated their performance relative to patients with dementia of alzheimer type dat and healthy elderly subjects
MISC	results are consistent with a domain-general deficit in metacognitive judgment
OWNX	we discuss these findings in relation to  regression to the mean  accounts of overconfidence and the role of emotions in metacognitive judgments
MISC	how good are you at multitasking
MISC	how good are you at remembering people's names
MISC	judgments people make about their own cognitive abilities vary greatly from one person to another
MISC	these judgments about the self are also systematically biased relative to the judgments made by others about us  citation
MISC	discouraging as these observations might be  people can learn and improve at most cognitive tasks
MISC	these examples illustrate several aspects of what is known in the cognitive and developmental literatures as metacognition or the knowledge people possess about their own cognitive abilities  including beliefs about their own performance in specific tasks
MISC	some psychologists have argued that metacognitive judgment is secondary to actual performance  citation
MISC	according to this view  the knowledge and skills required to perform tasks in a certain domain are also required for judging one's ability in that domain
MISC	one corollary of this view is that metacognitive judgment is domain-specific  a person who is good at remembering things and bad at understanding how others feel will be relatively aware of his good memory skills but relatively unaware of his poor empathy skills
MISC	despite its intuitive appeal  this view has been challenged as confounding metacognitive judgment with level of performance
MISC	because subjective estimates of performance are never perfectly correlated with actual performance  judgments of performance will regress toward the mean  participants who perform worst in a given domain will tend to overestimate their ability in that domain  while those performing best will tend to underestimate
MISC	in other words  the relation between actual performance and subjective judgment may reflect a statistical artifact rather than a genuine relation between cognitive and meta-cognitive levels  citation
MISC	although biased beliefs about one's own skills are the norm  such biases are often exacerbated in psychiatric and neurological disorders  citation
MISC	denial of deficit  reduced self-awareness  loss of insight  and anosognosia are all clinical terms that broadly refer to the same phenomenon  a patient's distorted assessment of her own skills
MISC	these patient populations provide an excellent opportunity to test the domain-specificity of metacognitive judgment  as certain abilities become severely affected by the disease while others remain relatively unaffected
MISC	thus  it is possible to ask whether metacognitive judgments become distorted only in the affected domains or the distortion generalizes to judgments in spared domains
MISC	the answer to this question so far has been mixed
MISC	consistent with the domain-specificity hypothesis  some studies have reported cases of patients with hemiplegia who deny their paralysis but acknowledge limitations in other domains  citation
MISC	there is also evidence that failures of awareness cluster around symptoms
MISC	for example  in a study of denial in dementia of alzheimer's type dat  a factor analysis of questionnaire data revealed two independent factors  a  cognitive denial  related to length of disease and severity of cognitive deficits  and a  behavioral denial  related to behavioral disinhibition and inappropriate emotional displays  citation
MISC	in contrast  other studies have reported findings consistent with a domain-general deficit  showing that metacognitive errors extend beyond the specific domain of impairment
MISC	for example  patients with probable dat have been reported to overestimate their performance not only in memory but also in visuo-spatial tasks  citation
MISC	furthermore  denial in dat seems to correlate more strongly with frontal lobe deficit than with memory problems  despite the latter being more typical of dat  citation
MISC	although denial of deficit is prevalent in the clinical setting and may help us understand over-optimism in healthy adults  until not long ago research on denial of deficit had proceeded independently from the experimentally based literature on metacognitive judgment
MISC	recently  the clinical and experimental traditions have become better integrated and clinical researchers have begun to rely more heavily on experimental paradigms  citation
MISC	such experimental designs are useful for comparing patients' judgments of their performance to their actual performance on the task
MISC	furthermore  by asking the patient to predict performance before the task and to estimate it after the task  it is possible to assess metacognitive monitoring i e   whether metacognitive judgment improves after experiencing the task
MISC	experimental designs can be applied to domains other than the one of primary clinical concern
OWNX	the patient populations in our study consisted of patients with a behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia ftd-b and patients with early dementia of alzheimer type dat
MISC	although ftd-b has an insidious onset and a gradual progression  its clinical presentation bears close resemblance to cases of orbitofrontal damage caused by traumatic brain injury  such as the famous case of phineas gage  citation
MISC	they often exhibit inappropriate social behavior  changes in personality and poor decision making  citation

MISC	ambiguity aversion has been widely observed in individuals' judgments
OWNX	using scenarios that are typical in decision analysis  we investigate ambiguity aversion for pairs of individuals
OWNX	in our experiment the participants were first asked to specify individually their willingness-to-pay for six monetary gambles
MISC	they were then paired at random into dyads  and were asked to specify their willingness-to-pay amount for the same gambles
MISC	the dyad's willingness-to-pay amount was to be shared equally by the two individuals
OWNX	of the six gambles in our experiment  one involved no ambiguity and the remaining five involved different degrees of ambiguity
MISC	the majority of the dyads exhibited a cautious shift in the face of ambiguity  stating a smaller willingness-to-pay than the two individuals' average
OWNX	our study thus confirms the persistence of ambiguity aversion in a group setting and demonstrates the predominance of cautious shifts for dyads
MISC	much theoretical and experimental research in decision analysis has examined how individuals do and should make choices and set prices they are willing to pay for risky and ambiguous options
MISC	but  not as much focus has been placed on decisions made by groups  though group decisions are common
MISC	in the context of monetary policy  blinder and morgan citation find that groups make better decisions than individuals
MISC	it is therefore natural to examine how decisions under ambiguity differ when made individually versus when these are made by dyads
MISC	many real world decisions are entrusted to groups in the hope that the collective wisdom will prevail
MISC	risk aversion is consistent with rational decision making and has been observed in a variety of settings
MISC	the evidence on ambiguity aversion has been mixed
MISC	raiffa citation argued that a rational decision maker should not be ambiguity averse
MISC	fox and tversky citation found that ambiguity aversion disappears when individuals evaluate a single gamble in a non-comparative setting  and chow and sarin citation found that ambiguity aversion is reduced when making separate evaluations
MISC	sarin and weber citation found that  in market settings  ambiguity aversion is reduced in independent auctions but not in simultaneous auctions
OWNX	we have at least two reasons to expect less ambiguity aversion and thus higher prices in dyads
OWNX	because our subjects know  in our scenarios  that they can choose either side of the bet  a discussion between two subjects may lead to a realization that the probability of winning is at least  number   number 
MISC	second  individual blame or regret should be moderated in a group setting
MISC	some studies test the significance of regression coefficients in order to decide whether or not specific cues are attended to by the judge or decision maker
MISC	this practice is dubious because it ignores type ii error
MISC	the purposes of this note are  number  to draw attention to this issue  specifically as it appears in studies of self-insight   number  to illustrate the problem with examples from the judgment literature  and  number  to provide a simple method for calculating post-hoc power in regression analyses in order to facilitate the reporting of type ii errors when regression models are used
MISC	for decades judgment analysts have successfully used multiple regression to model the organizing cognitive principles underlying many types of judgments in a variety of contexts  citation
MISC	most often these models depict the individual judge or decision maker as combining multiple differentially weighted pieces of information cues in a compensatory manner to arrive at a judgment
MISC	further  these analyses portray those who have acquired expertise on a judgment task as applying their judgment model or  policy  with regular  although less than perfect  consistency
MISC	the ability of linear regression models to accurately reproduce such expert judgments under various conditions has been discussed in detail  citation
MISC	if one accepts the proposition that people's judgments can be modeled as though they are multiple regression equations  questions arise such as   number  how many of the available cues does the individual use
MISC	and  number  how should the number of cues used be determined
MISC	too many researchers blindly apply statistical significance tests to inform themin a kind of deterministic mannerwhether judges did or did not attend to specific cues
MISC	if the t-test calculated on a cue's weight is significant  then the cue is counted as being attended to by the judge
MISC	relying on p values in this way is a problem because these values are affected by the number of cues and number of cases presented to the judge during the task and by how well the overall regression equation fits the total set of responses
MISC	second  notation commonly used by judgment analysts when describing regression procedures is introduced
MISC	research endeavors to determine the effectiveness of patient decision aids ptdas have yielded mixed results
MISC	the conflicting evaluations are largely due to the different metrics used to assess the validity of judgments made using ptdas
OWNX	evaluation on coherence criteria involves assessing the degree to which decisions follow the logical implications of internal  possibly subjective  value systems preferences
MISC	coherence can exist absent of correspondence and vice versa
OWNX	furthermore  we suggest that future research evaluating ptdas include both correspondence and coherence criteria
MISC	in  number   kenneth hammond argued that the field of judgment and decision making has taken two distinct paths  describing those two paths as meta-theories used in the evaluation of judgments
MISC	in this framework  judgments are evaluated by the degree to which they are similar to solutions given by logical  mathematical  or statistical theories
MISC	judgments are not compared to an external  true  value  instead judgments are compared to a normative rule  often mathematical in nature
MISC	the conditions under which one strategy is chosen in favor of the other  however  have not been fully explicated
MISC	most liberals chose to use exclusion under conditions of abundance and inclusion under scarcity
MISC	how would you decide
MISC	one possible strategy might be to decide which candidates are  in the running
MISC	  that is  you would select or  include  the patients who you think should be seriously considered for an immediate organ transplant
MISC	the other strategy might be to decide which candidates are  out of the running
MISC	  in other words  you would eliminate or  exclude  those patients who you think should not be seriously considered for an immediate organ transplant
MISC	previous research suggests that if you use an inclusion rather than exclusion strategy you will end up with a smaller consideration set  i e   more candidates will be screened out  citation   and you will expend more effort  citation
MISC	research also suggests that  under certain contexts  decision makers may have a natural preference for one strategy over the other  citation
MISC	in experiment  number   participants weighted a consumer review more heavily when it was written in a clear font than in a less clear font
MISC	in experiment  number   participants placed more weight on information when it was in focus than when it was blurry
MISC	in experiment  number   participants placed more weight on financial information from brokerage firms with easy to pronounce names than those with hard to pronounce names
OWNX	these studies demonstrate that fluency affects cue weighting independent of objective cue validity
MISC	when making judgments and decisions  people have numerous pieces of information i e   cues available to aid in the decision process
MISC	when deciding whether a patient has diabetes  a doctor might examine the patient's symptoms  family health history  or lab results
MISC	a stockbroker might consider companies' profit margins  quarterly projections  and recent activity
MISC	a judge or jurist might consider testimony from several witnesses and various other pieces of evidence
MISC	conventional models suggest that decision-makers should weight information based on objective cue validity
MISC	according to normative principles such as the weighted additive citation   additive difference citation   and weighted averaging models citation   people should consider all of the available cues that might inform a particular judgment
MISC	they should then differentially weight each cue based upon how successfully the cue predicts the outcome
MISC	given that learning cue validities can be time consuming and inaccurate citation   we propose that people might use a cue's fluency  or the ease with which it is processed  as an additional basis for weighting cues
MISC	a fluency-based account of cue weighting does not require decision-makers to know objective cue validities
MISC	instead  this explanation highlights a rather simple tendency  placing more weight on information that feels easy to process
MISC	in addition  common ratio violations in choice behavior are widespread
OWNX	our results provide evidence that probability weighting is a general phenomenon  independent of the source of disutility
MISC	expected utility theory eut is the standard theoretical model of choice under risk used in economic analysis
MISC	eut posits that the utility assigned to a lottery or prospect is linear in the probability of each possible outcome of the lottery
MISC	while eut is an appealing formulation for economic modeling  a number of experiments have called it into question as a descriptive model of choice under risk see starmer  citation  for a review of the literature
MISC	on the other hand  specifications allowing probabilities to be weighted by a function pip  where pip has an inverted s-shape  provide a good empirical fit to the available experimental data  citation
MISC	in recognition of this empirical support  probability weighting is incorporated as a key assumption of several theories of choice under risk  including prospect theory  citation   rank dependent expected utility theory  citation   and cumulative prospect theory  citation
MISC	a particularly striking phenomenon that can arise as a consequence of probability weighting is the common ratio violation
MISC	consider two lotteries and an individual with a utility function ux
MISC	the first yields a payoff of x  not-equals   number  with probability p and a zero payoff with probability  numberp the second lottery yields x  not-equals   number  with probability p and zero otherwise
MISC	the linearity assumption of expected utility theory implies that an individual who chooses the first lottery over the second one must also choose a lottery that delivers x with probability q p over a lottery that yields x with probability q p
MISC	clearly  if pux  is greater than or equal to   pux  then q pux  is greater than or equal to  q pux
MISC	as originally conjectured by allais  citation   common ratio violations which result in indifference curves in the probability triangle explained later that fan out or fan in  have been found to be widespread in the domain of positive payoffs for lotteries involving monetary outcomes  citation
MISC	the empirical support underlying probability weighting and common ratio violations comes primarily from experimental studies in which all outcomes involve non-negative monetary payments  citation
MISC	however  many economic decisions involve the possibility of losses
MISC	examples include a decision to invest in a stock  to choose among alternative medical procedures  or to trust another person or institution in a business or personal transaction
MISC	a few studies have explored decisions in the domain of losses  and they have used one of two techniques to induce negative payoffs
MISC	in some studies  researchers use hypothetical payoffs  examples include kahneman and tversky  citation  and abdellaoui  citation
MISC	in other studies  participants are given a real cash endowment at the beginning of the experiment and real losses are deducted from this initial balance  examples include holt and laury  citation  and mason et al citation
MISC	however  many real life decisions involve negative outcomes that are not monetary
MISC	consider a cancer patient who is asked to make a choice between two uncomfortable medical treatments that involve tradeoffs between probabilities and utilities of different prospective states of health e g   radiation therapy versus extensive surgery
MISC	another example is the decision of a defendant in a criminal case to accept or reject a plea bargain for a reduced sentence in prison
MISC	the defendant faces a choice between lotteries over the time of incarceration
MISC	some authors have used aversive stimuli to investigate other principles of decision making
MISC	for example  ariely et al citation  used annoying sounds as well as having subjects place their fingers inside a tightening vice to study the effects of anchoring on preferences
MISC	coursey et al citation  required individuals to drink sucrose octa-acetate  an unpleasant tasting liquid  to study willingness-to-pay and willingness-to-accept decisions for a  bad   that is  a good with negative value
MISC	pain is a good measure of disutility as almost everyone would rather avoid it
MISC	in addition  as a means of inducing disutility  the use of electric shocks satisfies smith's  citation  precepts pertaining to the appropriateness of a reward medium for an experiment   monotonicity and dominance
MISC	for a fixed duration  the disutility of a shock is monotonic in the current  and therefore it is monotonic in its voltage
OWNX	we find that both probability weighting and common ratio violations are prominent features of our data
OWNX	the median probability weighting parameter we estimate is very similar to those observed in decisions over negative hypothetical monetary payoffs  citation
MISC	the results suggest that a similar process of probability weighting characterizes lottery choice for both monetary and non-monetary outcomes when payoffs are negative
MISC	people live in a world in which they are surrounded by potential disgust elicitors such as  used  chairs  air  silverware  and money as well as excretory activities
MISC	people function in this world by ignoring most of these  by active avoidance  reframing  or adaptation
MISC	the issue is particularly striking for professions  such as morticians  surgeons  or sanitation workers  in which there is frequent contact with major disgust elicitors
MISC	there is a clear reduction in discomfort at touching a cold dead body  but not in touching a human body which is still warm after death
MISC	disgust is  in general  a negative experience which people seek to avoid or terminate  citation
MISC	however  humans live in a disgusting world
MISC	yet  humans negotiate their daily activities without much concern about these disgusting entities
MISC	they do so  in the same way that they are not crippled by thoughts of their mortality  by keeping these concerns in the background  out of consciousness
MISC	this is accomplished in a number of ways   number 
MISC	reframing  that is  thinking of potentially disgusting things in other ways   number 
MISC	adaptation  ceasing to think of many of the potential disgusts as disgusting
MISC	for example  to illustrate denial  most people  when exiting a public bathroom  do not think about the fact that the metal knob or handle on the door that they are opening has been touched by many other unknown people  some of whom no doubt did not wash their hands
MISC	on the other hand  to illustrate adaptation  the mortician who is preparing his hundredth dead body for burial is certainly attending to it  but has ceased  presumably by adaptation  to be disgusted by it
MISC	finally  to illustrate reframing  one can reduce potential disgust about swimming in a public pool in which little children no doubt urinate while swimming  by noting that the ocean itself has a low level of urine in it  so that the swimming pool is just like a smaller instantiation of the ocean
MISC	individuals cope with many potential disgust elicitors encountered in a normal day such that they may experience disgust only a few times in a day
MISC	this problem seems most daunting for individuals whose professions bring them into contact with strong disgust elicitors repeatedly  morticians  sanitation workers  hospital orderlies  and surgeons  for example
MISC	it seems reasonable to suppose two different types of factors are at work in reducing disgust responses in such professions
MISC	first  individuals who are generally less disgust sensitive may be more likely to choose such professions
MISC	second  coping processes of denial  reframing  and adaptation may be presumed to be activated and to become habitual or prepotent
MISC	adaptation seems like the most likely candidate
OWNX	in this study  we explore  number 
MISC	whether adaptation occurs as a result of extensive exposure to a particular class of disgust elicitors  number 
MISC	insofar as adaptation occurs  whether it is specific to the class of elicitors to which there was exposure
MISC	in forecasting and decision making  people can and often do represent a degree of belief in some proposition
MISC	subjects' responses indicated that weight and likelihood were distinguished  that subjects' evidential weight tended toward single elements in a targeted fashion  and  that there were identifiable individual differences in reactions to conflicting evidence
MISC	specifically  most subjects reacted to conflicting evidence that supported disjoint sets of suspects with continued support in the implicated sets  although an identifiable minority reacted by pulling back their support  expressing indecisiveness
MISC	such individuals would likely require a greater amount of evidence than the others to counteract this tendency in support
OWNX	thus  the study identifies the value of understanding evidential weight as distinct from likelihood  informs our understanding of the psychology of individuals' judgments of evidential weight  and furthers the application and meaningfulness of belief functions as a communication language
MISC	probabilities are useful when acting in the absence of complete knowledge  e g   in forecasting or decision making
MISC	such probabilities are interpreted as measures of degrees of likelihood and are assessed against a criterion of truth citation
MISC	scoring rules  as assessments of the quality of probability judgments  operate from this perspective  comparing likelihood assessments to actual outcomes  in an application of the truth criterion citation
MISC	however  from the very origins of probability theory  scholars recognized that truth is not the only criterion of potential interest for interpreting probabilities
MISC	the analysis highlights two separate criteria along which such beliefs may be qualified  truth and justification
MISC	citation
MISC	the distinction is also the basis of a common differentiation between the weight and the balance of evidence that can be traced to keynes citation and which has played a major role in motivating the study of ambiguity in decision-making beginning with ellsberg citation
MISC	if a is true  not-a is false
MISC	to the degree that the evidence favors a  the balance of evidence moves toward a and away from not-a in equal measure
MISC	the weight of evidence is connected with the criterion of justification
MISC	weight depends upon the quantity and credibility of the evidence  how much good evidence is there
MISC	how well does the evidence afford any differentiation of possibilities
MISC	in probability theory  when the judgment of one hypothesis increases  the sum of the judgments for the remaining hypotheses must decrease by the same amount
MISC	in contrast  evidential weight as a construct  grounded in the criterion of justification  is not expected to exhibit this property
MISC	increased support for one possibility does not necessarily impinge on the support for other possibilities
MISC	one source of the confusion between the constructs of likelihood and weight  and of the measures attached to them  is that these constructs and measures generally correlate
MISC	a useful analogy can be drawn here with height and weight as two aspects of size
MISC	though these measures correlate  they capture distinct size constructs
MISC	similarly  probabilities as measures of likelihood and belief functions as measures of justification may correlate  but they capture different degree-of-belief constructs
MISC	there are a number of situations in which justification is of primary interest to the decision maker  or of interest in addition to truth
MISC	for example  justification is of interest in legal settings where the goal is to remove doubt  in stock analysis for which the emphasis is upon justifying recommendations to clients  in diagnostic tasks in which the truth is not feasibly determinable e g   within public policy debates  and in scientific inference citation
MISC	despite this history and their potential usefulness  measures of justification have been little studied empirically or been confounded with measures of likelihood
MISC	the research has probably been somewhat hampered by the respective and different natures of truth and justification
MISC	probability theory as capturing likelihoods benefits from the ultimate realization of the truth in many instances for which it is applied and because of the underpinnings of randomization and relative frequency from which it historically derives citation
MISC	the application of a system used for capturing justification  and the use of dempster-shafer theory for this purpose  is more equivocal about the underlying theoretical mechanisms supporting such judgments citation
MISC	here the argument for applying dempster-shafer theory is based on correspondence between aspects of evidential weight and unique features of the theory  e g   its noncomplementarity and the natural representation of ignorance  i e the case where no information is present citation
MISC	in terms of previous work using dempster-shafer theory  most prior research with this system has been theoretical  for example  in pursuing the use of belief functions for propagating uncertainty in ai expert systems in addition or instead of using probabilities citation
MISC	although sparse  there is some suggestive empirical work
MISC	the cited work of griffin and tversky citation   directly  and the extensive work on the effects of ambiguity in decision making citation   indirectly  testify to the relevance of evidential weight to decision behavior
MISC	in addition  responses in hypothetical legal contexts that emphasize justification exhibit noncomplementarity of degrees of belief in a manner consistent with the tenets of dempster-shafer theory citation
MISC	briggs and krantz citation adopted a measurement perspective and demonstrated that judgments of evidential strength are separable
MISC	that is  subjects    number  showed clear separation of relevant from irrelevant evidence and of designated from surrounding relevant evidence   number   p  number 
MISC	in sum  the results support the value and viability of measuring evidential weight as distinct from the more commonly assessed construct of likelihood
MISC	since likelihood judgments have received more attention than weight judgments and are often confused with them  particular emphasis must be placed on this distinction
MISC	specifically  important distinctions from discussions in the literature need to be drawn  separating justification-based measures such as in the present application of dempster-shafer theory from weak theories of likelihood and from the theory of subjective probability called support theory
MISC	previous research has demonstrated that consistency between people's behavior and their dispositions has predictive validity for judgments of regret
MISC	research has also shown that differences in the personality variable of action orientation can influence ability to regulate negative affect
MISC	individuals with an action orientation experienced more regret for situations involving inaction staying home than situations involving action going out
MISC	state-oriented individuals  however  maintained high levels of regret and did not differ in their regret ratings across either the action or inaction situations
MISC	in study  number   participants made realistic choices involving either an action or inaction
MISC	state-oriented individuals experienced high levels of regret regardless of whether they chose to act or not to act
MISC	efforts at understanding the experiences underlying these feelings of regret have led to different avenues of research
MISC	much of the contemporary work charged with understand regret has spotlighted attention on how imaginary outcomes or  counterfactuals  influence a person's feeling of regret citation
MISC	although this certainly makes up a fascinating facet of the regret process  the  focused attention  of research has lead most researchers to relinquish pursuit of other pre-decisional factors that come into play in the regret process
MISC	recently  however  a good deal of research has begun to examine this aspect of the processes involved in regret
MISC	specifically  research has demonstrated that consistency factors between people and their behavior also play an important role in understanding the regret process citation
MISC	one aspect of the consistency-regret relationship that remains largely uninvestigated is how individual difference factors influence reliance on consistency information
AIMX	in this paper we focus on how the individual difference factor of action-state orientation affects responsiveness to decision factors action vs inaction as well as the ability to regulate bad outcome information in a regretful situation

MISC	the choices of saving and risk are affected by the position of each option in the range of presented options
MISC	this result demonstrated that the range of the options offered as possible saving rates and levels of investment risk influences decisions about saving and risk
MISC	in addition  various measures of risk aversion did not account for the risk taken in each condition
MISC	surprisingly  only the simplest and most direct risk preference measure was a significant predictor of the responses within a particular choice set context  although the actual choices were still very much influenced by the range
MISC	this phenomenon was termed prospect relativity and indicates a lack of stable underlying preference function citation
MISC	a theoretically important question is how far these effects transfer from abstract low-stakes gambles to major financial decisions that could significantly affect long-term well-being
OWNX	if we observe such transfer to realistic financial decisions  then this would have practical significance for marketing  sales  and provision of advice in the financial services industry
MISC	many controversies in medical science can be framed as tension between a coherence approach which seeks logic and explanation and a correspondence approach which emphasizes empirical correctness
MISC	in many instances  a coherence-based theory leads to an understanding of disease that is not supported by empirical evidence
MISC	physicians and patients alike tend to favor the coherence approach even in the face of strong  contradictory correspondence evidence
MISC	examples include the management of atrial fibrillation  treatment of acute bronchitis  and the use of vitamin e to prevent heart disease
MISC	despite the frequent occurrence of controversy stemming from coherence-correspondence conflicts  medical professionals are generally unaware of these terms and the philosophical traditions that underlie them
MISC	learning about the coherence-correspondence distinction and using the best of both approaches could not only help reconcile controversy but also lead to striking advances in medical science
MISC	theories of truth have been debated since the time of aristotle
MISC	more recently in the twentieth century  philosophical discussion has focused on the distinction between  coherence  and  correspondence  theories of truth  citation
MISC	the coherence approach seeks logic and explanation  often through the application of a scientific theory
MISC	the correspondence approach ignores theory in favor of empirical correctness
MISC	for example  the quality of a weather forecast predicting rain might be judged either with regard to a state-of-the-art forecast model coherence or whether it actually rained correspondence
MISC	hammond  citation  has argued that the concepts of coherence and correspondence are necessary for understanding and organizing research findings in the field of judgment and decision making
MISC	likewise  i argue that they are necessary to understand conflicts in medicine
MISC	the distinction between science  making logical sense  coherence and being  empirically correct  correspondence seldom appears in the medical literature
MISC	furthermore  reframing the disagreement in terms of two different  but equally useful  approaches may reduce or eliminate the controversies
MISC	several illustrations of medical controversies show both the tension between the approaches as well as the explicit lack of awareness of these concepts
OWNX	contrary to predictions  self-reported maximizers were more likely to report spontaneous decision making
MISC	however  the relationship between self-reported maximizing and worse life outcomes is largely unaffected by controls for measures of other decision-making styles  decision-making competence  and demographic variables
MISC	behavioral decision research citation characterizes behavior in terms of its consistency with the axioms of utility maximization citation
MISC	a half-century of research has revealed both consistency with and departures from that norm citation
MISC	the latter include  satisficing   choosing an alternative that is  good enough   rather than  maximizing   selecting the option with the highest expected utility citation
MISC	such strategies can be beneficialif they save enough cognitive effort to justify any loss in expected payoff citation
MISC	historically  decision-making research has focused on general processes underlying deviations from normative theory  such as satisficing instead of maximizing citation
MISC	more recently  attention has turned to individual differences in decision making citation   asking whether  through preference or ability  individuals make decisions in consistent ways  across tasks and situations citation
MISC	individual differences that have been examined include risk aversion and risk judgments citation   preference for rational  intuitive  dependent  avoidant  or spontaneous decision-making styles citation   and decision-making competence citation
MISC	building on simon's work  schwartz et al citation developed a scale measuring the degree to which individuals report trying to maximize  rather than satisfice
MISC	it includes items such as  when i watch tv  i channel surf  often scanning through the options even while attempting to watch one program
MISC	  the other items capture ways in which one might explore as much information as possible when making a choice
MISC	given the many options often available in modern life e g   tv channels  cars  jobs  prospective mates  maximizing is no small feat citation
MISC	perhaps because of the challenges of successfully implementing a maximizing strategy  people who attempt to do so fare less well in life  in the sense of experiencing less happiness  optimism  self-esteem  and life satisfaction  while incurring more depression  perfectionism  and regret citation
MISC	moreover  individuals who try to maximize may have less constructive decision-making styles citation
MISC	they rely more on external information sources citation   which might lead them to further question their choices
MISC	thus  these decision-making styles may undermine the very satisfaction that attempted maximizers try so hard to achieve citation
MISC	even when maximizing pays off with better outcomes  satisfaction with those outcomes still may not follow
MISC	one possible explanation is that attempting to maximize encourages focusing on one easily compared feature salary  while neglecting other features important to job satisfaction
MISC	were that the case  then those who attempt to maximize may make poorer decisions  despite strongly desiring the opposite
MISC	conversely  in decisions that lack easily compared criteria  would-be maximizers may face cognitively intractable situations  like those that led simon to propose the advisability of satisficing
MISC	in addition  self-identified maximizers also reported worse outcomes on the decision outcome inventory doi  which includes  number  negative life events that might reflect poor decision making
MISC	these events range broadly in their impacts and frequency  and include ruining clothes in the laundry  having a check bounce  having a mortgage or loan foreclosed  being in jail overnight  and having been diagnosed with type  number  diabetes which is more likely among people who have made poor lifestyle choices
MISC	the analyses in bruine de bruin et al citation focused on developing and validating the dmc and doi measures
MISC	in that context  schwartz et al 's citation self-reported maximization scale was one of several comparison measures
MISC	in particular  the analyses did not examine the extent to which lower dmc scores and problematic decision-making styles account for the correlation between self-reported maximizing and poorer life outcomes
MISC	one such measure is behavioral coping  or taking action to resolve difficult tasks  rather than working around them citation
MISC	because self-reported maximizers may set unattainable goals  they should report less of such coping
MISC	five other measures come from scott and bruce's citation suite of decision-making style scales
MISC	self-reported maximizers should report engaging in  number  more rational decision making  reflecting their perception of systematic deliberation about their choices   number  less intuitive decision making  attempting to avoid relying on feelings and instincts citation    number  more dependence on others  reflecting interpersonal comparisons and the quest for information   number  more avoidant decision making  postponing decisions to search for more information and ponder the possibilities  and  number  less spontaneous decision making  in the sense of taking more time to carefully decide
OWNX	this is a first study on attachment to national and sacred land and land as a protected value
OWNX	a measure of attachment to the land of israel is developed and administered to two groups  jewish college students in israel and the united states
OWNX	levels of land attachment are high and not significantly different in the two groups  with a great deal of variation
OWNX	we demonstrate a significant correlation of positive contagion sensitivity with attachment to the land of israel
OWNX	we also present evidence for linkages between political positions  religiosity  importance of israel  arab aversion  and vulnerability of israel with attachment to land  but these do not fully account for the contagion effects
MISC	this may be linked through evolution to territorial defense
OWNX	national land is the newest aspect of land  since nations and states are relatively new inventions in human history  citation
OWNX	land is often thought of as untradable  which would not be the case if it was just a source of resources
MISC	none of these strong attachments has been systematically studied by psychologists
MISC	protected values are those  unfungible  values or entities which people resist trading for anything
OWNX	in this exploratory study  we develop a measure of attachment to national land space and sacred land place  in the context of the attachment to the land of israel by israeli and american jews
OWNX	although we believe it is worth attention as one analyzes relationships to land  in the present study we have employed a single composite measurement of attachment to the land of israel
MISC	contagion beliefs are based on the sympathetic magical law of contagion   once in contact  always in contact   citation
MISC	when two objects are in physical contact  they pass  essences  between them  such that basic properties of each are embedded in the other
MISC	this process  originally believed to be present only in the minds of people in traditional cultures  is now recognized as a universal part of adult thinking  citation
MISC	contagion effects are typically permanent  and can be accomplished with minimal physical contact
MISC	the transfer of  essence  that psychologically characterizes contagion effects can be mentally represented in at least two ways  citation
MISC	in one conception  the essence is material  and can be eliminated by physical processes
MISC	negative contagion is much more common and more potent than positive contagion  citation
MISC	furthermore  for individuals who experience both  a combination of the two e g   a food touched by a cockroach and one's favorite personal memento  or a sweater worn by adolph hitler and mother teresa almost invariably results in a strong negative outcome
OWNX	this could form the base for a land attachment based on positive contagion
OWNX	in this study  we explore the relation between attachment to the land of israel and measures contagion
OWNX	we also consider some other aspects of land attachment  including its relationship to political views about israel  religiosity  the personal importance of israel  aversion to arabs  views on the vulnerability of israel  and attachment to personal land
OWNX	land is central to this particular conflict  with both sides considering the land to be  theirs
OWNX	it is customary for palestinians who were displaced to wear the key from their former homes in order to remember their specific villages and the land on which they lived  citation
OWNX	although american jews do not live in israel  as part of the jewish diaspora  they often have strong feelings about the land of israel
MISC	standard preference models in consumer research assume that people weigh and add all attributes of the available options to derive a decision  while there is growing evidence for the use of simplifying heuristics
MISC	recently  a greedoid algorithm has been developed  citation  to model lexicographic heuristics from preference data
OWNX	we compare predictive accuracies of the greedoid approach and standard conjoint analysis in an online study with a rating and a ranking task
MISC	the lexicographic model derived from the greedoid algorithm was better at predicting ranking compared to rating data  but overall  it achieved lower predictive accuracy for hold-out data than the compensatory model estimated by conjoint analysis
OWNX	we conclude that the new algorithm will not replace standard tools for analyzing preferences  but can boost the study of situational and individual differences in preferential choice processes
MISC	how do customers choose from the abundance of products in modern retail outlets
MISC	how many attributes do they consider  and how do they process them to form a preference
MISC	these questions are of theoretical as well as practical interest
MISC	at the same time  marketers are interested in more realistic decision models for predicting market shares and for optimizing marketing actions  for example  by adapting products and advertising materials to consumers' choice processes
MISC	in consumer research  decision models based on the idea of utility maximization predominate to date  as expressed in the prevalent use of weighted additive models derived from conjoint analysis to capture preferences  citation
MISC	recently  the field of judgment and decision making has been equipped with a new tool  a greedoid algorithm to deduce lexicographic decision processes from preference data  developed independently by yee et al citation  and kohli and jedidi  citation
OWNX	we aim to bring together these two lines of research by comparing the predictive performance of lexicographic decision processes deduced by the new greedoid algorithm to weighted additive models estimated by full profile regression-based conjoint analysis as a standard tool in consumer research
OWNX	we derive hypotheses from the theoretical framework of adaptive decision making about when which approach should be the better-suited tool  and test them in an empirical study
MISC	the study was designed to assess age differences in choice processes in general and specifically designed to examine the effect of choice set size on performance
MISC	as hypothesized  choice set size was a significant predictor of individuals' ability to choose the best plan
MISC	participants who were presented with  number  plans were less likely to choose the correct prescription drug plan
MISC	age did not have a negative effect on decision performance  however numeracy and speed of processing significantly affected performance across groups
MISC	older adults were more likely to be characterized as satisficers on a decision personality measure  but this categorization did not predict performance on the choice task
MISC	in january  citation   the medicare modernization act known as medicare part d came into effect in the u s   offering millions of medicare beneficiaries the opportunity to purchase insurance coverage to help them pay for their prescription drugs
MISC	that is  older adults buy insurance directly from insurance companies while the government oversees certain aspects of the program
MISC	one consequence of this design is the large number of insurance plans available for beneficiaries
MISC	in most states older adults have more than  number  insurance plans to choose from
MISC	citation  while older adults have reported satisfaction with the program  citation   they have also deemed the program to be too complicated
MISC	indeed  when the kaiser family foundation  number  asked doctors  pharmacists and older adults what they thought about the medicare d program   number  percent  of doctors   number  percent  of pharmacists and  number  percent  of older adults judged it to be too complicated
MISC	one might wonder  therefore  about the usefulness of offering older adults such a large array of choice
MISC	economist and psychologist have long cherished the idea of choice
MISC	recent research  however  has come to question this basic assumption  arguing that too much choice can reduce the quality of the decision and the satisfaction with the decision  citation
MISC	medicare part d was used as the basis of the task because of its current relevance in the real world decision-making of older adults
MISC	knowing what event precipitated a client's abnormal behaviors makes the client appear more normal than if the event is not known  citation
MISC	does such knowledge also influence judgments of the need for psychological treatment  and if so  does it matter whether the precipitating event was inside or outside the client's control
MISC	knowing the precipitant significantly reduced perceptions of clients' need for treatment  but only when the precipitating event was outside the client's control
MISC	these findings call into question the notion that it need always be beneficial for an outside reasoner to uncover the root cause of a client's psychological problems  particularly when the root cause is still unknown to the client
MISC	how do lay people make judgments about another person's need for psychological treatment
MISC	given that recent estimates suggest that approximately one out of every four americans in any given year have a diagnosable mental disorder  citation   it is likely that a great many lay individuals have the opportunity to observe and assess others' behavioral pathology in their daily lives and to influence others' treatment-seeking decisions
MISC	evidence suggests that the treatment-seeking strategies of people suffering from disorders are strongly influenced by lay social networks  citation
MISC	indeed  a prospective client is most likely to first decide  with input from peers  whether treatment might be needed  and to only then make an appointment to talk with a mental health clinician
MISC	it may therefore be of critical importance to examine factors influencing lay judgments of others' need for treatment
MISC	for instance  suppose that  joe   a well-adjusted first-year college student  has a roommate   ted   who has been exhibiting some strange behaviors
MISC	joe notices that ted has frequent memory lapses
MISC	worried by ted's odd behaviors  joe is on the verge of suggesting that ted seek out professional psychological treatment
MISC	suppose  though  that joe then hears through the grapevine that ted's problems all started when his girlfriend cheated on him
MISC	ted was so upset by this event that he started having frequent memory lapses for his usual daily events which  in turn  launched his other problems
MISC	will knowing the initial precipitant of ted's problems now lead joe to perceive ted as being more or less in need of psychological treatment
MISC	or  will joe treat this new information as irrelevant to his judgment of ted's need for treatment
MISC	first  no simple criterion picks out propositions about morality from within the larger set of deontic propositions concerning what is permissible and impermissible in social relations  the law  games  and manners
MISC	third  deontic evaluations depend on inferences  either unconscious intuitions or conscious reasoning
OWNX	fourth  human beliefs about what is  and isn't  moral are neither complete nor consistent
MISC	the article marshals the evidence  which includes new studies  corroborating these principles  and discusses the relations between them and other current theories of moral reasoning
MISC	is it morally wrong to take a paper-clip from your office
MISC	is it morally wrong to steal money from your co-worker
MISC	is it morally wrong to stab your employer
MISC	in the absence of mitigating circumstances  most individuals are likely to agree that all three actions are wrong  but that they increase in heinousness
MISC	psychologists have studied moral evaluations and moral inferences for many years  but they have yet to converge on a single comprehensive theory of these processes  citation
OWNX	we then describe the new theory
OWNX	we present the evidence corroborating it  including some new experimental results
MISC	when participants in psychophysical experiments are asked to estimate or identify stimuli which differ on a single physical dimension  their judgments are influenced by the local experimental context - the item presented and judgment made on the previous trial
MISC	it has been suggested that similar sequential effects occur in more naturalistic  real-world judgments
OWNX	in three experiments we asked participants to judge the prices of a sequence of items
MISC	in experiment  number   judgments were biased towards the previous response assimilation but away from the true value of the previous item contrast  a pattern which matches that found in psychophysical research
OWNX	finally  in all three experiments we found that judgments were biased towards the centre of the range  a phenomenon known as the  regression effect  in psychophysics
MISC	these results suggest that the most recently-presented item is a point of reference for the current judgment
MISC	when people make basic perceptual judgments - about the brightness of a light or the loudness of a tone  for example - their responses are greatly influenced by the context in which the stimuli are presented  a square of a given size is regarded as large when most of the squares in the experiment are of smaller size  but regarded as small when most of the squares are larger  citation
MISC	it has long been known that this insight from psychophysics has relevance to more complex   real world  situations
MISC	psychophysical studies have therefore demonstrated the importance of what may be termed the global experimental context - the set of stimuli employed - in determining perceptual judgments  and this insight has proven useful in more complex and naturalistic judgment tasks
MISC	yet psychophysical judgments are also influenced by local context - by the stimuli presented on the past few trials - and a number of authors have provided evidence that the same principal applies to more complex  non-perceptual decisions too  citation
MISC	the dependency of perceptual judgments on the events of the last few trials has been extensively researched by psychophysicists
MISC	the typical approach is to employ a regression model in which the current judgment  j   is the dependent variable and the current stimulus and stimuli and or responses from trials earlier in the sequence are predictors
MISC	in particular  jesteadt  luce  and green  citation  advocated the use of the following regression model   where p is the value of the stimulus presented on the current trial  p is the value of the stimulus on the previous trial  and j is the value of the judgment made on the previous trial
MISC	equation  has been applied to data from a large number of psychophysical experiments
MISC	in these experiments  the participant is presented with a sequence of stimuli which differ in one physical attribute  such as tones which differ in loudness  and asked to form some judgment of that attribute  the precise nature of the judgment depends on the psychophysical task
MISC	in magnitude estimation experiments  the participant is asked to assign a number which indicates his or her subjective impression of the loudness of each tone  either with respect to an explicit standard  citation  or on an absolute scale  citation
MISC	in cross-modality matching experiments  the participant is asked to adjust the magnitude of one dimension  such as loudness  so that it matches a magnitude on another dimension  such as brightness  citation
MISC	in category judgment experiments  the participant is asked to put each stimulus into one of several categories  citation
MISC	in absolute identification experiments  each stimulus is given a unique label - for example  the stimuli are numbered  number - number  - and the participant is asked to name the stimulus presented on each trial  citation
MISC	equation  has been used to study sequential effects in all of these paradigms
MISC	the details of the results depend somewhat on the experimental task but the general pattern is robust  the response on the current trial is biased towards the judgment made on the previous trial but away from the stimulus presented on that trial  citation
MISC	that is  there is assimilation to the immediately preceding response but contrast to the immediately preceding stimulus
MISC	it is argued that even when participants are asked to judge stimuli with respect to long-term referents  they use the most recently experienced events as a framework for judgment  citation
MISC	many real-world tasks have a structural similarity to magnitude estimation or category judgment  in that people esimate or classify a sequence of stimuli
MISC	however  the stimuli are very different
MISC	the labile mental representations of psychophysical stimuli may be responsible for the observed sequential effects  the inability to form accurate long-term representations may push people towards the use of recent items as a frame of reference
MISC	indeed  many of the models of sequential effects in psychophysical judgment make assumptions which explicitly concern perceptual tasks and which are not readily extended to other situations  citation
OWNX	in three experiments we asked participants to judge the prices of various items
OWNX	in experiment  number   we ask whether judgments of price exhibit sequential dependencies of the type seen in psychophysical experiments
OWNX	using a cognitive task mental calculation and a perceptual-motor task stylized golf putting  we examined differential proficiency using the cws index and several other quantitative measures of performance
MISC	in experiment  number   college students n    number  carried out  number - and  number -digit addition and multiplication problems under time pressure
MISC	in experiment  number   experienced golfers n    number   also college students  putted toward a target from nine different locations
OWNX	within each experiment  we analyzed the same responses using different methods
OWNX	we ranked the performances of the participants according to each measure  then compared the orders using spearman's rs
MISC	for mental calculation  the cws order correlated moderately rs    number  with that of mad
MISC	for putting  the ranking generated by cws correlated   number  with that generated by mad
MISC	consensual answers were also available for both experiments  and the rankings they generated correlated highly with those of mad
MISC	the coherence vs correspondence distinction did not map well onto criteria for performance evaluation
MISC	to evaluate the work of a plumber  therapist  or surgeon  it is necessary to assess on-the-job performance
MISC	while all professionals have their creative moments  in most fields it is the ability to perform a practiced task consistently well that is the hallmark of the expert
MISC	performance assessment is also the key to determining whether a training program or technical innovation is worthwhile
MISC	ideally  assessment can be objective rather than a matter of opinion
MISC	how many leaks were stopped
MISC	how many patients were cured
MISC	such outcome measures capture what hammond  citation  refers to as correspondence competence  in that they focus directly on consequences
MISC	outcomes can also be compared to theory-based standards  for example  updating of opinions should be governed by bayes's theorem
MISC	hammond  citation  refers to this type of standard as a coherence criterion
MISC	these two types of criteria for optimality compare performance to a gold standard  a compelling benchmark against which to measure the behavior
MISC	indeed  some researchers argue that performance can be measured meaningfully only when a gold standard has been agreed upon  citation
MISC	for many professional domains  gold standards simply are not available
MISC	what is the outcome that reflects the quality of a film review  the grade assigned by an instructor  or the sentence imposed by a magistrate
MISC	weiss and shanteau  citation  responded to the challenge that gold standards are elusive by constructing an empirical index  referred to as cws  that does not incorporate ground truth
MISC	they suggested that proficiency has evaluative skill at its core
MISC	whatever the task  one must attend to relevant aspects of the situation and decide what to do
MISC	the ratio is large when the judge discriminates effectively  and is reduced when the judge is inconsistent
MISC	weiss and shanteau stressed that the two properties are not conceptually independent
MISC	the trade-off implied by the ratio definition is the heart of the concept  and any measures that reflect the two properties will do
MISC	an experimental design suitable for cws analysis may be as simple as the presentation of each of several stimuli more than once
MISC	inconsistency implies that a given stimulus presented multiple times inspires different responses on the various occasions
MISC	inconsistency is captured by the mean square between replications
OWNX	the cws approach resembles a coherence criterion  in that it examines purely internal properties of behavior
MISC	however  it differs from other coherence criteria in that while proficient performance inexorably generates high values of cws  there is no theory specifying the optimal behavior
MISC	the absence of optimal answers does not diminish the practical importance of having the capability to evaluate members of the large class of professionals who provide opinions about the status and achievements of people  citation
MISC	opinions often converge toward the truth  citation
MISC	consensual answers have often been proposed as surrogates for correct answers  citation   although the logic of doing so has been criticized  citation
MISC	the gist of the criticism is simply that people may agree on poor answers
MISC	one may view consensus as a coherence criterion  postulating that there exists across people a common latent structure underlying their opinions  citation
OWNX	in the current project  we employed tasks for which there were indisputably optimal responses  namely mental calculation and golf putting
MISC	individual differences in cognitive abilities and skills can predict normatively superior and logically consistent judgments and decisions
MISC	the current experiment investigates the processes that mediate individual differences in risky choices
OWNX	we assessed working memory span  numeracy  and cognitive impulsivity and conducted a protocol analysis to trace variations in conscious deliberative processes
MISC	people higher in cognitive abilities made more choices consistent with expected values  however  expected-value choices rarely resulted from expected-value calculations
MISC	instead  the cognitive ability and choice relationship was mediated by the number of simple considerations made during decision making - e g   transforming probabilities and considering the relative size of gains
MISC	results imply that  even in simple lotteries  superior risky decisions associated with cognitive abilities and controlled cognition can reflect metacognitive dynamics and elaborative heuristic search processes  rather than normative calculations
MISC	modes of cognitive control e g   dual process dynamics and implications for process models of risky decision-making e g   priority heuristic are discussed
MISC	human decision-making is constrained by its bounded rationality and does not always follow normative prescriptions  citation
MISC	nevertheless  individual differences in cognitive abilities and skills predict normatively superior judgment and decision-making  citation
MISC	a variety of theories  such as dual-process theories  attribute the individual differences to deliberative processes  citation   however  the link between decision processes and abilities is largely uninvestigated
MISC	what are the cognitive processes that give rise to the relationship between cognitive abilities and superior decision making under risk
MISC	previous research has examined individual differences in decision making under risk in lotteries with known probabilities
MISC	for low stakes lotteries normative expected utility processes are assumed to be approximated with calculations that multiply probabilities by potential gains losses  i e   expected-value calculations  citation
MISC	frederick has demonstrated that expected-value choices are associated with scores on the cognitive reflection test  which is designed to measure one's reliance on more consciously controlled processes rather than automatic first impressions  citation
MISC	the three-problem cognitive reflection test  which is known to correlate with other general cognitive ability measures  consists of mathematical problems for which an immediate intuitive response is incorrect
MISC	frederick demonstrated that higher scoring individuals did not exhibit the clear non-normative risk asymmetry for gains and losses predicted by prospect theory  citation
MISC	when given a choice between a gain of   number  versus a  number  percent  chance of a   number  gain  prospect theory predicted risk aversion and the selection of the certain   number 
MISC	there are several candidate mechanisms that may account for the link between cognitive abilities and superior decision making under risk
MISC	for example  one can make expected-value choices by performing expected-value calculations
MISC	frederick  citation  suggests that computation of expected values may play a role  although he notes that it is not likely the only factor
MISC	more generally  stanovich and west  citation  suggest that individual differences in normative judgments and decisions often arise from working memory capacity limitations on computation  implying that high ability individuals may make expected-value choices via expected-value calculations
MISC	other research indicates that individual differences in risky decision making may also arise from variations in one's general knowledge and understanding of probabilities - i e   one's numeracy  citation
MISC	people high in numeracy  particularly the ability to comprehend and transform probabilities  are less affected by attribute framing because they can readily transform items such as  number  percent  correct into  number  percent  incorrect and translate percentages to frequencies and vice versa
MISC	judgments of naturalness of foods tend to be more influenced by the process history of a food  rather than its actual constituents
MISC	two types of processing of a  natural  food are to add something or to remove something
MISC	in support of this  skim milk with major subtraction of fat is rated as more natural than whole milk with a small amount of natural vitamin d added
MISC	it is also noted that  additives  is a common word  with a synonym reported by a native speaker in  number  of  number  languages  whereas  subtractive  is lexicalized in only  number  of the  number  languages
OWNX	we consider reasons for additivity dominance  relating it to omission bias  feature positive bias  and notions of purity
MISC	there is no question that the concept of natural is of psychological and commercial importance in the modern developed world
MISC	it is clearly a positive attribute  especially when applied to foods
MISC	in recent years  some studies have shed light on the lay meanings of natural
MISC	it appears that the naturalness of something is related more to its history of contact with humans than it is to actual chemical composition  citation
MISC	understandably  americans rate spring water or natural tomato paste as much more natural than those same entities after a small amount of a natural substance e g   natural minerals or sugar has been added to them
MISC	what is striking is that if it is stipulated that all of the additives are subsequently removed  the resultant substance is rated less natural than the substance with the additive  citation
MISC	the substance that had an additive that was then removed has been subjected to two  processes  but is now identical in content to the original  natural  substance
MISC	this set of results confirmed with the opposite sequence of removing a component of a natural substance  and then replacing the removed component  rozin   number   argues strongly for the importance of process as opposed to content in natural judgments
MISC	while human contact and agency has been identified by a number of authors as enhancing perceptions of risk  citation   it may be that the type of contact is critical
MISC	domestication of plants or animals is associated with intensive human involvement  and major changes in genotypes and phenotypes  yet domesticated species are rated only slightly less natural than their wild equivalents  citation
MISC	on the other hand  insertion of a single gene into a wild species is rated as producing a very large decrease in naturalness  citation
MISC	perhaps  there is something about going  inside  to produce changes that lead to judgments of unnaturalness
OWNX	in analyzing these results  we discovered the major importance of  no additives  as a feature of naturalness and the very rare mention of removal of substances  subtractives 
MISC	these and some other results from this survey are presented here  as illustrations of additivity dominance in judgments of naturalness  and perhaps a more general additivity dominance
OWNX	three studies presented scenarios to lay people to investigate their willingness to restrict imports
MISC	greater restriction was preferred when similar goods were made at home  when the owners of the foreign businesses made very good profits  and  less consistently  when the goods came from a low wage country
MISC	particular reluctance to import from a low-wage country did not vary with whether a home firm was likely to lose business or the level of understanding of comparative advantage  but was related to the profits made by foreign business owners
MISC	the results show that lay people views are based on concern for people in other countries as well as in their own
MISC	do people have a particular reluctance to their country importing goods from low-wage countries
MISC	both these questions have been raised within the field of international economics  citation   but have not to my knowledge been the subject of empirical investigation
MISC	to set the issue in context  it is worth first noting that lay people generally are not convinced of the benefits of free international trade  and recent survey results indicate that a majority of people in many western countries would prefer to see more rather than fewer restrictions on imports than exist at present  citation
MISC	the difference in views may well go back to the nineteenth century  and there have been several suggestions as to why the difference might arise  citation
MISC	and if so  why
MISC	before reviewing some reasons why people might not want to import from low-wage countries  it is worthwhile to note that there at least two reasons for expecting precisely the opposite result
MISC	firstly  and most obviously  goods from such countries are likely to be cheaper
MISC	taking a strictly selfish perspective  the vast majority of people benefit from being able to buy  for example  shirts  dairy products  or cars that are cheaper but of comparable quality to those made in one's own country
MISC	secondly  taking a more utilitarian perspective  poorly paid workers in a foreign country could be seen as more in need of one's custom than higher-paid workers at home or in a rich foreign country
MISC	these three reasons were investigated because they are related to three  misconceptions about comparative advantage  discussed by krugman and obstfeld  citation
MISC	a fourth reason  that people believe that goods imported from low-wage countries might be of lower quality  was not investigated  but instead the effects of such a belief were controlled for in the studies that follow
MISC	perhaps the most obvious reason to resist importing from foreign low-wage countries is the fear that one's compatriots - or perhaps even oneself - might lose their businesses or livelihoods as a result of this competition
MISC	this is by no means an unreasonable fear
MISC	although one can debate precisely how much unemployment arises from this cause rather than from technological advance  there is no doubt that people can lose their jobs or their businesses
MISC	it is also well-known that such losses can be enduring and have serious consequences for people's well-being  citation
MISC	moreover  there is already good empirical evidence that people's opposition to importing goods increases if similar goods are available from producers in one's own country or if the consequences for employment at home are pointed out  although this previous research has not investigated the effect of the wage levels in the country supplying the imports  citation
MISC	it is important to note that this opposition arises not only from those whose livelihoods or businesses are personally affected  but also from others who are concerned for the welfare of producers and workers in their own country
MISC	such concern could be considered as altruism for one's compatriots or as parochialism  and connects to a body of previous research investigating situations in which individuals may act in the interests of an in-group but not in their own interests or those of a wider out-group  citation
MISC	nonetheless  although previous work leads us to expect opposition to imports that compete with home businesses  it is not clear that it should particularly matter if the imports originate in a low-wage country rather than one that pays higher wages but can still produce the goods more cheaply
MISC	very briefly  the principle suggests that where goods should be most efficiently produced depends on the ratio of the costs of production comparative advantage rather than on the absolute costs absolute advantage
MISC	a corollary is that a country need not be the most efficient producer of any commodity in order to benefit from trade
OWNX	ricardo's principle is neither trivial nor obvious  citation   and baron and kemp  citation  found both that the principle was poorly understood by lay people  and that people with a lower understanding of it tended to be more protectionist in outlook
MISC	krugman and obstfeld  citation  suggest that a common myth -  free trade is beneficial only if your country is strong enough to stand up to competition  - arises because of this misunderstanding
MISC	the authors go on to point out that the principle is important because a country which does not have an absolute advantage in producing a good over some other country might still have a comparative advantage
MISC	this comes about because the country's overall lower productivity is then reflected in lower wages  enabling it to sell the good for a lower cost in the other country
MISC	however  because the lower cost is linked to the lower wages  importing such goods might be seen as unfair by people in the other country
MISC	in this case  the opposition would arise from altruistic motives on behalf of the foreign workers
MISC	of course  whether or not the exploited foreign workers really benefit from such altruistic protectionism is debateable
MISC	as krugman and obstfeld  citation  point out   what is the alternative
MISC	the three factors are  whether the goods under consideration for importation come from a low or high wage country  whether similar goods are already made at home and home businesses might suffer from the competition  and the level of profit made by the owners of the foreign businesses
MISC	if there is a particularly strong preference for restricting imports when similar goods are made at home and the imported goods come from a low-wage country  this is a strong indication that the resistance to importing from a low-wage country is related to fear of competition and unemployment at home
MISC	similarly  if people want to restrict imports from a low-wage country because they fear exploitation  we would expect resistance to importing from a country where the business owners make very large profits to be stronger when the imports come from a low-wage country
MISC	the first and third studies employed small samples from new zealand  the second a small sample from eastern germany
MISC	this study compares judgments of the fairness of economic actions among survey populations in switzerland  and both student and non-student groups in the people's republic of china  with the earlier kahneman  knetsch and thaler  citation  surveys of canadians
MISC	however  there were also some significant differences with the influence of fairness being weaker in the two chinese samples than in the groups from the western countries  with the influence being weakest in the chinese student population for the wage related topics
MISC	fairness concerns often play an important role in people's choices and decisions
MISC	although there is little empirical evidence one way or the other  judgments of fairness might well differ among different populations
MISC	as bicchieri  citation  suggests  there is no particular unique norm of fairness  but one of several might be invoked depending on context
MISC	even though there may be a broad consensus within a given culture about how  for example  goods and opportunities should be allocated or distributed  there may be differences between them
MISC	although past studies have shown the nature and importance of fairness concerns and how people commonly respond to unfair behaviour  they have nearly all been conducted in western countries and cultures
MISC	very little evidence has been reported on fairness concerns in eastern countries such as the people's republic of china
MISC	although bian and keller  citation  reported survey responses to some of the questions in kkt by the chinese mba students in shenhai  comparing the results from one city in china to those from usa to infer between-country differences might be subject to some criticism
MISC	as suggested in oosterbeek et al citation   within-country differences can be of the same magnitude as between-country differences
MISC	i choose canada  switzerland  and the p r
MISC	china for comparison  using a common methodology to facilitate the comparisons
MISC	since this study is based on kkt  canada is used as a baseline  and besides  because the canadian survey  citation  was conducted over two decades ago  it provides a limited comparison of judgments over this time period  and switzerland is chosen for sample availability and its having much more in common with canada than with china in terms of culture and level of economic development
MISC	there are  however  some differences  particularly between the chinese respondents and those from both western countries
MISC	all of the studies were based on survey responses to the same questions involving simple narrative vignettes used by kkt in their early telephone interview survey study of fairness among canadian respondents
MISC	these questions allowed tests  for example  of the extent to which people regarded wage cuts as a fair response to market conditions when employers were or were not making normal profits
MISC	this research extends a growing empirical literature that examines patterns of people's fairness judgments - much of it based on not only the methods  but the findings of what people judged to be fair or acceptable actions and what they judged to be unfair in the kkt study
MISC	frey et al citation   for example  used questions similar to those in the kkt study in surveys of german and swiss populations
MISC	shiller  boycko  and korobov  citation  investigated people in the soviet union and the united states with some questions again similar to those used by kkt
MISC	both groups of respondents considered it unfair to increase price in response to a sudden surge of excess demand  a finding by and large consistent with the kkt findings
MISC	however  although showing how people in canada and some other countries evaluate the fairness of various economic behaviours  they are limited to western cultures and were conducted some considerable time ago
MISC	they provide little direct evidence of how people in other cultures might react to similar questions  and given present interest  particularly people in p r
MISC	china
MISC	some related studies have been carried out in china  but they have used other methods and populations
MISC	for example  bian and keller  citation  found that the judgments of chinese business graduate students differed from those of the random household sample of canadians on the fairness of exploiting added market power for short-term profit
MISC	while interesting and perhaps indicative of the possibility of a wider disparity  the difference between the respondents may well be limited to the particular sample population
MISC	in another study  bian and keller  citation  used a different sample of government and business people to ask about life and death issues rather than about common economic behaviors  and while again interesting and useful for studies of decisions by these special groups  the sample and the questions allow little comparability to the kkt or the present studies
MISC	the present study also contributes to the literature on cross-cultural investigation of human fairness judgments  citation  by providing some empirical evidence that can be used to test the existing related theories
MISC	due to the co-existence of political  socioeconomic and cultural differences between the countries for comparison  attributing cross-country difference to cultural factor was challenged
MISC	however  chen and tang  citation  provided some evidence that culture's role in affecting people's economic behavior might be more significant than that of non-cultural factors
MISC	in order to explore the influence of within-country cultural difference  they chose xiamen and lhasa tibet in china for comparison and used singapore as a control sample because of its similarity in culture with xiamen and heterogeneity in political systems  social institutions and level of economic development
MISC	they found no significant differences in people's behavior in an ultimatum game between xiamen and singapore  but people in lhasa differed from the former two samples  suggesting that the influence of culture dominates that of non-cultural factors
MISC	thus  considering the cultural discrepancies between china and the western group in two dimensions see table  number   including power distance and individualism as proposed by hofstede  citation   culture is expected to play a critical role in affecting people's fairness judgments
MISC	more chinese people judge the same action as fair than their counterparts
MISC	hypothesis  number a is formulated based mainly on hofstede  citation
MISC	according to hofstede  citation   large power distance indicates that to a large extent the less powerful members of society within a country accept that power is distributed unequally  and that people generally accept the fact that  power is a basic fact of society that antedate good or evil and its legitimacy is irrelevant  and power-holders are entitled to privileges   citation
MISC	similarly  collectivism  in contrast with high individualism  is associated with the norm that the interests of group outweigh the interests of individuals and that the group provides protection
MISC	so theories on power distance and collectivism predict chinese would be more willing to accept decisions of power-holders or of groups  which supports hypothesis  number a
MISC	however  inglehart's  citation  two dimensions on culture seem to contradict each other in conjecturing people's fairness judgments
MISC	toc paragraph hypothesis  number b --   h number  class  paragraph  sec anchor -- hypothesis  number b   h number  sec end --  more chinese people judge the same action as unfair than their counterparts
OWNX	men and women think and behave differently in many respects  which have received much attention and thus spurred studies on gender differences
MISC	findings from some gender studies on judgments or perceptions of social preference such as fairness or justice  citation  revealed that males and females might differ from each other in this respect
MISC	anticipated regret is an important determinant in risky decision making  however only a few studies have explored its role in problem gambling
MISC	the extent of problem gambling was assessed using the south oaks gambling screen and participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions
MISC	in the risky feedback condition  the feeling of regret was avoided by choosing the risky gamble  whereas in the safe feedback condition the safe gamble was the regret-minimizing option
MISC	problem gambling was associated with the choice of the risky gamble in both conditions indicating less sensitivity to anticipated regret
MISC	these findings suggest that less regret or the poor anticipation of regret might contribute to excessive gambling and thus need to be addressed in cognitive treatments of problem gambling
MISC	cognitive distortions have been identified in the research literature as a key contributing factor to the instigation and maintenance of problem gambling  citation
MISC	numerous studies have shown that gamblers hold irrational beliefs and suffer from cognitive biases such as the illusion of control  the gambler's fallacy  and the attribution bias  which lead to inaccurate inferences about outcome probabilities  citation
MISC	the resulting overestimation of the chances to win and the underestimation of possible losses propel individuals to place more risky bets and encourage persistent gambling
MISC	besides erroneous beliefs about probabilities  gambling persistence and risk taking may also be affected by the anticipation of emotions associated with gambling outcomes
MISC	the role of anticipated emotions is well documented in the literature on decision making  with anticipated regret receiving particular attention  citation
MISC	however  relatively few studies have examined anticipated regret in the context of gambling
MISC	wolfson and briggs  citation  investigated the intentions of  number  lottery players to participate in a newly introduced lottery in the united kingdom and found that  number  percent  were willing to purchase tickets because they anticipated feeling regret if their numbers came up
MISC	this share increased to  number  percent  for those who played regularly with the same set of numbers
MISC	in a comprehensive study of the dutch postcode lottery  zeelenberg and pieters  citation  showed that the regret people expected to feel if they decided not to play and discovered that their neighbor had won significantly contributed to their intention to participate in the lottery in the near future
MISC	rae and haw  citation  assessed the effects of anticipated regret  disappointment  and elation  on the persistence in gambling of  number  gamblers and found that anticipated emotions did not predict gambling persistence
MISC	this is due to the fact that none of the studies screened the participants for gambling problems making it impossible to assess how many of them actually met the criteria for problem or pathological gamblers
MISC	first  it estimated the effect of gambling preference on the anticipation of regret
MISC	previous research has suggested that although erroneous beliefs and distorted cognitions are common among all types of gamblers  pathological gamblers seem to suffer more cognitive illusions  citation   endorse more irrational beliefs  citation  and to be more convinced in their irrational beliefs than social gamblers  citation
MISC	in a recent study  tochkov  citation  showed that high-frequency gamblers were less able to anticipate regret than low-frequency gamblers indicating that inaccurately anticipated regret is a possible contributing factor to persistent gambling
MISC	participants were asked to choose gambles with fictitious monetary outcomes and imagine how they would feel once they learn the outcome of their decision
MISC	a week later  the same participants were asked to play the same gambles for real with actual monetary wins and losses and rate their regret
MISC	tochkov  citation  reported that the difference between anticipated and actual regret was significantly larger for high-frequency gamblers as compared to that of low-frequency gamblers
MISC	these findings suggest that when gamblers do not anticipate the negative feelings of regret they might experience once they learn the outcome of their bet  they are more tempted to continue gambling
MISC	in contrast  the anticipation of regret about gambling outcomes could serve as a natural inhibitor to continuous gambling
MISC	this line of reasoning is supported by evidence from a number of studies which found that the anticipation of regret decreases the intentions of engaging in risky and potentially addictive behaviors  citation
MISC	in a recent study  fernandez-duque and landers  citation  showed that individuals experienced more regret than they had anticipated  which in turn made them more risk averse in a subsequent gambling task
OWNX	the present study explores the relationship between anticipation of regret and gambling preferences by giving gamblers the choice between two gambles  one of which promised to reveal the outcome of the selected option only partial feedback and the other the outcome of both the selected and the rejected options complete feedback
MISC	following zeelenberg et al citation   two experimental conditions were created  each of which contained a partial and a complete feedback option
MISC	in the risky feedback condition  partial feedback was associated with the risky gamble  whereas in the safe feedback condition the regret-minimizing option was the safe gamble
MISC	in contrast  a stronger gambling preference would be related to risk seeking regardless of the expected feedback
MISC	in this article a broad perspective incorporating elements of time series theory is presented for conceptualizing the data obtained in multi-trial judgment experiments
MISC	recent evidence suggests that sequential context effects  assimilation and contrast  commonly found in psychophysical judgment tasks  may be present in judgments of abstract magnitudes
MISC	a time series approach for analyzing single-subject data is developed and applied to expert prognostic judgments of risk for heart disease with an emphasis on detecting possible sequential context effects
MISC	contrast and assimilation were produced by cue series  the latter occurring more frequently
MISC	experts also showed assimilation of prior responses that was independent of the cue series input
MISC	time series analysis also revealed that abrupt or large trial-by-trial changes in the value of cues that receive the most attention in prognostic judgment tasks can disrupt the accuracy of these judgments
MISC	many judgment experiments may be viewed as involving two time series  a series of stimuli presented by the experimenter  and a series of responses provided by the subject
MISC	over the years various theories of human judgment have been proposed
MISC	one thing all these theories have in common is that they have been  and are being  developed using single-subject repeated measures experiments
MISC	whether judgment data are modeled using multiple regression  as is typical in the judgment analysis paradigm often associated with social judgment theory  citation   by single-subject anova which forms the foundation of information integration theory  citation   by conjoint analysis  citation   or by fast and frugal heuristics  such as take the best  citation   or the matching heuristic  citation   the data are obtained by presenting the subject with a series of stimuli to be judged and recording a series of responses
MISC	such idiographic designs and analysis of their ensuant data are the focus of this article
MISC	contrast and assimilation are psychological processes involving the sequential context in which judgments are made
MISC	in a variety of psychophysical judgment paradigms employing large numbers of trials e g   absolute and relative magnitude scaling tasks  absolute and relative identification tasks sequential context effects are frequently observed  citation
MISC	assimilation occurs when the response to a given stimulus intensity tends to be larger when the immediately preceding stimulus is of greater intensity than the current stimulus  and tends to be smaller when the preceding stimulus intensity is less than that of the current stimulus
MISC	contrast occurs when the response to a given stimulus intensity tends to be smaller when the immediately preceding stimulus is of greater intensity than the current stimulus  and tends to be larger when the preceding stimulus intensity is less than that of the current stimulus
MISC	decarlo and cross  citation  discuss various theoretical models of psychophysical judgment that have been proposed to explain sequential context effects in magnitude scaling experiments and show how these can be evaluated using time series regression
MISC	stewart et al citation  discuss relative judgment models in absolute identification tasks
MISC	the question is whether similar sequential context effects operate in expert judgment tasks
MISC	expert prognostic judgments  such as a clinician's estimate of the likelihood that a patient will suffer a heart attack in the future based on current signs and symptoms  have been studied by judgment researchers employing multiple regression analysis  citation
MISC	to illustrate how sequential context effects might manifest themselves  let us examine what could happen with a single dichotomous cue
MISC	for example  consider the clinician faced with the prognostic task of estimating a patient's risk for coronary heart disease chd and say that the cue in question is whether or not the patient has diabetes
MISC	in psychophysical judgment tasks  such as magnitude scaling  the observed response provided by the subject is interpreted to be an estimate of the sensory magnitude associated with a given  unidimensional  stimulus intensity
MISC	in multi-cue judgment tasks where there is not necessarily an objective stimulus intensity to be scaled  the response provided by the subject may be interpreted differently
MISC	in such judgment tasks  the observed response may be interpreted as an estimate of an integrated judgment along a more abstract subjective continuum  such as patient-risk for chd
MISC	vlaev and chater  citation  asked whether contrast and assimilation  as observed in psychophysical judgments  would operate when people make estimates of more abstract magnitudes
MISC	they examined estimates of cooperativeness made in a series of strategic choice decisions i e   prisoner's dilemma games
MISC	in their experiment  playing a random sequence of  number  cooperative and uncooperative games produced greater mean differences in cooperation rates  number  percent  vs  number  percent  when compared to conditions composed of  number  cooperative games followed by  number  uncooperative games  number  percent  vs  number  percent   and vice versa  number  percent  vs  number  percent 
MISC	the current article investigates whether such sequential context effects operate in expert prognostic tasks but takes a different theoretical and analytical approach
MISC	when sequential context effects associated with a cue in a multi-cue judgment task are observed  they are here interpreted to mean that a cue's influence as represented by its  beta  weight is altered by the values that the cue takes over consecutive trials
MISC	assimilation means that when the cue values on trials t and t- number  are different  the cue's influence is smaller than when the cue values on these trials are the same
MISC	contrast means that when the cue values on trials t and t- number  are different  the cue's influence is larger than when the cue values on these trials are the same
MISC	although this interpretation may sound odd to a psychophysicist  it is consistent with traditional methods of demonstrating sequential context effects
MISC	for example  one way of demonstrating these effects is to plot the mean response to the stimulus value on the current trial as a function of the differences between the stimulus value on the current and immediately preceding trial
OWNX	here we focus on the diabetes cue for illustration
MISC	subject  number  squares and solid line shows assimilation  the mean rating of risk for the current patient is biased toward the diabetes status of the prior patient
MISC	subject  number  triangles and dashed line shows contrast  the mean ratings are biased away from the diabetes status of the prior patient
MISC	although these regression analyses illustrate that the cue's influence changes when assimilation and contrast take place  this approach is flawed because of its piecemeal nature  data from two subsets of trials have been analyzed separately
MISC	a better approach would be to analyze the data from all the trials simultaneously
MISC	time series analysis can be used to test hypotheses that sequential context effects are operating in the series of responses obtained from a single subject
MISC	specific models can be constructed to isolate sequential context effects produced by the cue stimulus series and those operating independently in the judgment response series
MISC	in the present article a time series approach is developed by extending ideas discussed in the context of psychophysical research to cover multi-cue judgment tasks
MISC	before preceding to discuss the application of time series analysis  a broad perspective in which to position time series theory and methods in psychological research is needed
MISC	following this discourse  an illustrative application is presented with an emphasis on detecting possible sequential context effects operating in expert prognostic judgments of risk for heart disease
MISC	which statement conveys greater risk    number  people die from cancer every day  or   number   number  people die from cancer every year 
MISC	in statistics where both frequencies and temporal information are used to convey risk  two theories predict opposite answers to this question
MISC	construal level theory predicts that   number  people die from cancer every day  will be judged as more risky  while the ratio bias predicts that the equivalent   number   number  people die from cancer every year  will result in higher risk judgments
MISC	an experiment investigated which format produces higher risk ratings  and whether ratings are influenced by increasing the salience of the numerical or temporal part of the statistic
MISC	forty-eight participants were randomly assigned to a numerical  temporal or control salience condition  and rated risk framed as number of deaths per day or per year
MISC	the year format was found to result in higher perceived risk  indicating that the ratio bias effect is dominant  but there was no effect of salience
MISC	the perception of risk is an important area of research not only for understanding cognitive processes  but also for its practical applications in conveying risk information to the public
MISC	in the health domain  perceived risk is generally regarded as the first step in models of health behaviour  and a necessary but not sufficient condition for behaviour change see weinstein  citation  and van der pligt  citation  for reviews
MISC	although other factors have been shown to mediate this relationship  citation   conveying a sense of risk is a major focus of health communication  with the aim of influencing individual judgment and decision making
MISC	the present research investigates how risk perception is affected by the framing  citation  of incidence rates  which are often used to convey risk information to the public
MISC	humans and other animals are idiosyncratically sensitive to risk  either preferring or avoiding options having the same value but differing in uncertainty
MISC	because such models do not place any importance on uncertainty per se  utility curve-based accounts predict indifference between risky and riskless options that offer the same distribution of rewards
OWNX	here we show that monkeys strongly prefer uncertain gambles to alternating rewards with the same payoffs  demonstrating that uncertainty itself contributes to the appeal of risky options
OWNX	based on prior observations  we hypothesized that the appeal of the risky option is enhanced by the salience of the potential jackpot
OWNX	to test this  we subtly manipulated payoffs in a second gambling task
MISC	together  these results challenge utility curve-based accounts of risk sensitivity  and suggest that psychological factors  such as outcome salience and uncertainty itself  contribute to risky decision-making
MISC	millions of people regularly play the lottery despite the fact that tickets typically have an expected value of less than half of their price  citation
OWNX	the utility curve is a hypothetical construct linking observable values of outcomes onto subjective  internal values
MISC	because decision makers exhibit diminishing marginal utilities in most contexts  the average utility of a large and small outcome is hypothesized to be less than the utility of a middle-sized outcome
MISC	consequently  decision makers should be risk-averse in these situations
MISC	conversely  contexts in which marginal utilities are convex should promote risk-seeking
MISC	the fact that lottery advertisements focus on the specific benefits of winning suggests that drawing attention to the possible jackpot can influence the decision to gamble  citation
MISC	indeed  several reports have suggested that the relative salience of different outcomes in a risky situation may influence the way the gamble as a whole is evaluated  citation
MISC	outcomes that are more vivid  easier to remember  or more emotional are often seen as more likely - an idea known as the  availability heuristic  in economics  citation
MISC	in a similar vein  several studies have suggested that feelings about possible outcomes can influence the appeal of the gamble  citation
OWNX	we use the term salience to indicate the attentional weighting of this possibility in decision-making
MISC	however  this biasing may be stronger in the presence of uncertainty  when options are certain  biasing may be less likely to occur
MISC	when a decision-maker considers whether to gamble  he or she compares the value of the safe option to this biased valuation of the risky option
MISC	the alternating option provided identical sets of outcomes  and therefore identical utilities  to the monkeys  so any preference between these options cannot reflect utility weighting
OWNX	we also hypothesized that the risk-seeking we observed reflects  at least in part  the salience of large rewards
MISC	if monkeys preferentially attend to the larger outcome  they should be more sensitive to small changes in its size
OWNX	we therefore examined monkeys' sensitivity to incremental changes in the sizes of large and small outcomes in a second experiment
MISC	people overestimate their affective reactions to future events and decisions - a phenomenon that has been termed  impact bias
MISC	it is generally assumed that this is because diary completion helps people to realize that they will be distracted from the focal event
MISC	however  there is another possibility  de-biasing may occur because diary completion interferes with the processing responsible for the bias
OWNX	in a first experiment  we showed that diary completion also lowers affect associated with past decisions
OWNX	in a second experiment  we showed that solving anagrams has the same effect
MISC	recent evidence suggests that people estimate that their affective reactions to future events will be more intense than they actually are  citation
MISC	these misjudgments have been termed  impact bias   citation
MISC	wilson et al citation  suggested that the psychological mechanism that underlies this phenomenon is what they termed  focalism 
MISC	in wilson et al 's words  when people generate predictions about how they will be feeling after a future event  people focus too much on the event in question and not enough on the consequences of other future events   citation
MISC	focalism has also been found to influence people's judgments of their affective reactions to past events  citation
MISC	for example  mitchell et al citation  found that people's retrospective judgments of enjoyable events  such as bicycle trips and vacations  were more positive than their judgments that were contemporaneous with these events
MISC	it has been suggested that retrospective focalism arises for the same reason as prospective focalism  people pay too much attention to the focal event and not enough to the consequences of other events that occur at the same time as the focal event  citation
MISC	wilson et al citation  demonstrated that asking people to complete a diary of activities in which they expected to be engaged around the time of the focal event reduced the intensity of the emotions associated with that event
MISC	they argued that the diary manipulation had its effect by reducing focalism  specifically  they suggested that the effect of diary completion is to reduce the extent to which people expect to be thinking about the focal event after it has occurred
MISC	they suggested that this effect could be brought about in one of two ways
MISC	first  asking people to complete a diary may make them realize that other events would occupy their thoughts and thereby distract them from thinking about the target event
MISC	second  people may focus their attention on the affective consequences of the other events rather than on the likelihood of being distracted by those events
MISC	in other words  they may believe that the affective consequences of the focal event will be diluted or cancelled out by the affective consequences of the other events occurring around the same time
MISC	as a result  they attenuate their affective forecasts of the focal event
MISC	in fact  wilson et al citation  found that the affective valence of events in participants' diaries had no effect on the level of affect that was forecast for the focal event
OWNX	here we have two aims
OWNX	first  we aim to investigate whether diary completion attenuates retrospective judgment of post-decisional affect i e   regret  disappointment as well as prospective judgments of affect
OWNX	second  we aim to investigate the adequacy of the distraction account as an account of defocusing of both retrospective and prospective judgments
OWNX	in particular  we shall contrast it with a task interference account
MISC	according to this alternative view  defocusing occurs because processing subserving affect assessment is impaired by costs associated with task-switching
MISC	more specifically  judgments of affect associated with a particular event are likely to involve cognitive processes that operate on the contents of working memory
MISC	requiring people to perform an additional task diary completion disrupts these processes because it makes its own demands on working memory
MISC	several decision-making models predict that it should be possible to affect real binary choices by manipulating the relative amount of visual attention that decision-makers pay to the two alternatives
OWNX	we present the results of three behavioral experiments testing this prediction
MISC	visual attention is controlled by manipulating the amount of time subjects fixate on the two items
MISC	appetitive items are  number  to  number  percent  more likely to be chosen in the long fixation condition
MISC	in contrast  aversive items are  number  percent  less likely to be chosen in the long fixation condition
MISC	many behavioral scientists believe that individuals make choices by first assigning values to objects and then selecting the option with the highest value  perhaps with some noise
MISC	this raises several questions  how are the values that guide decisions henceforth called decision values computed
MISC	what are the properties of those processes
MISC	these questions are receiving increasing amounts of attention in psychology  behavioral neuroscience  and neuroeconomics
MISC	in particular  several models of how the decision values are computed and compared have been proposed  citation
MISC	these models are based on a simple idea
MISC	a decision value is a forecast  made prior to consumption  of the actual value that will be derived from consuming an item
MISC	the models assume that decision values are computed by making repeated noisy estimates of the consumption value that are then integrated over time
MISC	interestingly  some of these models have received considerable empirical support in both human behavioral and monkey electrophysiology experiments
MISC	for example  they predict that the decision value assigned to an item  and thus the willingness-to-pay for it  can depend on the amount of time spent computing it  citation
MISC	in a series of experiments testing this prediction  armel and rangel  citation  showed that the willingness-to-pay for appetitive items increases significantly with computation time  and that the opposite is true for aversive items
MISC	krajbich  armel  and rangel  citation  extended this class of models to investigate the role of visual attention on binary choice
OWNX	their model  described in the next section  makes two stark predictions about the impact on choice of exogenous changes of visual attention
MISC	firt  it predicts that it should be possible to increase the probability that an item be chosen by changing the relative amount of time that subjects fixate on the item during the decision-making process
MISC	the properties of the value computation and comparison processes should be of interest to behavioral scientists since they determine the extent to which individuals are able to make quality choices  and the circumstances in which they are able to do so
MISC	in addition  the properties of these processes could have important implications for the behavioral and welfare effects of practices such as in-store marketing
MISC	for example  weber and kirsner  citation  asked subjects to make choices between pairs of lotteries from a graphical display and compared two conditions  one in which larger payoffs were depicted with larger fonts  and one in which smaller payoffs were depicted with larger fonts
MISC	they found that subjects were more willing to choose the riskier gamble with the potentially larger payoffs in the first condition
MISC	a common interpretation of these results is that outcomes with the larger font size received more attention and that this lead to a relative overweithting of those outcomes
MISC	related to this  tversky and kahneman  citation  have argued that the s-shaped probability weighting function of prospect theory is driven by perceptual biases that place excessive relative attention on very low and very high probability events  which as a result are overweighted relative to mid-range probabilities
MISC	a typical experiment shows that the subjects' reports about how much they like seeing an stimulus e g   a chinese ideogram or a foreign language word can be increased through repeated and brief previous exposures to the items  citation
OWNX	as far as we know  this is the first experimental study of the impact on decisions of exogenously and explicitly manipulated fixation durations during the process of choice
MISC	the closest experiment is the work by shimojo et al citation  who study the role of visual attention on judgments about facial attractiveness
OWNX	decisions in the field are consistent with biased beliefs  although we observe significant individual heterogeneity in the population
OWNX	we speculate as to the source of this correlation locus of control  and suggest future research which could test this speculation
OWNX	almost every decision we make involves uncertainty in some way
MISC	intuitive ideas of randomness depart systematically from the laws of chance
MISC	although many decisions based on these heuristics are consistent with probability theory  there are also situations where heuristics lead to statistical illusions and suboptimal actions
MISC	both of these illusions characterize individuals' perceptions of non-autocorrelated random sequences
MISC	the gambler's fallacy is a belief in negative autocorrelation of a non-autocorrelated random sequence of outcomes like coin flips
MISC	for example  imagine jim repeatedly flipping a fair coin and guessing the outcome before it lands
MISC	if he believes in the gambler's fallacy  then after observing three heads in a row  his subjective probability of seeing another head is less than  number  percent 
MISC	thus he believes a tail is  due   and is more likely to appear on the next flip than a head
MISC	in contrast  the hot hand is a belief in positive autocorrelation of a non-autocorrelated random sequence of outcomes like winning or losing
MISC	for example  imagine rachel repeatedly flipping a fair coin and guessing the outcome before it lands
MISC	thus she believes that she is  hot  and more likely than chance to guess correctly
MISC	notice that these two biases are not simply opposites
MISC	the gambler's fallacy describes beliefs about outcomes of the random process e g   heads or tails  while the hot hand describes beliefs of outcomes of the individual like wins and losses
MISC	in the gambler's fallacy  the coin is due  in the hot hand the person is hot
MISC	the gambler's fallacy and its opposite  the hot outcome  are beliefs about the coin's outcomes involving negative versus positive autocorrelation of random outcomes
MISC	the hot hand and its opposite  the stock of luck  are beliefs about the individual's success involving positive versus negative autocorrelation of winning or losing
MISC	thus someone can believe both in the gambler's fallacy that after three coin flips of heads tails is due and the hot hand that after three wins they will be more likely to correctly guess the next outcome of the coin toss
MISC	these biases are believed to stem from the same source  the representativeness heuristic  as discussed below  citation
MISC	empirical data  while difficult to obtain and to code  can provide an important complement and robustness check on other methods in investigating biases
MISC	participants in the casinos are making real decisions with their own money on the line
MISC	further  the participants represent a more motivated sample than typical students at a university  gamblers have a very real incentive to learn the game they are playing and to make decisions in accordance with their beliefs
OWNX	thus we will have to be cautious in our claims of external validity from this study
OWNX	nonetheless  we believe that the demonstration of these biases in the field at the level of the individual is an important contribution in and of itself
MISC	the gambler's fallacy is defined as an incorrect belief in negative autocorrelation of a non-autocorrelated random sequence
MISC	for example  individuals who believe in the gambler's fallacy believe that after three red numbers appearing on the roulette wheel  a black number is  due   that is  is more likely to appear than a red number
MISC	after seeing a string of one outcome  subjects were significantly more likely to guess the other  an effect referred to in that literature as negative recency  citation
OWNX	ayton and fischer  citation  also demonstrate the existence of gambler's fallacy beliefs in the lab when subjects choose which of two colors will appear next on a simulated roulette wheel
MISC	gal and baron  citation  show that gambler's fallacy behavior is not simply caused by boredom  participants in their experiments were asked how they would best maximize their earnings  and they responded with gambler's fallacy type logic
MISC	the gambler's fallacy is thought to be caused by the representativeness heuristic  citation
OWNX	here  chance is perceived as  a self-correcting process in which a deviation in one direction induces a deviation in the opposite direction to restore the equilibrium   citation
OWNX	we test for the gambler's fallacy in our data by looking at the impact of previous outcomes on current bets at roulette
MISC	people who believe in the gambler's fallacy should be less likely to bet on a number that has previously appeared
MISC	for example  individuals who believe in hot outcome believe that after three red numbers appearing on the roulette wheel  another red number is more likely to appear than a black number because red numbers are hot
MISC	notice that here the outcomes are hot e g   red numbers  rather than individuals  as in the hot hand  below
MISC	in the lab  the literature on probability matching also provides evidence favoring hot outcome beliefs
MISC	in particularly long sequences of the probability matching game  participants were significantly more likely to guess the same outcome as had been observed previously
OWNX	we will test for hot outcome beliefs in our data by looking at the impact of previous outcomes on current bets at roulette
MISC	if gamblers believe in hot outcomes  they should be more likely to bet on an outcome that has previously been observed
MISC	thus a positive relationship between previously-observed outcomes and current bets is indicative of a belief in hot outcomes
MISC	hot hand is different from hot outcome
MISC	rather than believing that a particular outcome is hot  individuals who believe in the hot hand believe that a particular person is hot
MISC	for example  if an individual has won in the past  whatever numbers they choose to bet on are likely to win in the future  not just the numbers they've won with previously
MISC	gilovich  vallone and tversky  citation  demonstrated that individuals believe in the hot hand in basketball shooting  and that these beliefs are not correct i e   basketball shooters' probability of success is indeed serially uncorrelated
MISC	other evidence from the lab shows that subjects in a simulated blackjack game bet more after a series of wins than they do after a series of losses  both when betting on their own play and on the play of others  citation
MISC	participants exhibit more confident in their guesses of what color will next appear after a string of correct guesses than after a string of incorrect guesses
MISC	explanations for the hot hand are numerous
MISC	it is clearly related to the illusion of control  citation   where individuals believe they can control outcomes that are  in fact  random
MISC	gilovich et al    citation  suggest that the hot hand also arises out of the representativeness heuristic  just as the gambler's fallacy
MISC	they write        this second explanation is supported by data in which participants are asked to generate strings of random numbers
MISC	the strings generated produced significantly fewer runs of the same outcome than a truly random sequence would  citation
MISC	in particular  hot hand beliefs predict that after winning  individuals will increase the number of bets they place and after losing  decrease them
MISC	just as the gambler's fallacy and the hot outcome are opposing biases  the hot hand has an opposing bias  referred to here as  stock of luck  beliefs
MISC	individuals believe they have a stock or fixed amount of luck and  once it's spent  their probability of winning decreases
MISC	thus after a string of wins  individuals are less likely to win rather than more likely as predicted by the hot hand because they have exhausted their stock of luck
MISC	the effect has been demonstrated in the lab by leopard  citation  who examines choice behavior in a series of gambles and demonstrates that subjects take more risk after losing than after winning  suggesting that their bad luck is about to change or their good luck about to run out
MISC	stock of luck beliefs predict that after winning  individuals will decrease the number of bets they place and  after a loss  increase them
MISC	a large literature identifies individual differences in risk attitudes  citation
MISC	in addition  previous work has identified individual heterogeneity in biased beliefs about sequences of gambles
MISC	friedland  citation  uses a personality inventory to categorize individuals into luck-oriented and chance-oriented
MISC	in a questionnaire design  he finds gamblers' fallacy behavior in luck-oriented individuals but no such behavior  and in particular  no dependence of current bets on past outcomes  in chance-oriented individuals
MISC	in the field  previous work has also found individual heterogeneity in biased beliefs
MISC	keren and wagenaar  citation  examine blackjack play of  number  individuals who played at least  number  hands and changed their bets over time
MISC	of these   number  had relationships between previous outcomes and bet changes thus  exhibiting a bias of some sort
MISC	fourteen of them increased their bets after they won and decreased them after they lost consistent with the hot hand  while  number  decreased their bets after winning and increased them after losing consistent with stock of luck
OWNX	as in these studies  we will use our data to analyze individual differences in betting behavior
MISC	only two previous papers examine field behavior at roulette
MISC	the first is an observational sociological field study by oldman  citation  which informally reports both the gambler's fallacy and the hot outcome
MISC	he writes that   t he bet on a particular spin tends to be placed on outcomes that are  due' either because they have not occurred for some time or because that is the way  things are running
MISC	 ' p  number 
MISC	the second source  wagenaar  citation   discusses data from  number  roulette players in a casino who stayed between  number  and  number  spins each
MISC	of the  number  players who varied their bets most  he finds after a win  number  percent  of bets involve increased risk hot hand and  number  percent  involve decreased risk stock of luck
MISC	however  wagenaar does not present an analysis of how individuals differ on this dimension
OWNX	while previous papers have investigated the gambler's fallacy and hot hand biases  our work makes two important and original contributions
MISC	first  it provides a field setting in which it is possible to investigate both biases at once
MISC	these biases have been analyzed together only in the lab  citation
OWNX	second  our empirical data will allow us to identify individual differences in these biases
OWNX	in this study we use observational data from the field  individuals betting at roulette in a casino
MISC	roulette is a useful game for a number of reasons
MISC	second  each player has his or her own colored chips  thus tracking an individual's betting behavior is feasible
OWNX	thus roulette is likely to suffer from less selection bias than craps  although we are already selecting participants from the casino gambling population  mentioned above as an unavoidable selection bias
MISC	each space is red or black  with the  number  and  number  colored green
MISC	the wheel is arranged as shown in figure  number   such that red and black numbers alternate
MISC	players arrive at the roulette table and offer the dealer money either cash or casino chips
MISC	in exchange  they are given special roulette chips for betting at this wheel
MISC	these chips are not valid anywhere else in the casino  and each player at the table has a unique color of chips
MISC	players bet by placing chips on a numbered layout  the wheel is spun and a small white ball rolled around its edge
MISC	next  the dealer clears away all losing bets  players who had bet on the winning number in some configuration are paid in their own-colored chips and a new round of betting begins
MISC	figure  number  shows a typical layout  along with the types of bets that can be made
MISC	players can place their bets on varying places on the layout
MISC	bets of the type on the number  number  are called  straight up  bets
MISC	these are bets on a single number
MISC	if the number comes up on the wheel  this bet would pay the player  number  for  number   number  to  number 
MISC	that is  when  number  chip is bet  the dealer pays the player  number  chips directly  and the chip that was bet is not removed from the table
MISC	bets of the type between the  number  and  number    line bets  are bets on two numbers
MISC	if either of the numbers comes up  this bet pays the player  number  for  number 
MISC	players can also bet on combinations of  number  numbers by the  number  which pay  number  for  number   combinations of  number  numbers on the corner of  numbernumbernumbernumber  which pay  number  for  number   or combinations of  number  numbers by the  numbernumber  which pay  number  for  number 
MISC	players can  of course  bet on  outside  bets like red black  even odd and low high
MISC	since the house advantage on almost all bets at the wheel is the same  there is no economic reason to bet one way or another or for that matter  at all
MISC	recent research suggesting that people who maximize are less happy than those who satisfice has received considerable fanfare
OWNX	we present a more reliable and valid measure for future researchers to use
MISC	the term  satisfice  was coined by herbert simon  citation  to describe a decision-making strategy that strives for adequacy  rather than optimality
MISC	people generally satisfice  according to simon  citation    because they have not the wits to maximize  p  number 
MISC	more recently  the tendency to satisfice maximize has been conceptualized as an individual difference or trait  citation
MISC	findings based on the use of this scale have appeared in top academic journals  citation   and inferences drawn about maximizers have been reported in major media  citation  and a best-selling book  citation
MISC	given that strong inferences have been drawn about the mental well-being of maximizers versus satisficers - based on responses to the maximization scale - it is especially important that we have confidence in the construct validity of the measure
MISC	highhouse and diab  citation  suggested that the maximization scale falls short of commonly accepted psychometric standards
OWNX	we also investigated the psychometric properties of several proposed refined versions of the scale
MISC	four sets of analyses are reported
MISC	the first analysis confirms the  number -part factor structure of the scale and assesses its reliability
OWNX	the second analysis identifies those items that do not perform well on the basis of internal  external  and judgmental criteria  and develops three shorter versions of the scale
MISC	in the third analysis  the three refined versions of the scale are cross-validated to confirm dimensionality  reliability  and validity
MISC	the fourth analysis uses an experiment in an investment decision making context to assess the reliability and nomological validity of the refined scales
MISC	these analyses lead us to conclude that a shorter   number -item maximization scale performs best and should be used by future researchers
MISC	it is hoped that clarification of the conceptual underpinnings of the maximization construct and development of a refined scale will enhance its use among researchers across several of the social science disciplines
MISC	researchers have long recognized that decision making is an adaptive process  with individuals making tradeoffs between accuracy and effort  citation
MISC	however  schwartz et al citation  have suggested that the tendency to optimize when making decisions may manifest as a dispositional variable  and they formalized a distinction between maximizers and satisficers as an individual difference
MISC	whereas some people consistently try to choose the  best   others tend to  satisfice  and settle for options that are simply good enough  citation
MISC	schwartz  and his colleagues  citation  proposed that this difference may represent a general behavioral tendency  and they developed a scale to capture the distinction between decision makers who tend to  maximize  and those who tend to satisfice
MISC	schwartz et al citation  validated the maximization scale across a number of survey and experimental studies
MISC	it was administered to over  number  participants in the u s and canada  ranging in age from  number  to  number  and coming from diverse ethnic backgrounds
MISC	the results indicated that maximizers tend to pursue the best option  not simply an option that is good enough  and are constantly asking themselves  is this the best outcome  rather than  is this a good outcome
MISC	  in addition  an examination of the relation between scores on the maximization scale and a range of psychological correlates  including regret  happiness  depression  optimism  self-esteem  perfectionism  neuroticism  and subjective well-being showed that not only do maximizers exhibit a different style of decision-making from satisficers  but they also appear to experience different emotional concomitants of decisions
MISC	they experience higher levels of regret and dissatisfaction than satisficers  and are less happy  more depressed and less optimistic than satisficers  citation
MISC	they are also more affected by social comparison  especially upward social comparison  than satisficers
MISC	thus  the maximizing strategy seems not only to be associated with the choice process  but also with experience after the choice has been made  perhaps including satisfaction with life as a whole
MISC	the phenomenon wherein the context of choice affects the context of experience has elsewhere been referred to as  leakage   citation
MISC	despite their relative success  however  maximizers were less satisfied with the outcomes of their job search  and more pessimistic  stressed  overwhelmed  and depressed by the job search process
MISC	in other domains  researchers have examined the impact of maximization on gift giving behavior  citation   retirement investing  citation  and post-decisional regret  citation
MISC	since the maximization scale was first published  it has been employed in numerous studies in different countries  and the maximization construct appears to be of growing interest to researchers in various domains  citation
MISC	given this increasing interest  a reexamination of the maximization scale and its measurement properties is warranted
AIMX	the current paper examines the reliability  factor structure  and validity of the maximization scale  and also proposes several refined  shorter forms of the scale
MISC	development of shorter forms of the maximization scale is important because  especially when maximization is not the focal interest of research  a short scale will allow researchers to include this construct in large  multivariate studies without making survey instruments excessively long  citation
MISC	perhaps more important  the existing maximization scale is a candidate for refinement because both past research employing the scale and the current set of analyses  reported below  suggest that the original  number -item scale contains several items that tend not to perform well psychometrically and thus should be considered for elimination
MISC	in addition  the original schwartz et al citation  study suggested that the scale could be analyzed into three distinct factors - one reflecting choice difficulty  one reflecting difficulty with large numbers of options  and one reflecting high standards
MISC	nothing has been done since to confirm the existence of these three factors
MISC	further analysis is warranted both because these factors suggest different psychological processes and because the original schwartz et al citation  results were less than ideal with respect to factor structure
MISC	the analysis below suggests that a shorter   number -item version of the maximization scale not only performs adequately  but actually performs at a level superior to the original   number -item scale
MISC	therefore future researchers are advised to examine not only peoples' maximization scores but their sub-dimension scores as well
MISC	having a shorter  yet more valid and reliable instrument with which to measure people's tendency to maximize should enhance research efforts that examine how people's tendencies to maximize or satisfice during the choice process affect their decisions and choices  and ultimately their happiness and well-being
OWNX	analysis  number  examines the internal consistency and the dimensional purity of the maximization scale using ten pre-existing datasets that included the maximization construct
MISC	furthermore  we follow the procedure recommended by smith et al citation  in order to avoid the common sins of short scale development
MISC	there were  number  pre-existing datasets  representing a total of over  number   number  respondents  which were obtained from several authors  across several disciplines  in both the u s and overseas  see table  number 
MISC	although many models for risky choices between gambles assume that information is somehow integrated  the recently proposed priority heuristic ph claims that choices are based on one piece of information only
MISC	that is  although the current reason for a choice according to the ph can vary  all other reasons are claimed to be ignored
MISC	however  the choices predicted by the ph and other pieces of information are often confounded  thus rendering critical tests of whether decisions are actually based on one reason only  impossible
MISC	the current study aims to remedy this problem by manipulating the number of reasons additionally in line with the choice implied by the ph
MISC	the results show that participants' choices and decision times depend heavily on the number of reasons in line with the ph - thus contradicting the notion of non-compensatory  one-reason decision making
MISC	the adaptive toolbox metaphor  put forward by gigerenzer and co-workers  citation   implies that decision makers possess and use a collection of simple rules of thumb - the so-called fast-and-frugal heuristics - to achieve very good results with very little effort
MISC	since it was originally formulated  the toolbox has been rapidly growing and new heuristics are introduced almost regularly
MISC	despite broder's  citation  criticism that  inventing more and more new heuristics may soon become futile if they are not seriously tested empirically  p  number  the adaptive toolbox was recently extended to preferential decisions by means of the priority heuristic  citation  - a simple lexicographic rule for choices between gambles
MISC	although the idea of adaptive decision making in choice is  in itself  not novel  citation   the ph represents a new development in this area
MISC	brandstatter et al citation  concluded that the ph outperforms both normative and other heuristic models in predicting participants choices
MISC	also  they claim that it represents a process model of choice  describing the sequence of steps taken by a decision maker's cognitive apparatus
MISC	one serious caveat to studies investigating the ph lies in the selection of gambles used  the choice predicted by the ph and the gamble favored by other pieces of information are often confounded
MISC	thus  adherence rates to the ph  or modal choices as studied by brandstatter et al citation  might be biased measures of whether participants' decisions are truly based on one reason only  as claimed by the ph
MISC	the current study aims to remedy this problem
MISC	first  the choice rule of the ph will be introduced along with a description of the problem of confounded information in gamble-pairs
MISC	consistent with previous research  more risky choices were made by respondents receiving negatively framed versions of the decision problems than by those receiving positively framed versions
MISC	however  different processes were evident for those scoring high and low on numeracy
MISC	whereas the choices of the less numerate showed a large effect of frame above and beyond any influence of their evaluations of the separate options  the choices of the highly numerate were almost completely accounted for by their attractiveness ratings of the separate options
MISC	these results are consistent with an increased tendency of the highly numerate to integrate complex numeric information in the construction of their preferences and a tendency for the less numerate to respond more superficially to non-numeric sources of information
MISC	tversky and kahneman's  citation  introduction of the asian disease problem was among the earliest examples of the malleability of human decision making
MISC	at the heart of this problem is the choice between a riskless option and a risky option of equal expected value
MISC	the sure-thing option offers a fixed riskless outcome
MISC	in the positive framing condition it is  save  number  out of  number  lives  whereas in the negative condition it is   number  will die
MISC	in response to this choice problem  the majority of decision makers choose the riskless or  sure-thing  option over the risky option when potential outcomes are framed as gains lives saved but choose the risky option over the sure-thing option when the exact same objective outcomes are framed as losses deaths
MISC	later attempts to replicate this phenomenon and extend it to other domains such as money gained or lost rather than lives did not always duplicate the literal preference reversal  but a general preference shift of more risky choices to avoid losses than to achieve gains is one of the most solid findings in judgment and decision making research  citation
MISC	later research uncovered task characteristics and individual difference factors that moderated the reliability and magnitude of the risky-choice framing effect  citation
OWNX	we asked participants in each framing condition to judge the full scenario and also to separately judge both the sure-thing component and the risky component
OWNX	in that way  we can assess the extent to which the full scenario framing effect is driven by framing of the separate components  and we can compare this for individuals differing on a variable known to be associated with more superficial vs more complex processing of numeric information in decisions
MISC	people prefer their own initials to other letters  influencing preferences in many domains
MISC	the  name letter effect   citation  may not apply to negatively valenced targets if people are motivated to downplay or distance themselves from negative targets associated with the self  as previous research has shown  citation
MISC	individuals who shared an initial with the hurricane name were overrepresented among hurricane relief donors relative to the baseline distribution of initials in the donor population
MISC	this finding suggests that people may seek to ameliorate the negative effects of a disaster when there are shared characteristics between the disaster and the self
MISC	katrina petrillo raised   number  for hurricane katrina victims by selling lemonade  citation
MISC	when asked why  she said  i realized my name is going to go down in history as one of the biggest storms ever   citation
MISC	the prediction that individuals who share an initial with a disaster will be more likely to donate to fundraising efforts targeted at that disaster is consistent with research that has demonstrated that people prefer the initial of their first name over other letters
MISC	this preference  called the name letter effect  citation   is reflected in both subjective ratings of initials  citation  and in choices of same-initial targets over comparable targets with different initials  citation
MISC	shared initials have been shown to influence choices in numerous domains including product preferences  donations to political candidates  spouses and occupations  citation
MISC	for example  one study found that people with names beginning with the letter  d  are overrepresented in the profession of dentists and people with names beginning with the letter  l  are overrepresented in the population of lawyers  citation
MISC	similarly  people named  george  are more likely to live in georgia than expected by chance and people named  louise  are more likely to live in louisiana  citation
MISC	together  these findings indicate that similarities affect judgment and choice  presumably by creating a  unit-relation   citation  that facilitates the assimilation of positive feelings of the self into the representation of the target  citation
MISC	psychologists have theoretically assumed that people should avoid associations with negative stimuli  citation
MISC	this claim is based on several studies that have shown that people  cut off reflected failure   citation  of close others in order to protect the ego
MISC	for example  people are less likely to wear clothing displaying the logos of sports teams that have recently lost a game as compared to teams that have recently won a game  citation
MISC	similarly  snyder and colleagues  citation  randomly assigned groups of college students to receive positive or negative false feedback on a group task
MISC	they found that compared to a no-feedback control  the successful group demonstrated more affiliative tendencies  while the failure group demonstrated less afilliative tendencies
MISC	under other circumstances  individuals may downplay negative features of a target with which they share a unit relationship
MISC	finch and cialdini  citation  found that subjects who believed that they shared a birthday with rasputin rated him less negatively after reading a description of his misdeeds than those who did not
MISC	in a recent study  nelson and simmons  citation  extended this work by demonstrating that pairing an initial with a negative outcome undermines task performance
MISC	specifically  they found that people whose first names begin with c and d initials have lower gpas than people with other initials and baseball players with k initials the letter used to represent strikes in baseball are more likely to strike out than players with other initials  presumably because people tend to downplay the severity of the negative outcome  much as they downplay rasputin's deeds when they think he shares their birthday
MISC	in other words  people with first names that begin with c and d may implicitly downplay the severity of getting these lower grades  and consequently dampen efforts to perform well
MISC	clearly  katrina petrillo understood the negative impact of hurricane katrina
MISC	she claimed that sharing her name with a severe storm motivated her to help its victims
MISC	if she minimized her association with the storm  it is unlikely that she would attend to the common initial and consequently would feel no more motivated to donate money than anyone else
MISC	similarly  if she downplayed the severity of the storm  it is unlikely that she would mention that it is the  worst storm in history  or invest so much time raising money
MISC	in this case  it is again unlikely that she would be so compelled to donate given previous research suggesting that people are less likely to donate to less severe disasters  citation
OWNX	katrina petrillo's efforts to raise money for the victims of hurricane katrina is contrary to both of the processes outline above  as well as to self-enhancement literature in general
MISC	citation  however  there are circumstances when people may not avoid their association with negative targets  and may even make reparations for the actions of others with whom they share an association
MISC	for example  people will endorse compensatory behavior to right the wrongs committed by their ingroup against an outgroup  citation  even if this compensatory behavior comes at a personal cost to the self
OWNX	doosje and colleagues  citation  found that this phenomena was mediated by feelings of collective guilt  suggesting that responsibility  like positive affect can transfer between members of a unit-relation
MISC	if group membership increases the likelihood of compensatory behavior for the actions of other group members  then perhaps other kinds of unit-relations can do the same
MISC	taken together  previous literatures on self-target associations allow us to speculate that katrina petrillo's sentiment towards the victims of hurricane katrina may be shared by others
MISC	shared-initials are capable of producing a unit relation and there is at least some evidence that a unit-relation with a target that inflicts harm can lead people to help their victims
MISC	this led us to expect that people would  i be more likely to donate money to same-initial disasters  and possibly ii donate more money to same initial disasters
MISC	vlaev and chater  citation  demonstrated that the cooperativeness of previously seen prisoner's dilemma games biases choices and predictions in the current game
MISC	these effects were  a assimilation to the mean cooperativeness of the played games caused by action reinforcement  and b perceptual contrast with the preceding games depending on the range and the rank order of their cooperativeness
MISC	this suggests that reinforcement learning is a powerful source of inconsistency in strategic interaction  which may not be eliminated even if the other players are unbiased and the markets are efficient
MISC	thus  an economic understanding of the various markets  of strategic interaction between firms  and indeed of the economy at large  requires understanding how people trade-off payoff and uncertainty when they interact with each other
MISC	when decisions are interactive and the outcomes depend also on the decisions of other people  the choice process has a recursive quality  each player makes decisions in the context of assumptions about the decisions of the other player  but the other player may equally choose on the basis of assumptions about the decisions of the first player
MISC	citation using experimental methods  psychologists and economists have tested how realistic are such assumptions and approximations  and have found considerable discrepancy between actual behaviour and the predictions of game theory
MISC	citation  for example  in any prisoner's dilemma pd game  the nash equilibrium is  notoriously  that both players behave uncooperatively in real life  the problem of cooperation is that it can secure mutual benefits  but  by cooperating people risk being exploited
MISC	however  many studies showed that behaviour of people playing pd game deviates systematically from theoretical predictions  i e   people cooperate more than expected  citation
MISC	there are various accounts of this behaviour  some including factors such as misunderstanding of the game  role of repetition of the play and the resulting reputation and retaliation affects  irrationality  motivation incentives  altruism  communication  and so on
MISC	citation more recently  vlaev and chater  citation  tested one of the basic assumptions in game theory that is not typically challenged in experimental work  that each game is considered separately and the resulting choice of strategy should be based only on the attributes of the current game
MISC	this study presented a psychological phenomenon  game relativity  which is an anomaly for normative theories of strategic decision-making
MISC	specifically  the reported results seem to indicate that people do not possess a well-defined notion of the utility of a strategy and the  cooperativeness  of a game in particular  and instead  people's perceived utility for a strategy appears highly context-sensitive and it depends on the other recently played games
MISC	vlaev and chater's  citation  experiments were based on research on fundamental cognitive processes in psychophysics  which are related to perception and representation of sensory magnitudes such as loudness  brightness  or weight
MISC	note that in judging the utility of decision strategies in games  people must assess the magnitudes of risk and return that are associated with each strategy
MISC	in this respect  stewart  chater  stott  and reimers  citation  had earlier argued that some of the factors that determine how people assess these magnitudes might be similar to factors underlying assessment of psychophysical magnitudes
CONT	there is substantial evidence that people are poor at providing stable absolute judgments of such magnitudes and are heavily influenced by the other options presented to them in the recent past or available at the time of choice
MISC	citation  such context effects are consistent with people making perceptual judgments on the basis of relative magnitude information  rather than absolute magnitude information
MISC	citation applying these ideas to strategic decision making in pd games  if the representation of the cooperativeness of a game is also similar to the representation of these simple perceptual dimensions i e   similar underlying cognitive processes are involved  then preceding material might be expected to influence current judgments and decisions in games  as it does in the perceptual case
MISC	vlaev and chater  citation  tested whether the game's attributes like  cooperativeness   measured by rapoport and chammah's  citation  cooperation index ci  behave like those of perceptual stimuli  and they found similar context effects
OWNX	here we provide a brief summary of these experiments  which are essential background for understanding the argument behind the follow-up study presented in this article
MISC	experiment  number  tested helson's  citation  adaptation-level theory
MISC	this fits with reinforcement accounts of game playing  including pd  citation   which predict that more cooperative games on average would lead to more cooperative feedback that reinforces each player to cooperate more across all games
MISC	in other words  the mean reinforcement may have caused the observed assimilation effects
MISC	the range of presented games produced a contrast effect so that that games that were further from the minimum ci value in the sequence were perceived as more  cooperative
MISC	thus  the results from experiments  number  and  number  supported the predictions about perceptual contrast  in line with the range frequency theory  citation   according to which the neutral point of the judgment scale did not correspond to the mean of the contextual events but rather to a compromise between the midpoint defined by the range of the distribution and the median
MISC	for example  satisfaction judgments would be different in two distributions of experiences that have different skew of their intensities or quality levels and hence will have different rank orders for these stimuli even if the means of the two distributions are the same
OWNX	one is related to perception  and in particular  the representation of perceptual magnitudes  as we discussed earlier
MISC	the second fundamental mechanism is related to response action generation  because agents tend to repeat actions e g   c or d according to the average degree of reinforcement with which each action is associated i e   the utility for the agent of the outcome of the game reinforces the chosen strategy
MISC	from a psychological point of view  reinforcement corresponds to following thorndike's  citation  classic law of effect - repeating behaviours to degree that they are followed by positive outcomes  and stamping out behaviours to the degree that they are followed by negative outcomes
MISC	for example  in the context of pd  a reinforcement learner will follow the strategy that brings higher payoff without logical thinking about the strategic structure of the game in other words  reinforcement learner follows the more rewarding choice instead of inferring the dominant strategy  citation
MISC	none of the existing studies  however  have investigated whether these context effects also hold when playing against a consistent opponent
OWNX	here we do not mean a  rational  opponent who should permanently defect in pd
OWNX	by a consistent player  we mean a player whose responses are completely determined by the current game  and not influenced either by the structure of previous games  or the history of past responses
MISC	thus  such player is consistent across contexts
MISC	because consistent players are uninfluenced by context  they may potentially act to  damp down   rather than amplify  contextual effects on the experimental participant - which may arise if both human participants are influenced by the same contextual factors  hence potentially creating a  bubble  of over- and under-cooperating due to the perceptual or response biases
OWNX	in our study  the consistent player was a computer algorithm  not a human participant the participants were told this  although the algorithm is not specified
MISC	the most psychologically natural model of the consistent player assumes that the probability of cooperation depends on the  cooperativeness  of the game  which is negatively related to the incentive for each player to defect  and also negatively related to the  damage  done to the other player  if one defects
OWNX	here we use the cooperation index ci which provides a good measure of the typical level of cooperation observed experimentally in pd games  citation
MISC	in other words  it is good to be cooperative when the situation permits as both players would be better off  if both cooperate  citation   but being over-cooperative gives additional incentive to other less cooperative players to exploit you
MISC	  in this setting  the computer was pre-programmed to cooperate with a frequency probability reflecting the values of the ci of each game
MISC	for example  the computer was programmed to cooperate  number  percent  of the time when playing games with index   number 
MISC	an alternative design would be to program the computer to respond randomly i e   to cooperate  number  percent  of the time
MISC	however  such a design would not be as powerful evidence about the strength of the biases under question  because the computer generated feedback is more ambiguous about the cooperativeness of the various games cis
MISC	thus  players will receive a weaker feedback signal when the games are less or more cooperative  and various biases are more likely to thrive in such an ambiguous environment
MISC	on the other side  the policy of cooperating according to ci gives less freedom of interpretation about the cooperativeness of the various games
MISC	actually  if the game is seen as repeated  then that should make the effect of the consistent opponent even stronger  which should  in turn  further weaken the context effects  because the players would be more likely to reciprocate their consistent opponent
OWNX	to accomplish our research objective  we replicated the design of the three experiments described by vlaev and chater  citation
OWNX	here we present the three studies together for brevity of exposition
MISC	using brunswik's  citation  lens model framework  hammond  citation  proposed interpersonal conflict theory to explain the nature  source  and resolution of disagreement or  cognitive conflict  between parties performing judgment tasks
MISC	an early review by brehmer  citation  highlighted the potential of this approach in  for example  understanding the structure of cognitive conflicts  and the effect of task and person variables on judgment policy change and conflict resolution
OWNX	however  our bibliographic and content reviews from  number  to the present day demonstrate that research on cognitive conflict using the lens model has declined sharply  while research on  task conflict  has grown dramatically
MISC	there has also been a shift to less theoretical precision and methodological rigor
MISC	it was during the cognitive revolution in psychology and the cold war period in political history when hammond  citation  proposed that conflicts between parties performing judgment tasks could be viewed as purely cognitive  thus making it unnecessary to examine the motivations and values of conflicting parties as social psychologists might do
MISC	in interpersonal conflict ipc theory  hammond  citation  outlined how this cognitive conflict could be construed within brunswik's  citation  lens model framework  as well as the experimental methods that researchers could use to study the nature  source  and resolution of disagreement between parties performing judgment tasks
MISC	briefly  cognitive conflict represents differences in how parties conceptualize the solution to a problem
MISC	for instance  different parties may have different policies for solving a judgment problem in terms of the information they rely on
MISC	inconsistency in how parties apply their judgment policies can also lead to disagreement
MISC	thus  according to ipc theory  parties striving to make a joint judgment on the same task could conflict because they disagree in principle in that they have different policies for how to solve the problem and or in practice in that they are inconsistent in the application of their policies
MISC	importantly  while cognitive conflict is different from conflict caused by motivational and value differences among parties  cognitive differences can evolve into motivational and value-laden conflicts
MISC	under these circumstances  the underlying cognitive differences can be very difficult to detect and resolve
MISC	despite this  since that time  ipc theory appears to have featured little in the growing field of judgment and decision making jdm
MISC	for example  in a historical review of theories in the field  goldstein and hogarth  citation  provide only a passing mention of ipc theory when considering developments in judgment research
MISC	the need for conflict theories  including cognitive conflict  seems apparent in an era characterized by international terrorism where  amongst other things  parties disagree about the level of threat  and how to manage and minimize it  citation   and in an era characterized by a movement towards greater use of alternative dispute resolution
MISC	in fact  today  a theory of cognitive conflict could benefit from recent theoretical and methodological advances in the field of jdm
MISC	for instance  jdm researchers have shown that individuals are likely to use simple process models when performing judgment tasks  citation   and that non-cognitive factors such as emotions may affect how individuals make judgments  citation
MISC	in addition  researchers have employed new tools such as virtual environments and computer simulations when studying judgment behavior  citation
OWNX	our goal is to evaluate the evolution of ipc theory from its inception to the present day
OWNX	our goal is modest in that we focus our efforts on cognitive conflict as it directly emerged from the ipc paradigm and related lens model framework
OWNX	second  from  number  to the present day  we trace the evolution of ipc theory and cognitive conflict research by conducting bibliographic and content reviews of publications that cite central articles by hammond  number  and brehmer  number 
OWNX	finally  we discuss the future of ipc theory and cognitive conflict research by considering opportunities for theoretical advancement and methodological innovation offered currently in the field of jdm
OWNX	we hope these will inspire future researchers
MISC	people tend to overestimate emotional responses to future events
MISC	this study examined whether such affective forecasting errors occur for feelings of regret  as measured by self-report and subsequent decision-making
MISC	some participants played a pricing game and lost by a narrow or wide margin  while others were asked to imagine losing by such margins
MISC	participants who experienced a narrow loss reported more regret than those who imagined a narrow loss
MISC	furthermore  those experiencing a narrow loss behaved more cautiously in a subsequent gambling task
MISC	thus  the study provides self-report and behavioral evidence for a reversal of the affective forecasting phenomenon for feelings of regret
MISC	people want to be happy  when confronted with a decision  they'd rather choose the path to joy than the path to misery
MISC	if only it were that simple
MISC	you can guess that getting tenure will make you happy  but the elation will dissipate faster than you would imagine
MISC	finally  some participants are asked to predict how happy they would feel after receiving a particular outcome  while others are told the outcome first and then are asked to report the happiness they experience
MISC	this allows researchers to measure the extent to which anticipated and experienced feelings depart from the baseline level of happiness reported at the beginning of the session
MISC	for example  when asked to imagine how they would feel  number  minutes after losing money in a gambling task  people predict more unhappiness than the unhappiness they experience  number  minutes after actually losing  citation
MISC	people also overestimate the intensity of their initial reaction  citation
MISC	considerable evidence has accumulated over the last  number  years in support of the basic finding that people overestimate the impact that future events will have on their emotional response  citation
MISC	most of these studies have equated emotional response with changes in valence
MISC	for example  some studies have asked participants to report their happiness on a scale ranging from not happy to very happy
MISC	other studies have asked participants to report the intensity of several different emotions and those reports were later converted into composites scores of positive and negative valence  citation
MISC	this emphasis on the pleasant unpleasant dimension has proved useful for the study of affective forecasting
OWNX	we know that people are relatively skilled at predicting which specific emotions e g   anger  fear  disgust  etc
MISC	they will experience in different situations  citation
OWNX	we know less about how accurate people are at predicting the intensity and duration of those specific emotions
MISC	a few studies have started to examine this question particularly for the feeling of regret
OWNX	the current study is another step in that direction
MISC	thus  regret is unique among emotions in its reliance on counterfactual thinking   if i had chosen differently  then things would have turned out better
MISC	  when counterfactuals are readily available  regret seems to grow more intense
MISC	for example  people's intuition is that poor choices are most regretful when they are unusual choices  in those cases  the conventional approach is readily available as a counterfactual
MISC	for a similar reason  people believe that they will experience more regret when the desired outcome is narrowly missed than when it is missed by a wide margin
MISC	presumably  a loss by a narrow margin highlights the unfulfilled success  citation
MISC	as a consequence  people believe that missing a flight by  number  minutes should cause more regret than missing it by an hour
MISC	psychologists have shared that same intuition for over  number  years  citation
MISC	the intuition that narrow margins of loss are highly effective at triggering regret has been challenged by a recent study on affective forecasting  citation
MISC	in a naturalistic setting  people who missed the subway by a narrow margin reported no more regret than those who missed it by a wide margin
MISC	the finding was replicated in an experimental setting
MISC	participants had to create two arrangements that exemplified their two best guesses  and then proceeded to choose the best one for an opportunity to win a prize
MISC	some participants were asked to predict how much regret they would feel if they were to find out that the correct arrangement was the one they did not choose a narrow margin of loss
MISC	this condition aimed to experimentally recreate the situation in which a participant is asked to imagine having narrowly missed a desired outcome e g   catching the subway
MISC	participants' predictions in this condition were compared to the actual feelings of regret  as reported by participants who actually experienced a narrow margin of loss
MISC	as hypothesized by the authors of the study  participants predicted they would feel more regret after losing by a narrow margin  but in reality they did not
MISC	in other words  there was an asymmetry between the amount of regret anticipated and the amount of regret experienced
MISC	at the same time  some aspects of the experimental design cast doubt on the generalizability of the findings
MISC	in particular  participants in gilbert et al 's  citation  study were offered a consolation prize after being told they had lost
MISC	this small prize may have helped participants to re-conceptualize the loss as a minor win  thus reducing the amount of regret experienced
MISC	in fact  previous research shows that people recover most quickly from negative events when it is easier for them to rationalize the outcome to their favor  citation
MISC	thus  the absence of a consolation prize might lead to a very different pattern of results  one in which the experience of regret is stronger than anticipated
OWNX	our study tested this hypothesis
MISC	another limitation of the  number  study by gilbert et al is its reliance on a self-report measure
MISC	while this approach has been validated for basic emotions such as happiness  its use for assessing more complex emotions such as regret is a matter of debate
MISC	asking people directly to report how much regret they are feeling assumes that people can easily associate their feelings with the verbal label
MISC	although some researchers claim this is indeed possible  citation   others argue that such direct questioning fails to discriminate regret from other negative emotions such as disappointment  citation
MISC	furthermore  self-report measures are subject to possible carry-over effects when the same emotion is probed twice  as is often the case in studies of affective forecasting
MISC	one way to overcome the limitations of self-report measures is to explore the influence that regret has on future behavior
MISC	some researchers have argued that emotions in general  and regret in particular  exist for the sake of guiding behaviors  citation
MISC	many of the choices people make aim to minimize the experience of regret  and anticipation of regret serves to deter risk taking  citation
MISC	thus  by measuring risky behavior after a narrow loss it should be possible for us to assess whether experiencing or imagining the narrow loss is more effective in triggering the emotion
OWNX	we explored this possibility with a variant of a gambling task first introduced by slovic  citation   which our participants completed after participating in the price is right task
MISC	participants viewed ten cards face down on a computer screen with the instructions that nine of the cards were good i e   selecting any of them would earn the participant a dollar per card  but one of the cards was a disaster card i e   choosing it would cause the loss of every dollar collected up to that point and end the game
MISC	after turning the initial number of cards  participants made a second and more important decision
MISC	they had to decide whether to stop and walk away with the money or continue and pick one more card for the chance to win another dollar
MISC	thus  the opportunity of winning a relatively small prize was pitted against the risk of losing a larger amount i e   a regret prone situation
MISC	in study  number    number  participants performed experience-based decision tasks either alone or in pairs  with the two members being exposed to each others' choices and outcomes
MISC	the tasks involved either equiprobable gains and losses or frequent small gains and rare large losses
MISC	the results indicated that  in both risk types  the social exposure increased the proportion of risky selection  but its effect was stronger in the rare-loss condition
MISC	the results showed that observing others  rather than being observed  led to the pattern of increased risk taking
MISC	the findings of the two studies indicate the importance of distinguishing different types of risky situations and shed light on contradictory findings in the literature
MISC	the effect of the social environment on individual decision making is important because many naturally occurring individual behaviors are conducted in the presence of others
MISC	this area of investigation is often studied in the field of social learning  citation  which is focused on situations in which individuals have the opportunity to learn from others' experience
MISC	studies in this field tend to address situations where actions differ in their objective value but this information is not shared among all individuals
MISC	therefore  observing others' behavior adds important information about the  right  action to follow
MISC	hardly any empirical research in this field has focused on the interesting problem where the main difference between alternatives is their associated risk or variance
MISC	another field of study relevant to the current context is the study of group behavior  in which groups are typically asked to reach a consensus
MISC	studies of group behavior have addressed the question of social influence on risk taking
MISC	the main finding in this line of research is that groups tend to hold more extreme risk attitudes than those of their individual members
MISC	this finding is typically referred to as the group polarization or groupthink phenomenon  citation
MISC	the research conducted has yielded mixed results
MISC	blank  citation  found that in a repeated choice task exposing three individuals to each others' outcomes facilitated risk taking  compared to choices made alone  citation
MISC	conversely  blaskovitch  veach  and ginsburg  citation  in an experimental game of blackjack found no effect of social exposure  citation
MISC	mixed findings also appear in relevant applied studies
MISC	the presence of co-acting individuals was found to increase risky street crossing in a computerized task but only for adolescents and not for adults  citation  yet it facilitated more risky crossing in field studies  citation
MISC	still  these mixed findings are usually ignored and this research area is often briefly discussed as an extension of the group polarization phenomenon observed in consensual decisions  citation
MISC	the goal of the current study is to clarify the effect of social exposure in two types of risk taking situations involving losses
MISC	one type comprises cases in which gains and losses are equally likely
MISC	the other type involves asymmetry in the likelihood and magnitude of gains and losses  particularly that comprising typical small gains and rare large losses
MISC	a robust behavioral regularity in experience-based decision making is that  when expected values are similar  people choose according to the alternative that produces the best outcomes most of the time  citation
MISC	accordingly  people are more likely to select risky alternatives producing rare losses and typical gains than those producing equiprobable gains and losses  a phenomenon which is indeed widely observed  citation
MISC	yet note that the same principle predicts that  when a risky alternative produces rare losses  information concerning others' behavior would increase risk taking
MISC	in this situation  others' choice outcomes increase the salience of or the awareness to the differences between the typical favorable outcome from the risky alternative and the typically unfavorable outcome from the safe alternative
MISC	the task is repeated  and payoffs are contingent on the option chosen
MISC	if an individual has decided to stop selecting r  then he she is no longer supplied with additional evidence that the obtained outcome from s   number  is worse than r's   number  most of the time
MISC	in a social situation however  others who take risk and pick r are naturally continuing to transmit this information to the decision maker  and are thus likely to increase the level of risk taking
OWNX	results consistent with this hypothesis were reported in studies that examined the effect of obtaining feedback from unselected choice alternatives i e   foregone payoffs compared to obtaining feedback from selected ones only
MISC	in decision tasks with a risky alternative producing rare negative outcomes and common favorable outcomes  individuals provided with foregone payoffs are continually presented with the favorable outcomes of this alternative
MISC	indeed  foregone payoffs increase the level of risk taking in such tasks  citation
MISC	however  this effect has not been observed for risky alternatives producing equally likely gains and losses  such as betting on a color in a roulette wheel  citation
MISC	the latter pattern is explained by the fact that  when a risky alternative is equally likely to produce gains and losses  then its outcomes are not better most of the time  and adding foregone payoffs does not change that fact
MISC	study  number  evaluated the effect of mutual exposure to other people's choices in decision tasks involving rare or equiprobable losses
MISC	the results showed that  while social exposure increased risk taking in both decision tasks  it had a larger effect in the rare loss condition
MISC	the principle of loss aversion is thought to explain a wide range of anomalous phenomena involving tradeoffs between losses and gains
MISC	in this article  i show that the anomalies loss aversion was introduced to explainthe risky bet premium  the endowment effect  and the status-quo biasare characterized not only by a loss gain tradeoff  but by a tradeoff between the status-quo and change  and  that a propensity towards the status-quo in the latter tradeoff is sufficient to explain these phenomena
MISC	moreover  i show that two basic psychological principles number  that motives drive behavior  and  number  that preferences tend to be fuzzy and ill-definedimply the existence of a robust and fundamental propensity of this sort
MISC	thus  a loss aversion principle is rendered superfluous to an account of the phenomena it was introduced to explain
MISC	research has shown that people tend to evaluate outcomes not  in terms of their impact on an individual's resulting state of  wealth  but in terms of changes from a reference state  citation
MISC	moreover  evidence has been interpreted  to imply that people are loss averse  negative changes i e    losses from a reference state are thought to loom larger than  positive changes i e   gains of equivalent magnitude  citation
MISC	this principle   named loss aversion  is commonly considered the most robust and  important finding of behavioral decision theory  and has been  widely hailed  citation  and cited as a  seemingly ubiquitous  phenomenon   citation
MISC	this seeming ubiquity is evident in the economics and finance  literature  where loss aversion has been cited  inter alia  to  account for the equity premium puzzle  citation    the disposition effect  citation   and the inability of risk-aversion  based on wealth to explain people's unwillingness to accept small  even bets  citation
MISC	in the marketing literature   loss aversion has similarly been cited widely to account  inter  alia  for the endowment effect  citation   the compromise effect  citation   and an observed asymmetry in the price elasticity of demand   citation
MISC	the principle of loss aversion was first introduced by kahneman and tversky  citation  to account for the finding that experimental subjects required a premium over expected value to accept a bet offering an even chance of a gain or loss  the risky   bet premium 
MISC	subsequently  the principle was extended to the context of riskless choice  thaler  citation  coined the term  endowment effect  to refer to the finding that randomly assigned owners of an object appear to value the object more than randomly assigned non-owners of the object
MISC	for instance  in one well-known series of endowment effect experiments  kahneman  knetsch and thaler  citation  found that randomly assigned owners of a mug required significantly more money to part with their possession around   number  than randomly assigned buyers were willing to pay to acquire it around   number 
MISC	kahneman et al citation  and tversky and kahneman  citation  attributed this result to loss aversion  owners' loss of the mug loomed larger than buyers' gain of the mug
MISC	 the status   quo bias individuals' tendency to prefer to remain at the status-quois similarly attributed to loss aversion  it is assumed that the loss of the status-quo option looms larger than the gain of an alternative option  citation
MISC	remarkably for a principle that is so pervasive  the principle  of loss aversion is not derived from any theory of behavior or  more basic psychological principles  but is an ad hoc principle  introduced to account for a range of phenomena involving tradeoffs  between losses and gains that are anomalous in the context of  the classical choice paradigm
MISC	the absence of an accepted psychological  theory to account for loss aversion has led to a paradoxical  situation  loss aversion is cited as the explanation for phenomena  associated with loss gain tradeoffs e g   the endowment effect   status-quo bias  risky bet premium and  circuitously  the  same phenomena are cited as evidence for the existence of loss  aversion
MISC	indeed  a number of researchers have attempted to uncover an underlying psychological mechanism that could explain a loss gain asymmetry
MISC	posited psychological mechanisms for loss aversion include the proposition that the hedonic impact of losses is greater than that of gains  citation   that people's locus of attention tends to be focused on losses more than on gains  citation   andthrough studies with either animals or fmrithat a loss gain asymmetry is cognitively hard-wired
MISC	a common feature of these attempts to uncover a psychological  mechanism for loss aversion is the premise that a fundamental  loss gain asymmetry in fact exists  and that this asymmetry is  reflected in the phenomena it purports to explain
MISC	in particular  i recognize that the phenomena most commonly  cited as evidence for loss aversionthe status-quo bias  the  endowment effect  and the risky bet premiumare characterized  not only by a loss gain tradeoff  but by a tradeoff between the  status-quo and change  and  that a propensity towards the status  quo in the latter tradeoff is sufficient to explain these phenomena
MISC	moreover  i show that two basic psychological principles number   that motives drive behavior  and  number  that preferences tend to  be fuzzy and ill-definedimply the existence of a robust and  fundamental propensity of this sort
MISC	i conclude with the argument that the existence of a  basic behavioral tendency to favor the status-quo over change  renders the loss aversion principle superfluous to an account  of the phenomena it was introduced to explain  and that the principle  should therefore be abandoned
OWNX	  we hypothesize that the duration of exposure to an item will foster increased pre-ownership attachment to an item and increased valuations in a manner similar to duration of actual ownership
OWNX	to induce different levels of exposure  we varied the amount of time that participants examined the auctioned item i e   coffee mugs prior to participating in real dollar auctions
MISC	in the first study  participants bid in online english open bid auctions
MISC	ownership of an item has been shown to increase the owner's valuation  a phenomenon termed the  endowment effect
MISC	  the most widely-held explanation of the endowment effect is that it is a manifestation of the asymmetry of value that kahneman and tversky  citation  call loss aversion  based on the observation that loss has a greater subjective effect than does an equivalent gain
MISC	extant literature suggests that endowment affects monetary valuations from the moment an individual gains factual ownership of an item
MISC	for this reason  kahneman  knetsch  and thaler  citation  used the term  instant  endowment effect
MISC	strahilevitz and loewenstein  citation  extended this notion  suggesting that  although adaptation of ownership begins immediately following endowment  complete adaptation to ownership is likely to take time
MISC	strahilevitz and loewenstein suggested that adaptation of ownership need not be all-or-nothing  because individuals may not adapt instantaneously and fully to either the acquisition or loss of an item
MISC	however  several recent studies suggested that the endowment effect may affect valuations even sooner  i e   before actual ownership takes place  citation
MISC	for example  casey  citation  discovered a gap between participants' compensation demanded and their willingness to pay for lottery tickets even in the absence of actual ownership
MISC	likewise  sen and johnson  citation  found that merely possessing a coupon for a product increased a consumer's preference for that product in a manner similar to ownership
MISC	carmon et al citation  showed that simply thinking about an option created a sense of pre-factual ownership of the option and an increased sense of loss after choosing an alternative option
MISC	hoch and loewenstein  citation  suggested that a change in an individual's reference point accompanies partial ownership of a good
MISC	they note that after partially adapting to the possession of a good  consumers may feel deprived if they are subsequently unable to fully acquire the item
MISC	as a result  hoch and loewenstein suggested that a consumer who partially adapts to ownership of a good may have increased motivation to acquire the item
MISC	related experimental work  citation  has found that the duration of auction participation operationalized in terms of the number of rounds in which a bidder was allowed to participate can affect a bidder's valuation of the auctioned item
OWNX	to accomplish this  we performed two variations of the classic mug experiment
OWNX	to induce different levels of exposure  we varied the amount of time that participants examined the mugs before placing their bids
MISC	in the second study  participants bid in online english open bid auctions
MISC	data from both studies suggest that duration of exposure affects valuations in a manner similar to duration of ownership  that is  examining an item for longer periods of time resulted in greater attachment to the item and thus higher valuations
OWNX	we therefore show that the effects observed in strahilevitz and loewenstein's  citation  study do not appear to rely on factual ownership per se  but were the result of increased subjective feeling of ownership pseudo-endowment induced by increased duration of physical possession of an object
MISC	previous research has demonstrated that bayesian reasoning performance is improved if uncertainty information is presented as natural frequencies rather than single-event probabilities
MISC	a questionnaire study of  number  college students replicated this effect but also found that the performance-boosting benefits of the natural frequency presentation occurred primarily for participants who scored high in numeracy
MISC	this finding suggests that even comprehension and manipulation of natural frequencies requires a certain threshold of numeracy abilities  and that the beneficial effects of natural frequency presentation may not be as general as previously believed
MISC	bayesian reasoning performance can be improved if uncertainty information is presented as natural frequencies
MISC	gigerenzer and hoffrage  citation  argue that  an evolutionary point of view suggests that the mind is tuned to frequency formats  which is the information format humans encountered long before the advent of probability theory
MISC	  although there is some disagreement among researchers about the reason why natural frequency presentations facilitate bayesian reasoning  citation   the result that they do improve performance is well established
AIMX	in the current paper we examine whether the natural frequency presentation facilitates bayesian reasoning among some people more than others
MISC	one result that suggests that it does is a study by bramwell  west  and salmon  citation
OWNX	they presented a bayesian pregnancy screening scenario to obstetricians  midwives  pregnant women  and the women's companions
OWNX	participants were told the base rate of a birth defect and the hit rate and false alarm rate of a prenatal test
MISC	accurate responses were more frequent when the scenario was presented in terms of natural frequencies rather than probabilities
MISC	interestingly  this effect of presentation format was limited to the obstetricians
MISC	for the other three groups  performance was equally poor for both presentation formats
MISC	thus  the facilitative effect of the natural frequency format does not appear to be universal
MISC	natural frequencies benefit only some types of reasoners
MISC	numeracy skill  defined as  the ability to process basic probability and numerical concepts   citation   has been studied in association with a number of decision tasks because many judgments and decisions rely heavily on mathematical concepts  citation
MISC	for example  gurmankin  baron  and armstrong  citation  found that more numerate people are more trusting of and more comfortable with a physician's risk communication when it includes a numeric statement of risk than when it does not  whereas less numerate people are more trusting if given non-numeric risk statements
MISC	peters et al citation  found that  compared to their counterparts  highly numerate individuals are more likely to retrieve and use appropriate numerical principles  thus making themselves less susceptible to framing effects in tasks involving numbers
MISC	it is of interest to explore whether high numerates benefit more than low numerates from uncertainty information that is presented as natural frequencies rather than single-event probabilities
MISC	for each participant  one problem was presented in a probability format and the other in a natural frequency format
MISC	the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of perceived time pressure on a learning-based task called the iowa gambling task igt
MISC	one hundred and sixty-three participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups
MISC	the control group was informed that the time allotted was typically sufficient to learn and successfully complete the task
MISC	both groups completed the igt and performance was recorded
MISC	research shows that real time constraints adversely influence igt performance  citation
MISC	there remains a need  however  to determine how perceived time pressure affects igt decision-making
MISC	in essence  is igt performance impaired by real time constraints or simply the perception of time constraints
MISC	research has shown that people perceive themselves as less biased than others  and as better than average in many favorable characteristics
OWNX	we suggest that these types of biased perceptions regarding intentions and behavior of others may directly affect people's decisions
OWNX	  we demonstrate that these perceptions are naive and unrealistic by showing that decisions from both self and others' perspectives are equally biased
MISC	research on judgment and decision making in recent decades shows that  because of cognitive and motivational biases  individuals consistently rate themselves above average across a variety of domains  such as positive traits  citation  and behavior  citation
MISC	this bias is known as the  better than average  bta effect
MISC	for example  kruger and dunning  citation  found that participants' self-rating of their ability to judge humor and solve logic and grammar problems was higher than average
MISC	they show that this tendency is stronger among those who perform more poorly
MISC	in these studies  people typically compare their characteristics  behaviors or performance with the norm  standard  or the average standing of their reference group
MISC	the bta bias is greater when the comparable target is abstract such as the average student and declines when the target is individuated  citation
MISC	the bta bias is also salient in people's evaluations of judgments  people believe their own judgments to be less susceptible to biases than the judgments of others  citation
MISC	they tend to view their own decisions as relying on objective cues in the environment  while other's judgments are influenced more by subjective and self-serving features  citation
MISC	the  naive realism  idea  citation  suggests that people assume that their own views  ideas and perceptions reflect the  truth  or the  real world   and  when others do not share their views  they tend to conclude that the others' views were subject to bias and misperceptions
MISC	although the bta bias may serve the individual by enhancing self esteem  citation   it may have a negative effect on decisions when the decision depends on belief about others' behavior
MISC	for example  believing mistakenly that other people won't donate to a certain cause might increase my willingness to donate even when i can't afford it
MISC	the perceptions of what other people view as the best way to act may influence decisions  especially when these involve public issues
MISC	the public  as well as public decision-makers  are prone to the same biases
MISC	in contrast to private decisions  decisions regarding public policy often taken by politicians and civil servants affect thousands of individuals
MISC	the cost of bad decisions  because of biased perception of citizens' behavior  attitudes or opinions might be very high
MISC	moreover  as public decision-makers and politicians depend strongly on public support  one of their main concerns when making a decision is public opinion and how their decision will be judged by most people
MISC	biased perceptions of public opinion  preferences and choices may thus negatively affect the behavior of individuals and of public decision-makers
MISC	one domain in which the perceptions of others' behavior and judgments may have a critical influence on one's own decisions is the decision to act or intervene in situations when help is needed
MISC	individuals are often exposed to situations in which their personal help is needed directly or indirectly
MISC	policy makers often consider policies that require the cooperation or help of the public
MISC	the self-other comparison has not been studied in this domain  although it is most likely that people's judgments and decisions concerning helping behavior are affected by their perceptions of others
MISC	literature on helping-behavior and bystander intervention emphasizes that other people's behavior in a given situation has considerable influence on one's own decision whether or not to intervene
MISC	not only are people concerned about the opinion of others  citation   other people's behavior may also serve as information regarding the appropriate  or right  thing to do  citation
MISC	for example  when a person monitors the reactions of others in a situation where help is needed  s he may conclude  from the others' lack of initiative  that everyone believes that intervention is not critical and thus not needed
MISC	the person adopts what s he thinks is the norm of behavior
MISC	perceptions regarding others' opinions and behaviors can be accurate or biased
MISC	individuals may misperceive their social groups or larger social environments in a number of ways that influence their behavior
MISC	 pluralistic ignorance  is one of the most common misperceptions
MISC	it occurs when a majority of individuals falsely assumes that most of their peers behave or think differently from them  when  in fact  their attitudes and or behavior are similar  citation
MISC	pluralistic ignorance was suggested as one explanation of the  bystander effect   individuals are less likely to offer help when other people are present than when alone  citation
MISC	pluralistic ignorance may thus cause lack of intervention in a case when help is needed  demonstrating how other people's opinions or behavior may have a direct influence on the decision to act or not to act
MISC	another explanation for the bystander effect is known as  diffusion of responsibility
MISC	  by this account  lack of intervention is at least partially caused by the belief that some people will act and thus one's own action is less necessary  citation
MISC	other people's behavior may have a greater influence on one's own decisions in situations that are more ambiguous or unfamiliar  citation
MISC	recent research indicates that the idea of how other people would act may influence decisions even without the physical presence of others
MISC	blair  thompson   and  wuensch  citation  demonstrated that the diffusion-of-responsibility phenomenon extends beyond face-to-face environments  the virtual presence of many others significantly reduced e-mail responsiveness to a request for help
MISC	both explanations for the bystander effect are based on the assumption that people have specific beliefs about the perceptions of others  though there has been no direct effort to test these assumptions
OWNX	in the present experiment  we directly test the self-perceptions of participants as well as their perceptions of others in the context of helping behavior
MISC	most people perceive helping others as a desirable behavior and altruism as a superior characteristic
MISC	thus  according to the bta effect  people are expected to perceive themselves as more willing to help than the average person
MISC	two biases have recently been studied in that context  the proportion dominance pd bias and the identifiable victim idv effect
MISC	do people perceive themselves as less susceptible than others to those two
MISC	with regard to proportion dominance  studies have shown that people prefer a risk-reducing intervention policy that maximizes relative life-saving saving a larger proportion of the population at the expense of absolute life-saving saving more lives  citation
MISC	this preference is incompatible with a normative model according to which the value of a single life should be the same regardless of the size of the reference group  citation
MISC	with regard to the identified victim effect  people are more willing to help identified victims victims about whom they have some  even if only minimal  information than unidentified ones  citation
MISC	the naive belief about others  as opposed to oneself may cause decision-makers to choose an alternative of action which is not to the best of their interest when the behavior  perceptions or attitudes of others is a relevant consideration as often happens in decisions concerning public policy
OWNX	in two studies on mobile phone purchase decisions  we investigated consumers' decision strategies with a newly developed process tracing tool called interactive process tracing iapt
MISC	the choices made by the identified strategies correctly predicted the observed choices in  number  percent  experiment  number  and  number  percent  experiment  number  of the cases
OWNX	moreover  in experiment  number  we directly compared mouselab and eye tracking with respect to their impact on information search and strategy description
OWNX	we found only minor differences between these two methods
OWNX	we conclude that iapt is a useful research tool to identify choice strategies  and that using eye tracking technology did not increase its validity beyond that gained with mouselab
MISC	identifying the processes that underlie judgment and decision making has been of great interest to researchers for several decades already
MISC	in this context  two major paradigms have been used  structural modeling and process tracing  citation
MISC	structural modeling aims to uncover psychological processes by relating the provided information to the decisions or judgments  typically via multiple linear regression analysis
MISC	the parameters in these models are thought to represent important features of participants' decision strategies  for instance  if a particular attribute receives a high weight in a regression equation it is interpreted as being very important for the decision maker
MISC	despite its popularity  this approach has been criticized for ignoring the predecisional phase  that is  the processes that take place between stimulus presentation and final decision
MISC	for example  svenson  citation  concluded that it is  gradually becoming clear that human decision making cannot be understood simply by studying final decisions  p  number  and  similarly  payne  braunstein  and carroll  citation  argued that the  input-output analyses that have been used in most decision research are not fully adequate to develop and test process models of decision behavior  p  number 
MISC	as a response to these and other objections against structural modeling  citation   payne  citation  and others developed the process tracing approach by adapting methods from research on human problem solving  citation
MISC	as opposed to structural modeling  the aim of process tracing is to directly describe the processes taking place during the predecisional phase
MISC	to achieve this  the participants' information search and integration is closely observed while they work on the decision task
MISC	frequently used methods within this paradigm are information boards  citation   verbal protocols  citation   the recording of eye movements  citation   and the method of active information search  citation
OWNX	in the following  we briefly describe these process tracing methodologies and discuss their strengths and weaknesses
OWNX	we then present a new tool called interactive process tracing iapt  which we developed to identify the decision processes underlying preferential choice
MISC	iapt uses various elements of the process tracing measures mentioned above to combine their strengths and simultaneously overcome some of their weaknesses
OWNX	we subsequently describe two experiments in which we successfully applied iapt to identify participants' decision strategies
MISC	despite vigorous research on risk communication  little is known about the social forces that drive these choices
MISC	erev  wallsten   and  neal  citation  showed that forecasters learn to select verbal or numerical probability estimates as a function of which mode yields on average the larger group payoffs
OWNX	we extend the result by investigating the effect of group size on the speed with which forecasters converge on the better communication mode
MISC	to test whether social loafing rather than social facilitation was mediating the effects  experiment  number  compared social to personal feedback holding group size constant at  number  members
MISC	the focus of this research is to understand some of the factors that affect how forecasters choose to communicate risk information to others in their groups
OWNX	we build on this research to investigate the effects of some non-economic  but socially important variables on the use of probabilistic estimates  specifically the effect of group size and ease of social comparison
MISC	erev et al citation  designed an experiment inspired by the tragedy of the commons  citation   in which individuals acting in their own self-interest collectively hurt or destroy their society
MISC	erev et al citation  asked whether forecasters would select language that induced heterogeneous or homogeneous behavior by decision makers as a function of what best served their group
MISC	for example  roads become congested when everyone drives to and from work at the same time
MISC	conversely  traffic moves smoothly when businesses invoke flex hours
MISC	however  in some cases  homogeneous behavior may be preferable
MISC	for example  businesses in some sectors thrive when they all conform to the same standards
MISC	to ask whether forecasters learned to choose language that induced appropriately heterogeneous or homogeneous behavior  erev et al citation  designed a study with two different payoff conditions
MISC	in one  everyone in the group received a payoff when two members of the group responsible for making the decisions for the entire group made the same correct choice and in the other condition everyone received a payoff when at least one participant made the correct choice
MISC	in addition to possible group winnings  decision-makers won individual amounts when they were correct
MISC	the authors assumed that  number  decision-makers make choices that they believe maximize their personal chances of winning and  number  individuals differ to a greater degree in interpreting verbal than numerical probabilities
MISC	on that basis the authors predicted that forecasters would learn to give verbal judgments when heterogeneous behavior served the group's best interests decision-makers acting in their self interest would make different choices  depending on their interpretations of the verbal terms and numerical judgments when homogeneous behavior best served the group all decision-makers would make the same  most likely choice
MISC	in fact  that is how the data turned out
MISC	this finding suggests that forecasters do learn to adjust their precision of communication in response to group payoffs
MISC	for prevention behaviors  positively framed messages have been found to elicit stronger behavioral intentions than negatively framed messages
MISC	research also seems to indicate that certain contextual features contribute to the persuasiveness of a message
OWNX	consistent with our hypothesis  we found that  in our prevention focused task  increasing the number of arguments increased behavioral intentions bi for positively framed messages when subjects were cued  via negative affect  to be attentive to the message
MISC	an account of contextual influence in persuasive health messages is discussed
MISC	persuading people to adjust their behavior so that it is more consonant with a healthy lifestyle is no easy matter
MISC	health care organizations are replete with attempts at influencing people to live a more healthy life
MISC	designers of health-persuasive messages can attempt to either encourage a more healthy way of life or discourage an unhealthy one
MISC	determining how the presentational frame of the message influences individuals is of particular importance in health care since the effectiveness of the intended message can have direct bearing on human health and quality of life
MISC	the foundations for understanding how a problems frame may affect decision choice were laid by kahneman  and  tversky's  citation  prospect theory
MISC	a central aspect of this work is that people will respond differently depending upon how the decision problem is presented
MISC	specifically  decisions may be presented in such a manner as to accentuate either the positive gains or negative losses aspects of the task
MISC	the effect that positive and negative presentation has on decision choice is referred to as the framing effect
MISC	because of the vast applicability of decision framing  distinct areas of investigation have emerged
MISC	levin  schneider and gaeth  citation  lsg have distinguished between three types of framing  risky-choice  attribute and goal framing
MISC	because most research on health-related choices involves persuasion  citation   many health messages can be categorized as goal framing
MISC	a distinguishing feature of goal framing is that it attempts to persuade decision makers to adopt a specific behavior which remains the same across frames
MISC	consider the classic example provided by detweiler  bedell  salovey pronin and rothman  citation   in which beachgoers were given a message regarding sunscreen use that varied only in its gain or loss frame
MISC	both the gain and loss framed messages promoted the same behavior and were similar in length and structure
MISC	one gain framed argument was  using sunscreen increases your chances of maintaining healthy  young-looking skin
MISC	  the corresponding loss framed argument stated  not using sunscreen decreases your chances of maintaining healthy  young-looking skin
MISC	  subjects reported their behavioral intentions to use sunscreen via a questionnaire  and actual behavior was measured by noting the number of people in each condition who later redeemed a coupon for sunscreen
MISC	consistent with their previous research  gain framed messages proved to elicit greater levels of behavioral intention and actual behavior
MISC	prevention behaviors refer to those behaviors which are health-promoting and for which little risk is perceived
MISC	thus  the relative advantage for gain framed messages in regard to prevention behaviors has been well established
MISC	while the analysis provided by levin  schneider  and  gaeth provides structure for varying types of framing  it does not address the potential interactions that may exist with certain psychological variables
MISC	as they point out  goal frames are more complicated than other frames
MISC	they also add that the complication lies in how goal framing manipulates several linguistic and contextual variations within the same task
AIMX	in the present paper we set out to examine two variables that we identified as being of particular importance for this type of persuasion task  contextually influenced affect and the number of arguments presented
MISC	an extensive body of research has examined how affect and emotions can influence decision making  citation
MISC	although many different accounts depict how affect influences information processing and subsequent decision choices  one explanation is the  affect as information  account proposed by schwarz and colleagues  citation
MISC	according to this view  negative affect acts as a signal to inform people that they may not be achieving their desired state or goal for a given task
MISC	consequently  this draws their attention to the task at hand and people become more involved and attentive to the task
MISC	on the other hand  positive affect informs people that all is well and they do not need to seek out any additional information
MISC	as a result  people are less attentive and tend not to seek out additional information from the task when experiencing positive affect
MISC	supporting the affect as information view  this research has shown that negative images elicit a greater attention and stronger response than either positive or neutral stimuli  citation
MISC	however  the magnitude of this effect should be determined by both attentiveness and the framing of the task
OWNX	that is  if participants are not attentive to the task because of positive affect cues  then neither the frame nor argument number should be particularly influential
OWNX	accordingly  we predict that behavioral intentions should not differ as a function of the number of arguments when a positive background picture is present
MISC	on the other hand  when the context contains negative affect cues  the decision maker should be more attentive to the task
OWNX	in our prevention task  we predict that  for gain framed messages  persuasiveness should increase as the number of arguments increases
MISC	however  because negatively framed messages are less effective for encouraging prevention behaviors  this suggests that decision makers will be less involved in the task when it is framed negatively
OWNX	consequently  we predict that the number of arguments will be less influential when the problem is negatively framed
MISC	although theories from economics and evolutionary biology predict that one's age  health  and survival probability should be associated with one's subjective discount rate sdr  few studies have empirically tested for these links
MISC	individuals in very poor health have high discount rates  and those in very good health also have high discount rates
MISC	similarly  those with expected survival probability on the extremes have high discount rates
MISC	therefore  health and survival probability  and not age  seem to be predictors of one's sdr in an area of the world with high morbidity and mortality
MISC	people generally prefer to receive a reward sooner rather than later
MISC	the present value of a future reward is often discounted when there is a delay to receiving the reward
MISC	many terms are used to describe this phenomenon  such as time preference  positive rate of intertemporal substitution  impatience  and impulsivity
MISC	although delay discounting is a common assumption in models of intertemporal choice  the literature is relatively incomplete when it comes to why people discount the future in general and why some people discount more than others
MISC	although existing theoretical models of delay discounting often explicitly specify mortality risk which reduces opportunity for consumption in the future and morbidity risk which reduces utility from consumption in the future as determinants of delay discounting  most existing empirical tests of the theoretical models rely mostly on age as a proxy for those risks
MISC	the distinction between age and mortality morbidity may be important
MISC	if the determinants of sdr are known and if such determinants can be changed  many potentially bad outcomes related to impatience could in theory be prevented  if the willingness to wait for some future reward could be enhanced
MISC	while one's age is not changeable  one's mortality and morbidity risks can be changed  either through investment in one's own health capital or through public health interventions
MISC	if mortality and morbidity risks are causally related to one's sdr  changes in these risks can potentially lead to changes in one's sdr
OWNX	using multilevel modeling  we investigated the risk-return relationship between apparent risk taking and risk perception in  number  risk domains
MISC	the multilevel modeling shows  more interestingly  that within-participants variation in risk taking across the  number  content domains of the scale was about  number  times as large as between-participants variation
OWNX	we discuss the implications of our findings in terms of the person-situation debate related to risk attitude as a stable trait
MISC	in the expected utility framework and its variants  including prospect theory  citation   such apparent differences in risk attitude are modeled by utility functions that differ in shape  with different degrees of concavity convexity to explain risk aversion seeking
MISC	risk attitude is the parameter that differentiates between the utility functions of different individuals  citation  and is intended as nothing more than a descriptive label for the concavity or convexity of the utility function
MISC	popular interpretations of risk attitude  however  often consider it to be a personality trait  citation
MISC	the consideration of risk attitude as a personality trait has undergone a similar development as that of personality traits in general
MISC	the following two observations have been problematic for the simple expected-utility definition of risk attitude as a personality trait
MISC	first  different methods of measuring people's utility functions and thus risk attitudes have been shown to result in different classifications of individuals  citation
MISC	these problems limit the predictive validity of expected-utility based assessments of risk attitude
MISC	given the lability of expected-utility based assessments of risk attitude  it should not be surprising that measurement scales based upon them have not had much success in predicting people's choices or behaviors across a range of situations  citation
MISC	the observed content-specificity of responses suggests that they should not be combined across content domains
MISC	nevertheless  the choice dilemma questionnaire  citation   a commonly used scale  asks people for probability equivalents in twelve choice dilemmas from different domains of life  which are then combined into a single score that purportedly represents a person's risk attitude
MISC	despite its obvious deficiencies the scale is still in use  primarily for lack of better alternatives
MISC	some researchers have recently argued that risk attitude may be more usefully conceptualized in the risk-return framework of risky choice imported from finance  for example  the capital asset pricing model  citation  and its variants and generalizations  citation
MISC	psychological risk-return models treat perceived riskiness as a variable that can differ between individuals and as a function of content and context  citation
MISC	they decompose observed behavior i e   apparent risk taking into an evaluation of benefits and risks as well as a trade-off between perceived benefits and perceived risks  with a person-specific willingness to trade off units of returns for units of risk i e   attitude towards perceived risk that is assumed to be relatively stable across situations and domains  citation
MISC	this provides for multiple ways in which characteristics of the decision maker and of the situation can affect choices under risk
MISC	apparent risk taking by the same person in two situations might differ  for example  because the decision maker perceives the risks and benefits to differ in magnitude in the two domains e g   in a recreational vs a financial decision  while his or her attitude towards perceived risk is basically the same for both domains  citation
MISC	empirical investigations have shown systematic individual  group  and cultural differences in perceptions of the riskiness of risky choice options  citation
MISC	a smaller number of studies have also documented group differences in the perception of perceived benefits  citation
MISC	after accounting for differences in the perception of the risk or returns of choice alternatives  however  people's perceived-risk attitudedefined as their willingness to trade off units of perceived risk for units of perceived returnhas shown considerable cross-group and cross-situational consistency  citation
MISC	the domain-specificity of risk taking thus seems to arise primarily from differences in the perception of the risks and possibly benefits of choice alternatives in different content domains  while the trait or true attitude towards risk that shows consistency across situations lies in the evaluation of risk as it is perceived as something that is either desirable i e   worth giving up units of return for or undesirable i e   something that needs to be compensated by units of return  citation
MISC	decision domains in which respondents have shown different degrees of risk taking and different perceptions of risks and benefits include gambling  financial investing  business decisions  and personal decisions  citation
MISC	one can expect to find differences in the perception of risks and benefits in these different domains of decisions because decisions in these domains score differently on the psychological risk dimensions e g   dread  familiarity  controllability identified by slovic  fischhoff  and lichtenstein  citation  that are known to affect risk perception
MISC	given recent evidence about the prominence of affective reactions in perceptions of risk  citation   individual and domain differences in subjective perceptions of riskiness should not come as a surprise
MISC	the scale has been used and validated  and its factor structure replicated in a wide range of settings and populations see
MISC	in addition to adequate internal-consistency reliability estimates  weber et al citation  reported moderate test-retest reliability estimates and provided evidence for the factorial and convergent discriminant validity of the scores with respect to constructs such as sensation seeking  dispositional risk taking  intolerance for ambiguity  and social desirability
MISC	construct validity was also assessed via correlations with the results of a risky gambling task as well as with tests of gender differences
MISC	a recent review of a large number of instruments that measure risk propensity in healthcare decisions  citation  describes the dospert scale as one of three that are  relevant to a clinical environment as they directly measure risk propensity across a number of everyday situations  including the propensity to take health-related risks  p  number 
MISC	the dospert scale is additionally commended for its simultaneous measurement of multiple risk constructs such as risk taking  risk perception  and perceived-risk attitude
MISC	weber et al citation  also used the dospert scale to provide evidence for the psychological risk-return model of risky choice
MISC	johnson et al citation  obtained similar findings at the aggregate  or mean  level across respondents with a sample of young german adults
OWNX	the revised dospert scale was administered to groups of english- and french-speaking north americans and by doing do  we also contributed a french translation of the scale to the literature
MISC	although the dospert scale has been translated into several languages german  italian  dutch  and spanish and validated in cultures speaking these languages  citation   a french version was not available yet
MISC	as explained above  to endorse a risk-return approach in assessing apparent risk taking presupposes the involvement of various determinants  that is  perceptions of benefits and risk  as well as a more stable component that represents a person's propensity to favor or shy away from an option that he she perceives as being risky  which is referred to as a person's perceived-risk attitude  citation
MISC	unfortunately  in the present study  perceptions of benefits could not be collected due to time constraints  so the focus here is exclusively on apparent risk taking  perceived risk  and perceived-risk attitude
MISC	one of the compelling reasons for using multilevel modeling is that it allows for the decomposition of the total variance in risk taking into various components  and for the quantification and explanation of both within- and between-individuals variation in apparent risk taking
MISC	a distinction is proposed between recommending for preferred choice options and recommending against non-preferred choice options
MISC	in binary choice  both recommendation modes are logically  though not psychologically  equivalent
MISC	in addition  option attractiveness is shown to affect speakers' choice of frame  and adoption of recommendation mode
OWNX	the results are interpreted in terms of three compatibility effects  i recommendation mode-valence framing compatibility  speakers' preference for positive framing is enhanced under recommending for and diminished under recommending against instructions  ii option attractiveness-valence framing compatibility  speakers' preference for positive framing is more pronounced for attractive than for unattractive options  and iii recommendation mode-option attractiveness compatibility  speakers are more likely to adopt a recommending for approach for attractive than for unattractive binary choice pairs
MISC	framing effects have been much debated ever since tversky and kahneman  citation  showed that preference for risk is dependent on choice alternatives being framed either in positive or negative terms
MISC	early framing studies exposed participants to vignettes that contained text fragments and recorded decision makers' corresponding choices
MISC	little attention was paid in these studies to the source of the message
MISC	in reality  however  a message is transferred from a source e g   a speaker to a target e g   a listener
MISC	indeed  an analysis of the speakers' and the listeners' perspective is central to the conversational analysis of human judgment  citation  and constitutes the essence of grice's logic of conversation and relevance theory
MISC	the social context of decision making is therefore crucial when studying framing
MISC	an understanding of the pragmatics of framing requires not only the study of decision makers' responses to alternative frames  but also an examination of speakers' construction and preference among various possible frames
MISC	judged from listeners' responses  however  the inclination to use positive frames is effective for promoting riskless  but not risky options
OWNX	we demonstrated empirically that the incompatibility between speakers and listeners was due to an asymmetry in evaluation mode  citation  between speakers and listeners
MISC	speakers can jointly i e   comparatively assess the information and the persuasive qualities of alternative frames
MISC	in contrast  listeners are exposed only to one of these frames and  consequently  can assess the information only separately i e   non-comparatively
OWNX	in our earlier research we studied frame valence positive vs negative preferences of speakers' and their effectiveness in persuading listeners
OWNX	specifically  we examined the compatibility between speakers and listeners in terms of frame preferences
OWNX	in the present study we explore a closely related issue to valence framing  namely the manner by which an option is recommended
OWNX	a distinction is proposed between two general persuasive orientations that speakers might adopt   recommending for preferred choice alternatives  and  recommending against non-preferred choice alternatives
MISC	  this distinction is referred to as recommendation mode
OWNX	note that in the present context  positive and negative orientations should be interpreted not just in absolute but also in relative terms
MISC	thus  for example  saying that  item a is cheaper than item b  implies a positive recommendation for a
MISC	researchers know very little about how people choose mates
OWNX	to remedy this  the present study examined the influence of number of potential mates and mate-standard strength on single women's choice satisfaction and strategy use
OWNX	single women chose one potential partner from a set of  number    number   or  number  options presented on a real dating website
MISC	participants adjusted to an increasing number of options by changing their decision-making strategies  such that they relied on noncompensatory  attribute-based strategies as the number of options increased
OWNX	across conditions they reported similar levels of satisfaction with the choice process and the person selected

MISC	but how - if at all - do we cope with such extensive choice
MISC	auctions  normally considered as devices facilitating trade  also provide a way to probe mechanisms governing one's valuation of some good or action
MISC	one of the most intriguing phenomena in auction behavior is the winner's curse - the strong tendency of participants to bid more than rational agent theory prescribes  often at a significant loss
MISC	the prevailing explanation suggests that humans have limited cognitive abilities that make estimating the correct bid difficult  if not impossible
MISC	however  the winner's curse appears when participants compete against other humans  even when cognitive demands for the correct bidding strategy are removed
MISC	these results suggest the humans assign significant future value to victories over human but not over computer opponents even though such victories may incur immediate losses  and that this valuation anomaly is the origin of apparently irrational behavior
MISC	auctions of various types constitute a ubiquitous mechanism for buying and selling items of limited quantity or availability
MISC	given the commonality of auctions  it is noteworthy that under fairly general conditions  even highly experienced bidders tend to suffer net losses  citation
MISC	this fact has come to be called the winner's curse and was first identified in auctions for drilling rights in the gulf of mexico  citation
MISC	the winner's curse arises in auctions for items of fixed  but unknown  value known as common value auctions
MISC	oil drilling rights satisfy these conditions because the amount of oil in a region and hence its market value is the same for all bidders  yet cannot be precisely estimated
MISC	if participants bid their estimated value  the winner of the auction will be that participant with the most optimistic estimate
MISC	since estimates are distributed around the true value  the most optimistic estimate will generally be an overestimate of the true value and a net loss will therefore occur for that bidder
MISC	hence  on average the winner is cursed by the statistical fact that their estimate is more likely than not to be greater than the true value
MISC	to avoid the winner's curse it is necessary to modify one's bid beyond one's estimate of the true value to account for the conditional probability of winning the auction
MISC	that is  a  good  bid ought to be sufficiently less than one's estimate in order to acknowledge the fact that winning is most likely to occur for an overestimate
MISC	in practice  auction participants do modify their bids strategically  but the correction is not sufficient to avoid the winner's curse  citation
MISC	there have been several proposed mechanisms for the winner's curse  citation
MISC	these explanations generally propose that bidders fail to perform rationally due to cognitive limitations  citation
MISC	the hypothesis is that people understand they must submit bids less than their estimates  but they are unable to accurately calculate exactly how much less to bid
OWNX	we first present data demonstrating that the winner's curse is not a consequence of limited cognitive abilities
OWNX	we then demonstrate that the curse depends instead on the social nature of the auction environment
MISC	previous work on the psychology of auctions has demonstrated that social influences have a significant effect on bidding
MISC	in escalating auctions  in which participants bid sequentially until a single high bidder remains  people are subject to intense emotions that impede rationalization and may lead to extremely high bids  citation
MISC	the winner's curse has previously be thought to be an entirely separate phenomenon because the uncertainty inherent in common value auctions presumably make cognitive demands overwhelming  citation
OWNX	additionally  in our experiments the social environment is minimal
MISC	each participant submits a sealed bid essentially in isolation and the highest submitted bid wins  leaving no opportunity for competitive fire to escalate with the progression of the auction
OWNX	our findings address both of these points
MISC	first  despite the challenges posed by lack of information in common value auctions  people are able to converge to stable bidding strategies in less than  number  trials that remain constant when cognitive demands are eliminated
MISC	these intuitive representations of the mental number line have been demonstrated across species and human development but have been little explored in decision making
OWNX	we demonstrate that individuals with more precise mental-number-line representations are higher in numeracy number skills consistent with previous research with children
MISC	individuals with more precise representations compared to those with less precise representations also were more likely to choose larger  later amounts over smaller  immediate amounts  particularly with a larger proportional difference between the two monetary outcomes
MISC	in addition  they were more likely to choose an option with a larger proportional but smaller absolute difference compared to those with less precise representations
MISC	these results are consistent with intuitive number representations underlying  a perceived differences between numbers  b the extent to which proportional differences are weighed in decisions  and  ultimately  c the valuation of decision options
MISC	human decision processes involving numbers important to health and financial matters may be rooted in elementary  biological processes shared with other species
MISC	intuitive representations of the mental number line are defined as nonverbal representations of numerosity that are spontaneously activated in the presence of numeric information regardless of format  citation
MISC	the representations are  inner marks  that allow verbal and nonverbal animals to  think unnamed numbers   citation
MISC	trained monkeys  for example  can order objects  number - number  by their numerosity  citation
MISC	adult humans can perform arithmetic operations quickly on larger arrays of dots using these nonverbal mental magnitudes  citation
MISC	the number domain is a prime example where strong evidence points to a biologically determined  domain-specific representation of number and elementary arithmetic operations linked to the inferior parietal cortex  specifically the horizontal intra-parietal sulcus in both adults and children  citation
MISC	arabic  spelled-out  and spoken numerals all activate this area so that it is thought to be involved in cross-modal  abstract representation and manipulation of the quantity meaning of numbers  rather than being activated by any specific number notation  citation
MISC	numerical-cognition researchers believe that this basic numerical intuition lays the foundation for uniquely human mathematical reasoning  citation
MISC	number intuitions  however  are limited in their representational power and do not directly support concepts of fractions  probabilities  or even the precise numbers important to many decisions
MISC	although little research exists  processing these more sophisticated concepts is thought to be based nonetheless on humans' basic  number sense  with brain areas originally developed for other purposes co-opted for nonintuitive  symbolic number processing
MISC	less numerate individuals  however  fare less well in important medical and financial decisions involving numeric information  citation
MISC	two experiments examined the benefits of unconscious thought on complex decisions  citation
MISC	experiment  number  attempted to replicate the findings of dijksterhuis  bos  nordgren  and van baaren  citation  and determine if a memory aid could overcome the limitations of conscious thought on complex tasks
MISC	results revealed that a memory aid improved decisions compared to the conscious thought condition
MISC	participants in the unconscious thought condition did not perform significantly better than did participants in the conscious thought condition
MISC	by devoting attention and conscious thought to a difficult decision  one can carefully consider and weigh the various options and choose the option that best matches one's goals
MISC	wilson and schooler  citation  challenged this assumption when they found that participants asked to think about their reasons for a decision made apparently worse decisions than participants who did not reflect on their reasons for a decision
MISC	recent work  citation  has cast further doubt on the benefits of consciously thinking about one's decisions by demonstrating that consciously thinking about complex tasks i e   tasks which consist of numerous attributes that participants must weigh in order to determine the best option can lead to poorer performance than unconscious thought
MISC	some recent attempts to replicate this effect have been unsuccessful  citation
AIMX	this paper attempts to replicate the beneficial effects of unconscious thought on complex tasks found by dijksterhuis and colleagues and to examine some conditions that may limit the effect
MISC	although the priority heuristic ph is conceived as a cognitive-process model  some of its critical process assumptions remain to be tested
OWNX	the ph makes very strong ordinal and quantitative assumptions about the strictly sequential  non-compensatory use of three cues in choices between lotteries   number  the difference between worst outcomes   number  the difference in worst-case probabilities  and  number  the best outcome that can be obtained
OWNX	these aspects were manipulated orthogonally in the present experiment
MISC	overall winning probabilities that the ph ignores exerted a systematic influence
MISC	for almost four decades  theoretical and empirical work on judgment and decision making has been inspired by the notion of cognitive heuristics
MISC	they are usually content with non-optimal but satisficing solutions  citation
MISC	the cognitive tools that afford such satisficing solutions are commonly called heuristics
MISC	their reputation has improved enormously
MISC	having first been devalued as mental short-cuts  sloppy rules of thumb  and sources of biases and shortcomings  in the more recent literature heuristics are often characterized as fast  frugal  and functional
MISC	 simple heuristics that make us smart   citation  were shown to outperform more ambitious models of rational inference in simulation studies  citation
MISC	thus  for a crucial test of the assumption that judgments of frequency or probability actually follow the availability heuristic  citation   it is essential to manipulate its crucial feature  namely the ease with which information comes to mind
MISC	likewise  for a cogent test of the anchoring heuristic  citation   it has to be shown that judges actually adjust an initial extreme anchor insufficiently
MISC	without appropriate experimental manipulations of the presumed mental operations  it is impossible to prove the causal role of the hypothesized heuristic process
MISC	the percentage of a focal heuristic's correct predictions of judgments or decisions cannot provide cogent and distinct evidence about the underlying process  citation
MISC	in the early stage of the heuristics-and-biases research program  though  serious experimental attempts to assess the postulated cognitive operations had been remarkably rare
MISC	more recently  though  this situation has been changing
MISC	a number of fast and frugal heuristics have been specified precisely enough to allow for strict experimental tests of underlying cognitive processes
MISC	tests of the take-the-best heuristic  citation  have been concerned with the assumption that cues can be ordered by validity  citation
MISC	research on the recognition heuristic tested whether comparative judgments are really determined by mere exposure rather than a substantive evaluation of the comparison objects  citation
MISC	it seems fair to conclude that strict empirical tests have resulted in a more critical picture of the validity and scope of the postulated heuristics  citation
MISC	health care resource allocation is a central moral issue in health policy  and opinions about it have been studied extensively
MISC	on the other hand  the negative valence allocation situation i e   who should not receive medical aid has been relatively neglected
AIMX	this paper demonstrates how positive versus negative framing of the exact same health care resource allocation situation can affect the perceived fairness of allocation principles
MISC	participants usually perceived non-egalitarian principles i e   need  equity and tenure to be fairer in positively framed situations i e   to deliver health care resources to certain patients than negatively framed situation i e   not to deliver health care resources to other patients
MISC	however  framing did not affect the perceived fairness of the equality principle i e   a random draw
AIMX	the paper offers a theoretical explanation for the effect of framing on the perceived fairness of health care resource allocation and discusses implications for both researchers and policy makers
MISC	the issue of allocating health care resources to recipients is a central medical and ethical concern  citation
MISC	patients in need of medical aid frequently rely on the generosity of their community for survival
MISC	however  a community usually has a finite amount of health care resources  and the question of how these lifesaving but scarce health care resources should be distributed has been studied extensively  citation
MISC	as can be expected  the just allocation of social resources occupies many scholars  and different theories advocate different allocation principles
MISC	citation  in the normative tradition of miller's theory of justice  citation  and the multiprinciple approach  citation   three principles have usually been identified as central to the concept of distributive justice  equity  equality and need  citation
MISC	to realize the equity principle  one can allocate resources on the basis of ability  effort or merit  citation
MISC	for example  if the decision is to allocate aid to all except claimants who are responsible for their illness  the decision can be viewed as based on a merit principle  because claimants who are not responsible for their illness are considered as more deserving than claimants who are responsible for their illness
MISC	the principle of need is usually achieved by allocating according to individuals' medical condition  socio-economical status or other relevant needs  citation
MISC	the principle of tenure in terms of a waiting list is often used in health care resource allocations
MISC	in the uk  for example  the length of time a patient spends on a waiting list is used as the main criterion for donor liver allocations
MISC	the use of this tenure principle is also quite common in the usa  citation
MISC	judgments about allocation of health care resources  as well as actual allocations  are usually complex and dependent on many variables  such as the resource availability  the claimants' need for help  and their deservingness  citation
MISC	public opinion on the appropriate allocation of scarce health care resources e g   organ transplantations  new vaccinations or treatments may affect actual outcomes
MISC	people's readiness to donate organs  for example  may be affected by their views concerning the fairness of the system  citation
MISC	one major challenge to behavioral decision research is to identify the cognitive processes underlying judgment and decision making
MISC	glockner  citation  has argued that  compared to previous methods  process models can be more efficiently tested by simultaneously analyzing choices  decision times  and confidence judgments
OWNX	in the present article  we describe the implementation of mm-ml in r  a free package for data analysis under the gnu general public license  and we provide a practical guide to application
OWNX	we also provide mm-ml as an easy-to-use r function
MISC	thus  prior knowledge of r programming is not necessary for those interested in using mm-ml
MISC	it has been repeatedly argued that individuals make adaptive use of different decision strategies  citation  and that the application of the respective strategy might depend on different factors such as participants' characteristics  citation   effort accuracy trade-offs  citation   learning experiences  citation   presentation format  citation  and situational forces  citation
MISC	some strategies might be entirely based on deliberate computations  citation
MISC	others  by contrast  might partially rely on automatic-intuitive processes  citation
MISC	glockner and betsch  citation  showed that classic process tracing methods such as mouselab  citation  might hinder information search processes that are necessary for applying automatic processes
MISC	furthermore  taking into account intuitive-automatic processes  many strategies make essentially the same choice predictions  citation
MISC	glockner  citation  showed that  considering strategies that make different choice predictions  people can be more efficiently classified by applying the multiple-measure maximum likelihood strategy classification method mm-ml as compared to relying on a choice-based strategy classification alone  citation
MISC	preparing an experiment to generate data for the application of the mm-ml method comprises three basic steps   number  choose dependent measures and specify the distributions of those measures   number  choose a set of strategies   number  select items that differentiate between the considered strategies and derive predictions on the dependent measures
MISC	then the fit of the predictions of the strategies to individuals' empirical data is calculated using mm-ml and the strategy most likely accounting for individuals' behavior is identified
MISC	the sunk cost fallacy is the tendency to continue an endeavour once an investment in money  effort  or time has been made
OWNX	we studied how people's chronic orientation to cope with failing projects i e   action vs state orientation influences the occurrence of this sunk cost effect
MISC	people with an action orientation  who more easily let go of past events  were not susceptible to the sunk cost effect
OWNX	we discuss the implications of these results for the sunk cost fallacy literature
MISC	it makes no sense to eat a dessert that you dislike  or pay a stock broker knowing that the money will be lost  right
MISC	yet  many people do exactly this  they make investments that will be in vain to prevent wasting earlier investments
MISC	having paid for a dessert  people thus feel they should finish it  even though the dessert is not to their liking  it would be a waste to  pay and not eat 
MISC	in a similar vein  people may be reluctant to sell their losing stocks  because by selling they would have to acknowledge that their prior investments were wasted
MISC	this tendency to honor prior costs by holding on to failing projects is called the sunk cost fallacy  citation
MISC	in more general terms  the sunk cost fallacy describes the tendency  to continue an endeavour once an investment in money  effort  or time has been made   citation
MISC	people regularly use sunk costs to justify further investments in many decisions  ranging from the decision to eat a dessert one has already paid for  citation  to the decision to continue research and development of already outperformed products  citation
MISC	this effect is not restricted to consumer behavior or economic decision making  but extends to many other decisions  including policy making
MISC	for instance  one of the important reasons to continue the war in iraq was to prevent acknowledging that soldiers who fell in battle died in vain
MISC	the sunk cost fallacy thus influences many decisions  from very mundane to highly exceptional  and affects all sorts of people ranging from customers in restaurants to the most important and influential leaders
MISC	from the above it is clear that people are likely to become victims of the sunk cost fallacy
MISC	some people seem to dwell more on the past than others
MISC	such differences in coping have been demonstrated in the extensive research on state versus action orientation
MISC	action-oriented people typically get over negative events quickly  and focus on taking action to solve them  while state-oriented people typically find it difficult to overcome a negative event  and keep ruminating about it and how it affects their current state  citation
MISC	this distinction seems highly relevant to the question of whether people differ in their susceptibility to the sunk cost fallacy
MISC	although prior investments like paying for a dessert  or buying stocks may not be seen as negative events  they may become negative if they are not compensated by current and future outcomes i e   if the dessert tastes horrible  and the stocks lose their value
MISC	the more action-oriented people are  the more likely they are to focus on the future and what they can achieve  thereby weakening the association between current decisions and previous investments
MISC	these predictions are particularly interesting in relation to prior reasoning in the action orientation literature
MISC	there  the assumption is often made that an action-oriented mindset increases the likelihood of finishing a project  citation
MISC	moreover  it is argued that it is against the nature of action-oriented people to quit an already started project  citation
MISC	thus  in the case of sunk costs  applying this reasoning leads to the counterintuitive prediction that the more action-oriented people are  the more likely they are to quit the project they started investing in
OWNX	we expected to find stronger sunk cost effects for state-oriented people than for action-oriented people
MISC	the results suggest that judgments are easily influenced by affiliation with interested partisans  and that this influence extends to judgments made with clear incentives for objectivity
OWNX	we conclude by exploring implications of this finding for professional conduct and public policy
MISC	in many situations  professionals are called upon to play dual roles that require different perspectives
MISC	for example  attorneys embroiled in pretrial negotiations may exaggerate their chances of winning in court to extract concessions from the other side
MISC	but when it comes time to advise the client on whether to accept a settlement offer  the client needs objective advice
MISC	professors  likewise  have to evaluate the performance of graduate students and provide them with both encouragement and criticism
MISC	but public criticism is less helpful when faculty serve as their students' advocates in the job market
MISC	and  although auditors have a legal responsibility to judge the accuracy of their clients' financial accounting  the way to win a client's business is not by stressing one's legal obligation to independence  but by emphasizing the helpfulness and accommodation one can provide
MISC	traditional economic models of rationality would assume that people can perform optimally in such situations  making unbiased judgments when it is in their interest to do so  but taking a partisan stand when this is called for strategically
OWNX	in our attempt to answer this question  we explore the psychology of conflict of interest by comparing alternative explanations for their effects
OWNX	after reviewing research on whether and when people are able to play dual roles  we present findings from three studies
MISC	these studies examine a fairly typical business situation - a situation in which an advocate must provide a deliberately partisan valuation of a company and then is asked to provide an impartial valuation of the same company
OWNX	we ask whether these advocates can successfully make impartial  unbiased judgments in situations characterized by such dual roles
OWNX	we conclude by speculating about the implications of this psychological finding to issues of professional conduct  public policy  governmental regulation  and organizational design
OWNX	genetic screening for brca number  and brca number  gives women the opportunity for early detection  surveillance  and intervention
MISC	one key feature of genetic testing and counseling is the provision of personal lifetime risk
OWNX	to study this vital issue  we set out to test the ability of women to choose the most appropriate interpretation of national cancer institute's nci message about lifetime risk of developing cancer for a woman with altered brca number  and brca number  genes
OWNX	participants included  number  women who had not undergone genetic testing or had cancer and  number  women who had undergone genetic testing or had cancer
OWNX	over  number  percent  of the women who had not undergone genetic testing or had cancer and  number  percent  of those who had undergone genetic testing or had cancer misunderstood nci's information
OWNX	furthermore  in line with a growing body of research  we found that high numeracy level objective or subjective is positively associated with a woman's ability to correctly interpret nci's message
OWNX	genetic screening for brca number  and brca number  - gene mutations that are associated with higher risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers - gives women a shot at early detection  surveillance  and intervention  citation
MISC	one key feature of the genetic counseling process is the provision of personal lifetime risk - or the risk of developing a specific disease during one's lifetime  citation
MISC	indeed  both patients and genetic counselors rate communication of lifetime risk information as a pivotal part of the process  citation
OWNX	although earlier studies examined women's estimation of their lifetime risk  a more fundamental issue is how women interpret lifetime risk information
OWNX	after all  if women misunderstand the meaning of lifetime risk  whether they overestimate or underestimate incorrectly interpreted risk would be less important
MISC	indeed  research has shown that people interpret numerical probabilities in multiple  mutually contradictory ways
MISC	researchers  citation  have demonstrated that individuals interpret the seemingly unambiguous statement  there is a  number  percent  chance of rain tomorrow  in different ways   it will rain tomorrow in  number  percent  of the region    for  number  percent  of the time   or  on  number  percent  of the days like tomorrow   citation
MISC	a growing corpus of research has shown that numeracy - the ability to understand basic mathematical concepts - is important to the quality of decisions  citation
MISC	accordingly  researchers have long argued that numeracy levels play a key role in a host of medical decision making and might influence the way people perceive and understand risk  citation
MISC	a recent review  citation  summarized this idea well   low numeracy is pervasive and constrains informed patient choice impairs risk communication  and affects medical outcome   citation
OWNX	we first predicted that a statement about lifetime risk of developing cancer would give rise to various interpretations  not all of which would be correct
OWNX	second  we predicted that participants with higher numeracy levels will have a better understanding of lifetime risk information than their peers with lower numeracy levels
OWNX	we compared south koreans with australians in order to characterize cultural differences in attitudes and choices regarding risk  at both the individual and group levels
OWNX	our results showed that australians  when assessed individually  consistently self-reported higher preference for risk than south koreans  regardless of gender
MISC	the data revealed that south koreans  regardless of gender composition  were willing to take greater risks when making decisions in group decision-making situations than when they were alone
MISC	it has been frequently observed  and generally accepted  that males are more likely than females to engage in risk-taking behaviors
MISC	males participate more frequently than females in a variety of risky activities  including drinking alcohol and smoking korea national statistical office  knso    number 
MISC	road traffic mortality rates are higher for males than females road traffic authority  rta    number 
MISC	similar patterns in road traffic accidents have been noted in the americas  europe  asia  and africa world health organization  who    number   who   number 
MISC	consistent with these observed phenomena  a meta-analysis of  number  studies of risk-taking has also suggested the existence of reliable gender differences in self-reported behavior  hypothetical choice  and observed behaviors  although the magnitude of cohen's effect size was relatively small for each category  citation  and there is some variation from category to category  citation
OWNX	in this study  we have attempted to determine  from a cross-cultural perspective  the manner in which the attitudes and choices regarding risk made by collectivists - specifically  south koreans - differ from those of individualists - in this case  australians - at both the individual and group levels
MISC	that is  decompressing the graph axis scale changed the relative distance with respect to the options of a given attribute and thus changed the salience of the information in graphical representations
MISC	experiment  number  disentangled the effect of scale distance manipulation from the other variables e g   scale resolution and assignment of attributes to axes and further supported the finding of experiment  number 
MISC	this finding is not consistent with the axioms of normative economic theory
MISC	experiment  number  also tested the attribute importance hypothesis  but the evidence indicated that the participants did not regard the longer axis as the more important attribute
OWNX	finally  we related our findings to the impact of visual processing on decision making and discussed them from the perspective of two-system cognitive theory
MISC	people often focus on a single  salient aspect of a problem and overlook the rest when making a decision
MISC	such a limited focus can cause a bias in the decision making process and leads to results that violate the axioms of normative economic theory
MISC	interestingly  incidental information e g   the way that preferences are elicited and the wording of the options could in some cases determine which information is perceived as salient  and thus what people would focus on in decision making situations
MISC	evidence has indicated that the means of preference elicitation e g   choose vs reject is likely to shift the focus of decision makers
MISC	as a result  a preference-reversal occurs when the same enriched option was the majority choice for both choosing and rejecting
MISC	in line with this focusing view  jones  frisch  yurak  and kim  citation  reported an interesting framing effect caused by the description of the options
MISC	  people paid equal attention to each of the options
MISC	  people focused their attention on the single option that was explicitly mentioned
MISC	thus preference was changed when the opportunity description made the single option more salient
MISC	levin  citation  and levin and gaeth  citation  evaluated the associative effects of various ways of framing consumer information and found that the consumers' evaluations were more favorable toward beef labeled   number  percent  lean  than to that labeled   number  percent  fat   because the information about the lean percentage was salient in the former but not in the latter
MISC	kahneman and tversky  citation  found that there was a pseudo-certainty effect in a two-stage risky choice  showing that individuals tended to neglect an earlier contingency and only focus on the second contingent decision
MISC	recently  li  su and sun  citation  reported a similar pseudo-immediacy effect in a two-stage intertemporal choice
MISC	interestingly  people also tend to make biased spatial judgments as a result of focusing only on the most salient aspects of spatial stimuli  ignoring other dimensions
MISC	for example  piaget  citation  found that children appeared to use only the height of a container when making volume judgments and ignored the diameter of the cylinder
MISC	raghubir and krishna  citation  even found similar results with adults
MISC	verge and bogartz  citation  asked children to adjust a square to match the area of a rectangle and found that the majority of children tended to equate the side of the square with either the width or the height of the rectangle and neglect the other relevant dimension
MISC	similarly  raghubir and krishna  citation  found that people often use the direct distance between the endpoints of a nonstraight path as a proxy for distance judgment  with little regard for the path configuration
MISC	in a recent study  this direct distance bias was even able to be found in a real stock market situation  in which the information was presented using graphs
MISC	the stocks with the higher run lengths were often perceived as riskier  citation
MISC	since people often focus on the most salient aspects in spatial judgments and tend to be biased by the focus of attention in choice  as reviewed above  we conjectured that the focusing bias would also appear in decision making problems presented with graphs  if we manipulated the graphical representations of the options
MISC	that is  the waiting time attribute appears to be relatively salient in figure  number   whereas the money amount attribute appears to be relatively salient in figure  number 
MISC	imagine that  you applied for a scholarship
MISC	 two types of scholarships a  b were presented with graphs involving two attributes money amounts and waiting time
MISC	  obviously  you would be glad if you could get a scholarship with less waiting time but more money
OWNX	we hypothesized that the evaluation of the two types would be affected by the scale employed in the graphs  since people tend to focus on the salient attribute
MISC	specifically  the preference strength for type a would be higher in participants who saw figure  number  than in those who saw figure  number   but the reverse would be true for type b
MISC	the gambler's fallacy and the hot hand belief have been classified as two exemplars of human misperceptions of random sequential events
MISC	this article examines the times of pattern occurrences where a fair or biased coin is tossed repeatedly
OWNX	we demonstrate that  due to different pattern composition  two different statistics mean time and waiting time can arise from the same independent bernoulli trials
MISC	when the coin is fair  the mean time is equal for all patterns of the same length but the waiting time is the longest for streak patterns
MISC	when the coin is biased  both mean time and waiting time change more rapidly with the probability of heads for a streak pattern than for a non-streak pattern
MISC	these facts might provide a new insight for understanding why people view streak patterns as rare and remarkable
MISC	the statistics of waiting time may not justify the prediction by the gambler's fallacy  but paying attention to streaks in the hot hand belief appears to be meaningful in detecting the changes in the underlying process
MISC	the gambler's fallacy and the hot hand belief have been classified as two exemplars of human misperceptions of random sequential events and widely studied in multiple disciplines such as psychology  sports  behavioral economics and neuroeconomics  citation
MISC	often manifested in more intricate forms  these two phenomena can be demonstrated by independent and identically distributed bernoulli trials
MISC	suppose that a fair coin with equal probabilities of coming up a head  h  and a tail  t  is tossed repeatedly and the first three outcomes produce three heads  h h h
MISC	in predicting the next outcome  one with the gambler's fallacy would predict  h h h t  - a reversal of the streak
MISC	in contrast  one with the hot hand belief would predict  h h h h  - a continuation of the streak
MISC	among existing theories  a prevailing account is the representativeness heuristic  which attributes both the gambler's fallacy and the hot hand belief to a false belief of the  law of small numbers   citation
MISC	thus  in the gambler's fallacy  a tail is due to reverse a streak of heads
MISC	in the hot hand belief  a streak of successes may indicate the existence of a hot hand by which the streak tends to be prolonged  citation
MISC	however  the representativeness account has been criticized for its incompleteness and testability  citation
MISC	ayton and fischer  citation  suggest that the gambler's fallacy arises from the experience of negative recency in sequences of natural events such as roulette games  but the hot hand belief arises from the experience of positive recency in serial fluctuations in human performance
MISC	similarly  it has been proposed that the hot hand belief can arise when people evaluate the performance of a mutual fund manager rather than the fluctuations of the portfolio  citation   or  the gambler's luck rather than the outcomes of a roulette game  citation
MISC	burns  citation  further argues that the hot hand belief is a fast and frugal heuristic to detect changes in the shooting accuracy of basketball players
MISC	for example  after making several shots in a row  a player might try a more difficult shot or the opponent players may increase the defense effort
MISC	citation compared to the representativeness account  the alternative interpretations distinguish the hot hand belief from the gambler's fallacy by deviations from a random process
MISC	when the underlying process is truly random or statistically impossible to tell apart from independent and stationary bernoulli trials  both beliefs are considered as biases or misperceptions of randomness
MISC	in particular  both beliefs appear to share a common intuition that streak patterns are  rare  and  remarkable  - a streak of heads is unlikely to occur if the coin is fair  or  a basketball player is unlikely to make shots in streaks unless he or she has a hot hand
MISC	however  the independence assumption of bernoulli trials states that  for a fair coin  a streak will occur as often as any other patterns of the same length in its exact order  citation
MISC	then  what is so special about streak patterns that people normally tend to avoid them and only expect them when they feel  hot 
OWNX	we exemplify by comparing two patterns  h h h t  and  h h h h
MISC	when a fair coin is tossed repeatedly  both patterns have the same probability of occurrence in any four successive trials
MISC	however  it takes on average  number  tosses to encounter the first occurrence of  h h h t  but  number  tosses to encounter the first occurrence of  h h h h
MISC	in other words  streak pattern  h h h h  has been  delayed  for its first occurrence
MISC	the expected number of trials required for the first occurrence of a particular pattern is a statistical property known as  waiting time   which can be different among patterns due to different pattern compositions  citation
MISC	while the probability of occurrence or frequency describes how often a pattern occurs  the waiting time describes when a pattern will occur from the time at which monitoring begins
MISC	interestingly  these are different statistical properties and clearly bear different psychological relevance
MISC	for example  for a passenger who is waiting for a bus  when the first bus arrives probably is more relevant than how often the bus arrives
OWNX	it is the goal of this paper to demonstrate a plausible link between the statistics of pattern times and people's perception of randomness
MISC	it is important to note that the concept of waiting time has recently received attention in psychology literature  citation
MISC	hahn and warren  citation  show that  in a global sequence of moderate length  streak patterns such as  h h h h  have higher  probabilities of nonoccurrence  than  h h h t
MISC	sun  tweney  and wang  citation  criticize hahn and warren's interpretation by clarifying the relationship between the probability of nonoccurrence and waiting time
MISC	notwithstanding the debate  the argument of treating waiting time as a part of the environmental statistics appears to be quite plausible
MISC	given that different statistics can arise from the same process of coin tossing or basketball shooting  it is likely that they have been actually experienced by people and have different effects on people's perception of randomness
OWNX	furthermore  we find that when both positive heaven and negative hell incentives are available  the former have a much stronger effect than the latter
MISC	many studies have examined the role of incentives and their effect on the behavior of individuals  citation
MISC	in this study  the interest falls on the effect of incentives on religious behavior in the sense that they increase decrease individual religious performance
MISC	religious practice can be encouraged by two types of incentives  earthly ones and afterlife ones
MISC	previous studies have analyzed the effects of  afterlife incentives  on religious behavior
MISC	they analyzed the determinants of participation in religious activities using a utility-maximizing model
MISC	among other results  they found afterlife beliefs to be a major determinant of church attendance
MISC	using several surveys carried out in the united states  they provided empirical support for their theory
MISC	blomberg et al citation  developed a model where financial religious contributions are motivated by both current consumption and afterlife considerations
MISC	pyne  citation  studied the relationship between religiosity and the fear of death
MISC	he found that individuals who place a higher probability on the existence of an afterlife invest more in religious capital
MISC	recently  bra  xf number  as-garza et al citation  estimated the role of afterlife beliefs in the production of religious commodities  concretely  church attendance and prayer
MISC	using ordered logit regressions  they found that afterlife beliefs are crucial determinants but  more importantly  that beliefs in heaven are much more relevant than beliefs in hell  positive incentives are stronger than negative ones
OWNX	when the logit model contains interactions among variables two problems appear  i the computation of partial effects becomes problematic  ii the interpretation of these estimate effects is not straightforward
MISC	as showed in norton et al citation  the estimated coefficients of the interaction terms do not reflect the interaction effect  moreover their statistical significance cannot be tested through a simple t-test
MISC	even more problematic is the interpretation given that the estimated interaction effect is also conditional on the current value of the other independent variables
OWNX	hence  we cannot properly study the meaning of different interactions in a logit regression model
AIMX	this paper presents a different statistical tool - the stochastic dominance approach  citation  - that allows the use and the straightforward interpretation of the joint effect of positive and negative incentives
OWNX	in an easy and graphical way we show that afterlife incentives play a crucial role in religious performance  comparing not only and positive or negative incentives but combination of both are compared
MISC	the study was carried out on catholic people
MISC	in the catholic religion  church attendance and prayer are strategies that lead to heaven and prevent hell
MISC	church attendance and prayer are two dimensions of religiosity that reflect public religious activities versus private intimate prayer activities
MISC	while church attendance also has non-religious motives such as networking and the building of social ties  private prayer activity has more pure religious motives
MISC	according to construal level theory  citation  including an aua would decrease the attractiveness of near future sets  but may increase the attractiveness of distant future sets
MISC	in four studies participants imagined a choice situation with three alternatives
OWNX	for some participants a fourth alternatives was added  which was attractive but unattainable
MISC	half of the participants in each condition imagined making a decision in the near future whereas others imagined making the decision in the distant future
OWNX	we examined choices between jobs  computers and roommates
OWNX	consistent with our hypothesis  an aua increased the evaluation of the distant set and decreased the evaluation of the near set
OWNX	a closer look discloses that this most attractive package is offered exclusively to members of the hilton club  which you are not
OWNX	how would the existence of this very attractive but unattainable alternative aua affect your evaluation of the set of vacation plans the travel agency offers
MISC	would you stay with this agency or look for other agencies
MISC	some decision makers may find the situation annoying
MISC	compared to the aua  the other vacation plans would seem mediocre  and the entire menu that the agency offers would lose attractiveness
MISC	obviously  including an aua is costless
MISC	is it a good strategy
MISC	would it reduce or increase the attractiveness of the entire set
MISC	related to this question  research on the phantom decoy effect found that  when choosing between two equally desirable alternatives  adding a phantom decoy - namely  an alternative that is worse than both initial alternatives and is dominated by one of them - increases choice of the alternative that dominates the decoy  citation
MISC	for example  a decision maker may feel indifferent between a five-star restaurant that is  number  minutes drive away and three-star restaurant that is  number  minutes drive away
MISC	offering a third alternative - a four-star restaurant that is  number  minutes drive away  may cause the decision maker to prefer the five-star restaurant that is  number  minutes drive away  citation
MISC	both phantom decoys and auas are irrelevant
OWNX	unlike a phantom decoy  however  an aua is more attractive than the other alternatives
OWNX	we investigate the impact of an attractive but irrelevant alternative on the evaluation of the entire set of alternatives
OWNX	in what follows  we explicate how this prediction derives from clt and test it in four studies
MISC	construal level theory  citation  proposes that psychological distance from a decision influences individuals' evaluations of the alternatives by systematically changing the way they construe these alternatives
MISC	people tend to construe more psychologically distant alternatives on a higher level  namely  using more abstract  generalized representations
MISC	high-level construals abstract the essential qualities of events and  therefore  consist of more central and essential features
MISC	in contrast  low-level construals may include more peripheral and less essential features of events
MISC	thus  whereas representations of near future events are rich with details  representations of distant future events omit secondary and incidental features of events
MISC	high level features are those that when altered or removed cause more change to the situation
MISC	there are two non-exclusive ways in which clt might predict that distance would increase the beneficial impact or decrease the detrimental impact of auas on sets of alternatives
MISC	in contrast  feasibility considerations i e   the ease or difficulty of reaching that end-state constitute a low-level construal of the alternative and should receive less weight in a more distant future decision  citation
MISC	second  temporal distance may affect the likelihood of assimilation versus contrast
MISC	forster  liberman  and kutchel  citation  recently showed that psychological distance enhances assimilation as opposed to contrast of a target to a category
MISC	for example  in one of their experiments  participants compared their athletic skills to either a moderately high standard or a moderately low standard and then rated their expected athletic performance in an athletic competition that would take place either the next day or a year later
MISC	compared to a control condition  in which time was not specified  a distant time perspective enhanced assimilation i e   produced a high self-rating after comparison to a high standard and a low self-rating after comparison to a low standard whereas a proximal time perspective enhanced contrast i e   produced a low self-rating after comparison to a high standard and a high self-rating after comparison to a low standard
MISC	possibly  temporal proximity would make participants more likely to contrast the aua from the set  and cause the set to be evaluated more negatively than without an aua
MISC	temporal distance  on the other hand  would reduce contrast or produce assimilation of the set from the aua
MISC	as a result  the entire set of alternatives will not look worse and may even look better in the presence of an aua than without it
MISC	in addition to this predicted interaction between time and adding an aua  there might be also main effects of both factors
MISC	specifically  adding an aua might produce either an overall assimilation effect or an overall contrast effect  citation
MISC	temporal distance  too  might decrease or increase the attractiveness of a set of alternatives  due to temporal discounting  citation  or savoring  citation   respectively
MISC	before the recent recession evoked general dismay and uncertainty  this study examined the relative contribution of income and the concern over financial security to life satisfaction
MISC	the degree to which such concerns permeate people's daily lives could be part of the broader concept of wealth  often measured through income and debt  and could help evaluate fiscal instruments promoting financial security
MISC	further  outlook on financial security adds to the prediction of life satisfaction above the contribution of income
MISC	content analysis revealed that nearly half the participants n    number   study  number  mentioned financial concerns - retirement  college tuition  making ends meet  etc
MISC	- when asked to think about  the future  in an open-ended manner
OWNX	these participants reported lower life satisfaction compared with women who did not raise such concerns
MISC	the link between concerns over financial security and life satisfaction  which cannot be fully accounted for by income alone  could guide policy decisions on whether to directly allocate resources toward increasing income or to focus on creating a social and financial safety net
OWNX	this study aimed to assess the degree to which women's concerns over financial security permeate their daily lives
MISC	in addition  expanding the concept of wealth should inspire well-being researchers and policy makers to inquire participants about financial security alongside questions about income
MISC	easterlin  citation  referred to the puzzling dissociation between money and satisfaction as the  illusion of growth and happiness    citation  and this disparity has been dubbed  the easterlin paradox
MISC	  one of the proposed explanations was the satisfaction treadmill   citation  according to which an improved financial state raises aspirations so that the person now wishes for greater financial gains or other achievements  thus preventing satisfaction from increasing
MISC	recent research  citation  has all but resolved the easterlin paradox by using log income  rather than raw income  to predict life satisfaction
MISC	the logarithmic transformation allows reflection of the non-linear utility of income
MISC	furthermore  deaton  citation  has used it to show that no satiation point exists beyond which increments in log income no longer contribute to an increase in life satisfaction
MISC	however  some questions remain unanswered
MISC	one of them  which the satisfaction treadmill touches upon  asks what encompasses people's mental representation of wealth
MISC	the researchers term this  the paradox of declining female happiness
MISC	sacred values are different from secular values in that they are often associated with violations of the cost-benefit logic of rational choice models
MISC	previous work on sacred values has been largely limited to religious or territorial conflicts deeply embedded in historical contexts
OWNX	our results suggest that depending on the prevalence of such values  incentive-focused negotiations may backfire
MISC	at least since the end of the second world war economic and foreign policy decision-making has been dominated by the  rational actor  perspective which assumes that decision-makers model the world on the basis of rational choice  cost-benefit  calculations that are commensurable across cultures  citation
MISC	although it is well accepted that decision makers often fail to make normatively rational choices  the assumption that they nonetheless are seeking to maximize utility dominates
MISC	for example  the makeup and performance of the principal forums for u s policy  citation  leaves little doubt that policy decisions should result from instrumental choices by goal-oriented political and economic actors
MISC	the official national security strategy of the united states explicitly states a commitment to  results-oriented planning  that focuses on  actions and results rather than rule-making   citation
MISC	recent work on  protected   citation  or  sacred   citation  values has challenged the presumption that issues under dispute in inter-group conflicts are fungible and can be valued along a common scale
MISC	this new body of research has emphasized that protagonists in disputes often invest values with transcendental qualities  citation  which affect decision-making
MISC	in sharp contrast with the rational actor perspective  subjects who viewed the issues under dispute as sacred values responded with greater outrage to deals with added material incentives to compromise those values
MISC	material incentives to compromise backfired presumably because they made salient the taboo against measuring commitment to sacred values along instrumental metrics
MISC	however  this paradoxical effect held only for people who treated the issue as a sacred value and not for those who saw the values as important but not sacred
MISC	the existing empirical work on sacred values has been focused predominantly on conflicts embedded in a complex historical contexts often marking the life and identity of several generations  citation   such as  dealing with issues such as sovereignty over jerusalem  gaza and the west bank  citation   conflict over the babri mosque in india  citation   and centuries old sharia law in indonesia  citation
MISC	yet  it seems possible that issues with a much narrower historical context can become sacred values  especially when they involve identity-related issues such as sovereignty
OWNX	in the research reported here  we investigate whether such values would also lead to judgments and decisions that would not be instrumentally rational
MISC	in the past few years  the iranian government has actively defended its right to having a nuclear program in part by framing the dispute as analogues to past historical events in which the advancement of the iranian nation was interrupted by foreign powers
MISC	specifically  the iranian government has made  a conscious effort to link the proliferation issue to the struggle for nationalization of oil half a century ago  a struggle that continues to strongly resonate with the iranian people   citation
MISC	by drawing parallels between these events  the nuclear dispute is essentially framed as an ongoing resistance with deep historical context
MISC	while the public discourse in the west about the iranian nuclear program is focused on risks  costs and benefits  the iranian position that they  will not retreat one iota   citation  and  will 'never ever' compromise on nuclear dispute   citation  is mainly in the domain of sacred rhetoric  citation
OWNX	this study investigates the amount and valence of information selected during single item evaluation
MISC	one hundred and thirty-five participants evaluated a cell phone by reading hypothetical customers reports
MISC	the participants who were given the customer reports only after they made a preliminary rating exhibited valence bias in their selection of customers reports
MISC	in contrast  the participants that did not make an initial rating sought subsequent information in a more balanced  albeit still selective  manner
MISC	the preliminary raters used the least amount of information in their final decision  resulting in faster decision times
MISC	yet  evidence suggests that biased processing of information frequently occurs during judgment and decision-making  citation
MISC	a number of studies have demonstrated that people use both selective exposure to information  citation   and selective processing  citation  to bias their judgments toward an early favorite  before the decision is made
MISC	in a series of recent experiments citation   matching subsidies generate significantly higher charity receipts than do theoretically equivalent rebate subsidies
MISC	some potential policy implications of isolation effects on charitable contributions are also considered
MISC	voluntary charitable contributions play a large and ever-increasing role in supporting the social infrastructure of developed economics
MISC	in an effort to find ways to encourage private contributions  experimental economists have  in recent years  devoted considerable attention to the effects of alternative fundraising formats and mechanisms
MISC	citation   one branch of this general program regards the effects of different methods for subsidizing contributions
MISC	a series of recent experiments  citation  indicate that matching subsidies elicit considerably higher charity receipts than do comparable rebate subsidies
MISC	table  number  illustrates the design used as the control treatment in davis  millner and reilly  citation   which is in many ways representative
MISC	subjects are asked to make a series of decisions to hold for themselves  or pass to a charity portions of an endowment in column  number  under the conditions shown in column  number 
MISC	the sum of hold and pass entries must sum to the endowment
OWNX	after making their choices  one randomly selected decision is implemented
MISC	for that decision  the subject receives as cash the amount they chose to hold supplemented by rebates of passed amounts in the rebate conditions
MISC	the amount passed supplemented by matching amounts in the matching conditions is sent to a designated charity
MISC	in general  a matching subsidy  s  reduces the effective price of contributing   number  to charity to p    number   number  s and a rebate subsidy  s  reduces the effective price of a   number  contribution to p    numbers
MISC	thus  s and s induce the same effective price when s   s  number -s
MISC	in addition to their control treatment  davis  millner and reilly  citation  report an  extra information  treatment where subjects received information prompting them about the net consequences of their choices
MISC	extra information only reduced  but did not eliminate significant differences in net charity receipts
MISC	the reason why changing subsidy formats so prominently affects charity receipts remains unclear
MISC	a failure on the part of subjects to understand the task at hand doubtfully drives results
MISC	eckel and grossman  citation   for example  observe that subjects strongly agreed with the statement that  instructions were clear
MISC	  using a  number -point likert scale  the mean subject response was  number   number 
MISC	one possible explanation for the higher charity receipts collected under a matching subsidy is that people find something psychologically appealing about matching subsidies
MISC	eckel and grossman  citation  suggest a sort of framing effect that might support such a preference for matching subsidies  the knowledge that the experimenter also contributes to the charity under a matching subsidy may create in subjects a  cooperation frame  that increases contributions relative to the  rewards frame  created by a rebate subsidy
MISC	at least some economists find this justification persuasive  citation
MISC	alternatively  isolation effects  discussed by mccaffery and baron  citation  may explain the higher charity receipts generated with matching subsidies
MISC	the notion of isolation effects  which is closely related to  but distinct from the well known concept of mental accounting  citation   suggests that when given a multi-dimensional problem  people tend to disaggregate dimensions of the problem and focus on only those components that they control most directly or that affect them most directly
MISC	for example  given the problems shown in table  number   people may focus on the direct consequences of giving away portions of their endowments  rather than on the indirect consequences for themselves or the charity that the various conditions imply
MISC	when asked to divide profits  subjects tended to allocate profits equally among partners  despite very unequal profit contributions
MISC	when asked to divide expenditures  subjects again tended to use an equal-division rule  even though this time the rule resulted in a very unequal division of profits
MISC	prompting subjects with information about the indirect consequences of their decisions reduced but did not eliminate the tendency to make equal allocations of the presented amounts
MISC	if people simply prefer matching subsidies  governments and fundraising organizations might do well to switch from away from rebate schemes and toward schemes that feature matching contributions
MISC	in particular  replacing tax rebates with a government-sponsored matching contributions program would increase charitable contributions   however  to the extent that isolation effects explain the higher charity receipts generated with matching subsidies  policy-makers may encounter difficulties in implementing such a program  and even if implemented  may not find that such a program increases charity receipts
MISC	both potential difficulties follow from what people may isolate on as direct effects
MISC	for example  attempting to replace tax rebates with a combination of matching contributions and higher taxes might be difficult politically  since people may focus on the direct negative consequences of a personal tax increase rather than on the more indirect positive consequences of increased charitable contributions
MISC	the potential importance of isolation effects in these contexts remains a subject for future investigation
MISC	the idea of the experiment is straightforward
MISC	in addition to a previously-reported control treatment  conducted using the design shown in table  number   i conduct a maximum possible contribution  mpc   treatment  where the allocation decisions are restructured so that the problem dimension presented most directly to subjects is the maximum amount that the charity may receive  rather than the maximum amount the subject may take home
MISC	although framing contributions in terms of charity receipts has few obvious parallels to natural contexts  it allows a clean distinction between simple preferences for matching subsides and isolation effects  to the extent that subjects simply prefer matching subsidies to rebates  matching subsidies will elicit higher net charity receipts than rebate subsidies in both the mpc and control treatments
MISC	on the other hand  to the extent that subjects isolate on the amount presented to be divided  net charity receipts under a matching subsidy will exceed those under a comparable rebate subsidy only in the control treatment
MISC	in the mpc treatment  charity receipts will increase equally with both rebate and matching subsidies  because subjects will divide maximum possible contributions between themselves and the charity in roughly the same way in all subsidy conditions
MISC	shifting the   direct effect of contributions from the amount of an endowment   to donate to the maximum amount charity may receive eliminates   the increased charity receipts elicited with matching subsidies   over rebate subsidies
MISC	by way of overview  experimental results are overwhelmingly consistent with isolation effects
OWNX	section  number  explains the experimental design and procedures used to evaluate this hypothesis
OWNX	section  number  presents experimental results
OWNX	a fourth section discusses some of potential policy implications of isolation effects on charity contributions
OWNX	we show  however  that a tendency towards a symmetric judgment pattern can be obtained by manipulating encoding conditions
MISC	sustaining attention during encoding experiment  number  or enhancing richness of the encoded stimuli experiment  number  increases judgment sensitivity in jod and yields biases in both directions jof biased by exposure duration   jod biased by presentation frequency
MISC	event frequency and duration are of fundamental importance in behavioral adaptation  citation
MISC	predators  for instance  increase their chances of survival if they approach areas where the prey resides more frequently and for longer periods of time
MISC	conversely  prey should strive to avoid areas where predators roam frequently and consistently
MISC	consider an individual who must decide where to go hunting  the probability of maximizing the individual's yield is a function of the frequency and length of time duration prey lingers in a certain area
MISC	assume the individual is an experienced hunter who has often visited different areas in the past and observed the behavior of the prey animals
MISC	further assume that the observations made would represent a valid sample of the prey animals' migrations
MISC	in order to properly adapt his own behavior to the environment  the hunter should use frequentistic and temporal information in his subsequent choice  citation
MISC	this requires two abilities  first  the individual must be capable of discriminating differences in frequency and duration  second  representations of frequency and duration must be stored in memory so that they can be used later for judgment and decision making
MISC	psychologists from various fields have studied processing of duration and frequency extensively
MISC	their approaches  however  differ
MISC	cognitive psychologists are often interested in memory processes  citation   whereas jdm researchers mainly consider judgmental heuristics  citation
MISC	these fields host different theoretical perspectives  apply different research paradigms and arrive at diverging interpretations of the phenomena
MISC	consider  for example  the case of frequency judgment
MISC	they explain their findings with reference to general models of memory  citation
MISC	conversely  jdm researchers often investigate factors that cause changes in judgment accuracy and explain their results with reference to judgmental heuristics  citation
OWNX	we compare judgments in two related domains  judgments of duration jod and judgments of frequency jof
OWNX	we manipulate conditions of encoding and assess their effects on judgmental patterns
OWNX	specifically  we compare jod and jof regarding differences in their retrospective sensitivity and differences in their susceptibility for biases
OWNX	with this approach  we seek to increase our knowledge of fundamental memory processes
MISC	such knowledge may help to achieve a better understanding of variations in judgment
OWNX	in the remainder of the introduction  we give a brief overview of the state of research on processing of frequency and duration and arrive at a working hypothesis regarding storage of these entities in memory
MISC	ample evidence indicates that organisms are remarkably good at discriminating differences in frequency and duration  citation
MISC	like animals  citation   adult humans  citation  and even young children  citation  are capable of effectively discriminating low range frequencies n  less than   number 
MISC	similarly  humans  like many other species  are able to discriminate temporal information across a wide range of intervals - from circadian timing to the timing of seconds and even milliseconds  citation
MISC	according to such a common-path hypothesis figure  number   frequency and duration would have commensurate effects on a stimulus' representation r and subsequent judgment  citation  for instance  they may both change the accessibility or strength of an event in memory
MISC	changes in strength could be modeled by different theoretical approaches to memory
MISC	in connectionist-network models  frequency and duration may be conceived to change the strength of associations among r  its features and other constituents in the network  citation
MISC	in multiple-trace models  citation   strength is primarily conceived as a function of the number of traces representing a stimulus or event  at least if encoding and response criteria are constant
MISC	other things being equal  trace number is assumed to increase as a function of encounter frequency
MISC	it may also increase as a function of duration because prolonged exposure may entail repetitive encoding of the event
MISC	regardless of the underlying mechanism  a common-path hypothesis assumes that the same property of memory is used in subsequent judgments
MISC	accordingly  jof and jod should be made through assessments of the strength of r in memory
MISC	one main prediction to be derived from such a common-path hypothesis is that jof and jod should be symmetrically biased
MISC	empirical evidence for the common-path hypothesis  however  is mixed
MISC	for example  when applying the availability heuristic  citation   an individual is thought to estimate a criterion by assessing the ease with which the stimulus stimuli can be rehearsed from memory
MISC	the fluency heuristic  citation  employs a similar process  the more fluently a stimulus is processed due to previous exposure  the higher the estimation of the criterion  citation
MISC	for example  williams and durso  citation  varied the duration of words  number   number    number    number  sec between subjects
MISC	specifically  the longer the category exemplars were shown in the presentation  the higher the estimated size of the category  and the higher the probability that exemplars could be reproduced in a free recall test
MISC	lewandowsky and smith  citation  found similar effects earlier
MISC	employing a within-subjects design  they varied exposure duration  number   number    number   number    number  sec and assessed the effects on frequency judgments and recall
MISC	both measures were positively correlated with exposure duration
MISC	similarily  jod were found to be systematically biased by frequency
MISC	ornstein  citation  showed that retrospective judgments of time intervals reflected the number of available events that filled the episode
MISC	taken together  these findings support the assumptions of a common-path hypothesis  because jof and jod seem to behave symmetrically with regard to biases
MISC	a conclusive test  however  requires us to consider two other aspects of the judgment pattern
MISC	one is the relative strength of the biases  the other is judgment sensitivity  judgment sensitivity refers to the degree to which experienced differences in duration and frequency can be reproduced in judgments
MISC	such an approach was applied earlier in memory research
MISC	after the presentation he asked participants to either judge the frequency with which each word occurred or the duration it was shown on an average trial
MISC	hintzman found that jof showed a remarkable sensitivity for actual differences in exposure repetition
MISC	conversely  judgment sensitivity was comparatively lower in jod
OWNX	as another difference  and already noted in the previous section  jod were systematically influenced biased by actual frequency
MISC	hintzman reported similar results in subsequent studies  citation
MISC	all together  empirical evidence from this line of research suggests that frequency and duration are stored differently in memory
MISC	duration biases on jof sometimes occur and sometimes do not
MISC	jod seem to be more susceptible to biases than jof  but there is also evidence for the opposite  citation
MISC	there are several possible explanations for the mixed evidence
MISC	an important one is that the type of judgment task differs between studies
MISC	as for jod  some studies use retrospective tasks  citation  and some use prospective tasks  citation
MISC	as for jof  most studies documenting duration biases on jof used set-size tasks
MISC	that is  participants estimated the size of categories containing different exemplars  citation
MISC	in contrast  duration biases on jof are less pronounced in tasks that assess judgment of event frequencies  citation
MISC	another possible explanation is that encoding conditions may differ across tasks and studies
MISC	encoding of frequency requires comparatively little attention to the stimulus
MISC	one must simply realize that the stimulus occurs
MISC	encoding of duration  however  requires that the individual additionally sustains attention to the stimulus for the entire period of its presence
MISC	in the literature on time perception  it is a widespread notion that attention is a crucial variable in time processing  citation
MISC	the present research focuses on the role of encoding conditions in jod and jof
OWNX	in three experiments  we varied total duration and frequency of stimuli orthogonally within the same experimental design
MISC	specifically  the presentation of the stimuli differed with regard to repetition frequency  number    number    number  times and the total summed duration they appeared on the screen  number    number    number  sec
MISC	following stimuli presentation  participants made jof and jod
MISC	it takes two dimensions into account - judgment sensitivity and biases
MISC	judgment sensitivity refers to the extent to which individuals are able to reproduce differences on stimulus dimensions in their judgments
MISC	biases are indicators for the type of memory representation underlying the judgment
OWNX	experiment  number  serves as a baseline study in which we did not control for encoding conditions
MISC	experiment  number  compares different types of stimulus formats that differ in likelihood of holding the observer's attention on the stimuli during encoding
OWNX	we examined the relation of cognitive reflection with performance in tasks that assess correspondence as distinct from coherence  such as predicting the ratings of chess players
OWNX	we found significant correlations between cognitive reflection and all the estimation measures in correspondence tasks
OWNX	we proposed that cognitive reflection is related to the concept of actively open-minded thinking  citation
MISC	humans often violate the tenets of rationality as ruled by logic  statistics  expected utility theory or other normative models of rational decision making  citation
MISC	instead of making decisions or judgments based on those models  humans tend to use heuristics that sometimes lead them to commit systematic errors or biases  citation
MISC	nonetheless  not all humans are biased  some of them perform as if they use normative models of rationality  citation
MISC	numerous studies have shown that adherence to normative principles and cognitive abilities or thinking dispositions are positively related  citation
MISC	this article aims to investigate the role of a thinking disposition - cognitive reflection - in decision making
MISC	frederick  citation  defined cognitive reflection as the  ability or disposition to resist reporting the response that first comes to mind  pp  number   and developed the cognitive reflection test crt in order to measure this thinking disposition
MISC	frederick also proposed a more general conception of cognitive reflection based on dual-system theories  citation
MISC	briefly  dual-system theories propose that humans have two cognitive systems  system  number 's processes are quick  effortless  intuitive and heuristic  and system  number 's processes are slow  effortful  reflective and rule-based
MISC	based on a default-interventionist conception of system  number   citation   frederick  citation  identified two characteristics of system  number  related to cognitive reflection  its capacity to monitor system  number 's outputs and its capacity to override system  number 's functioning
MISC	research has shown that individual differences in crt play a role in individual's decisions and judgments on tasks where their behavior could be compared to predictions of normative models  citation
MISC	those studies found that crt was positively related to choices predicted by expected utility theory  citation  in risky choice tasks
MISC	note  however  that frederick  citation  also found that  in the domain of gains  high crt scorers chose more risky options than low crt scorers even when the expected value of the risk option was lower than that of the safe option
MISC	furthermore  oechssler et al citation  found that high crt scorers were better than low crt scorers at avoiding logical fallacies and also they were less overconfident
MISC	or does it also measure a broader disposition such as actively open-minded thinking  citation   number  does general knowledge account for the influence of cognitive reflection on decision making
MISC	or does cognitive reflection influence decision making independently from general knowledge
MISC	correspondence tasks are those that test the correspondence of participants' estimations with facts of the world  citation
MISC	for example  participant's estimations of number of inhabitants in cities are compared to actual number of inhabitants in cities
MISC	the theoretical interest of correspondence tasks is that good performance in them is typically explained by participants' use of fast-and-frugal heuristics  citation  and not by adherence to normative principles
OWNX	as far as we are aware  the present study is the first one in relating cognitive reflection  as measured by crt  with correspondence decision-making tasks
MISC	previous research has shown that high crt scorers engage in heuristic behavior in tasks that investigate participants' judgments but not whether these judgments match facts of the world  citation
MISC	cokely and kelley  citation  found that high performance in crt was related to more elaborative heuristic search
OWNX	based on these results we predicted that cognitive reflection and performance would be positively related in correspondence tasks in which the use of heuristics is helpful
MISC	if this is the case  cognitive reflection  as measured by crt  would be a more general thinking disposition analogous to baron's  citation  concept of actively open-minded thinking
MISC	the third topic was concerned with alternative explanations of the role of crt in decision-making tasks
MISC	since crt positively correlates with different types of general knowledge - e g   numeracy  citation  and academic achievement  citation  - it could be argued that the relation between crt and decision making is explained by individual differences in general knowledge
MISC	participants decided whom of two patients to prioritize for surgery in three studies
MISC	differentiation and consolidation theory predicts that not only the attractiveness of facts but also the mental representations of objective facts themselves will be restructured in post-decision processes in support of a decision  citation
MISC	after the decision  participants were asked to reproduce the objective facts about the patients
OWNX	the consolidation process relied on facts initially favoring the non-chosen alternative and on facts rated as less  rather than more important
MISC	differentiation and consolidation  diff con  theory is a process theory of human decision making
MISC	it models decision making as a process involving different kinds of sub processes leading to a final decision  citation
MISC	according to the theory human decision makers structure and restructure both evaluations and facts about decision alternatives when they make a decision and after the decision
MISC	in the post-decision consolidation phase this process continues to strengthen the decision when afterthoughts and outcomes follow
MISC	the theory shares a process and attractiveness restructuring approach to decision making with a number of other models of human decision making  citation   some of which were reviewed by brownstein  citation  and by simon  snow and read  citation
MISC	empirical decision research has shown time after time that value attractiveness evaluation and diagnostic value of facts are restructured before and after a decision  supporting these theories  citation
MISC	that is  the chosen alternative is upgraded in attractiveness or in diagnostic value of evidence pro that alternative  citation   and or the non- chosen alternative is downgraded before and after a decision
MISC	however  there is a lack of empirical investigations of consolidation of facts in themselves
MISC	if a decision maker is given objective travel time e g    number  min as a fact of one alternative in a decision between two job offers  she or he may change the evaluation of this fact e g from  relaxing  to  boring  in the process of making a decision
OWNX	this evaluation does not mean that the quantitative facts representation must change
MISC	the decision maker should be able to communicate the exact travel time e g    number  min within a non-systematic random error even if there was an evaluative restructuring and no facts restructuring
MISC	the hindsight paradigm introduced by fischhoff  citation  uses a judgment approach that has some similarity with the present decision approach but with a focus on the post-event outcome phase
OWNX	they found that in general the quantitative distortions were in the direction of  we knew it all before  bias
MISC	they found that features with positive attractiveness were attributed comparatively more often to the chosen alternative than to the non-chosen alternative
MISC	when an alternative was assigned to participants  the memory attributions were less supportive of the assigned option than for an option that was chosen voluntary
MISC	this shows that the decision process had a selective effect on memories of evaluative features
MISC	gurkmankin levy and hershey  citation  had their participants make treatment choices yes or no concerning a medical treatment with side effects and a success rate of  number  percent 
MISC	however   since all patients are different he  the doctor  can't be certain that this is your probability   citation
MISC	this instruction communicated uncertainty about the probability fact that was used in distortions supporting a participant's choice
OWNX	instead of investigating qualitative evaluative features or uncertain probabilities  the present studies will investigate precise quantitative facts on well-defined attributes to find out if the facts are distorted in post-decision memory reproductions
MISC	if the hypothesis is confirmed  the sub-processes of the restructuring process will be investigated
MISC	one example is the subprocesses restructuring the mental representations of both the chosen and the non-chosen alternative
MISC	is the chosen alternative restructured to a greater extent than the non-chosen alternative
MISC	this is a new problem that has not been focused on in the past  since the attractiveness of facts or the diagnosticity of facts were in focus - not the facts in themselves
MISC	earlier studies of differentiation and consolidation have shown that attractiveness restructuring does not normally appear on the most important decisive attribute to support a choice
MISC	this was first reported by svenson and hill  citation  and later verified by salo and svenson  citation  in another real-life context
OWNX	we do not expect such drastic restructuring of facts  but according to diff con we predict no systematic changes on the most important decisive attribute but systematic changes of other attributes and in particular changes of facts supporting the non-chosen alternative
OWNX	we also want to introduce the visual analogue scale  vas  in a way that is new to decision process research
OWNX	we predict  number  that facts consolidation will restructure and distort the reproductions of quantitative facts in support of the chosen alternative   number  that quantitative facts restructuring will follow the same pattern as attractiveness restructuring and concern predominantly other attributes than the most important decisive attribute  and in particular conflict attributes   number  that facts restructuring can be achieved through changes of both the chosen increasing facts support and the non-chosen alternative weakening facts support for the non-chosen alternative
OWNX	we also want  number  to introduce facts presented on vas scales
MISC	the design will be balanced in order to control for response regression effects easily confounded with true restructuring processes depending on a prior decision
OWNX	in the first study  economics students serve as participants  and we use the vas  visual analogue scale  to present a medical vignette case
MISC	the second study replicates the first study with a group of participants who are familiar with medical problems and the vas
MISC	an important open problem is how values are compared to make simple choices
MISC	a natural hypothesis is that the brain carries out the computations associated with the value comparisons in a manner consistent with the drift diffusion model ddm  since this model has been able to account for a large amount of data in other domains
OWNX	we investigated the ability of four different versions of the ddm to explain the data in a real binary food choice task under conditions of high and low time pressure
OWNX	we found that a seven-parameter version of the ddm can account for the choice and reaction time data with high-accuracy  in both the high and low time pressure conditions
OWNX	the changes associated with the introduction of time pressure could be traced to changes in two key model parameters  the barrier height and the noise in the slope of the drift process
MISC	the drift diffusion model ddm is one of the cornerstones of modern psychology  citation  and  increasingly  of behavioral neuroscience  citation
MISC	the model has received increased attention over the last years for several reasons
MISC	second  the model is a special case of many of its competitors  which is a sign of its generality  citation
MISC	an important open problem in behavioral neuroscience is how the brain compares values to make simple choices
MISC	this problem is particularly interesting because there is ample evidence suggesting that the comparison process is not deterministic  and that it does not always choose the best option  citation
MISC	the success of the ddm in the realm of perceptual decision making has lead several groups in neuroeconomics to speculate that the same computational model might be used by the brain to make simple value based choices  citation
MISC	this type of choice refers to situations in which the brain chooses among several possible stimuli associated with different reward values at consumption e g   alternative food items by assigning a value to every item under consideration and comparing the values to select one of them
OWNX	furthermore  we also found that the changes associated with the introduction of time pressure could be traced to changes in two key model parameters  the barrier height and the noise in the slope of the drift process
MISC	understanding the conditions under which the ddm can explain the behavioral data in simple value based choice is important for several reasons
MISC	first  it is a necessary first step in exploring the extent to which this model can account for the underlying neural computations
MISC	second  since the ddm has been shown to provide an accurate description of data in other domains  the finding that the ddm also provides a good computational description of value-based choices provides insight into the nature of some basic algorithms that might be at work in many different psychological processes
MISC	a few studies have explored the ability of models related to the ddm to explain various common choice patterns
MISC	other studies have investigated the ability of the competing accumulator model to accomplish similar goals  citation

MISC	petersburg paradox is a famous economic and philosophical puzzle that has generated numerous conflicting explanations
OWNX	to shed empirical light on this phenomenon  we examined subjects' bids for one st
MISC	petersburg gamble with a real monetary payment
OWNX	we also examined bids offered for several hypothetical variants of the st
MISC	petersburg paradox
MISC	subjects following this strategy evaluate a gamble as if they were taking the median rather than the mean of the payoff distribution
OWNX	finally  we argue that the distribution of outcomes embodied in the st
OWNX	petersburg paradox is so divergent from the gaussian form that the statistical mean is a poor estimator of expected value  so that the expected value of the st
MISC	petersburg gamble is undefined
MISC	these results suggest that this classic paradox has a straightforward explanation rooted in the use of a statistical heuristic
OWNX	in the st
MISC	petersburg paradox  originally proposed in  number   the house offers to flip a coin until it comes up heads

OWNX	by conventional definitions  the st
MISC	petersburg gamble has an infinite expected value  nonetheless  most people share the intuition that they should not offer more than a few dollars to play
MISC	explaining why people offer such small sums to play a gamble with infinite expected value is an important question in economics and philosophy  citation
OWNX	the st
MISC	petersburg paradox has attracted explanations from many well-known thinkers  including daniel and niklaus bernoulli  cramer  de morgan  condorcet  euler  poisson  and gibbon  and economists including marschack  cournot  arrow  keynes  stigler  samuelson  von mises  ramsey and aumann  citation
OWNX	the earliest discussions of the st
MISC	petersburg paradox led to the idea of utility curves  now a central concept in economics  citation
MISC	moreover  menger's discussion of the paradox sparked von neumann's interest in utility  which in turn influenced von neumann and morgenstern's foundational book theory of games and economic behavior  citation
MISC	petersburg paradox  there is no widely accepted explanation for the low values most people place on this theoretically priceless gamble  citation
MISC	petersburg paradox  citation
OWNX	in the present study  we review several major classes of explanations  and then provide empirical data designed to test these explanations
MISC	diener and colleagues  citation  illustrated that individuals rely heavily on endings to evaluate the quality of a life
MISC	two studies investigated the potential for posthumous events to affect rated life quality  calling into question the intuitive  ending  of a life at death
MISC	undergraduates read a series of short life narratives to assess the consequences of posthumous reversals of fortune on judgments of the goodness and happiness of the life
MISC	in a  number x number  within-subjects design  lives positive and negative in valence were displayed twice  once from birth to death and once each life was followed by a posthumous event of opposite valence
OWNX	results demonstrated that posthumous reversals of fortune shift judgments of the goodness and happiness of the life in the direction of the valence of the posthumous event
MISC	these effects were not related to an individual's religiosity or the degree to which the life made an engaging story
OWNX	we suggest that the posthumous happy effect may be a case of a more general process  which we call retroactive re-evaluation
MISC	evaluative judgments of events are heavily influenced by the terminal event  a feature that kahneman and his colleagues encompass within what they call the peak-end effect  citation
MISC	when the sequence of events in question happens to be a life history  the sad reality is that death appears to be the end of the sequence
MISC	hence  lives by their nature have a negative ending
MISC	as well  because of the aging process  the positive peak in a life is usually well before the end  and the later years are often associated with a decline in competences  power  and influence
OWNX	these existential realities should bias life-evaluative judgments in a negative direction
AIMX	in this study  we explore this situation  and examine the degree to which this negative bias is minimized by incorporating lives into a larger framework that includes posthumous events
MISC	in the last decade  there has been a growing interest in understanding well-being  as evidenced by recent books  citation   and the development of appropriate measurement tools  citation
MISC	the positive psychology movement  citation   directed at optimizing the quality of life  has stimulated much of this work
MISC	quality of life lifetime subjective well being is a retrospective measure  as such  it suffers from distortions produced by memories of actual experiences  and in particular  a disproportionately high influence of the end state  citation
MISC	in a study asking participants to rate the goodness of lives based on brief life narratives  diener  wirtz and oishi  citation  showed that judgments of the quality of a life were heavily influenced by endings
MISC	the ending of a life is typically considered to be at death  however some aspects of a life  particularly those having to do with the life's meaning  can be affected by events that occur after a life is over
OWNX	in this regard  we note that most of the work on the end-effect has manipulated hedonic rather than meaningful events
MISC	one can understand that the quality of a life judgments might include posthumous events  but it seems unlikely that judged happiness of a life would be affected by posthumous events
OWNX	nonetheless  in this study  we included life happiness ratings as well as quality of life ratings
MISC	studies of end effects  particularly work by kahneman and his colleagues  typically involve a  hedonic  as opposed to  meaning  manipulation
MISC	it is reasonable to believe that changes in meaning are more likely to reflect significantly upon prior events
MISC	the religiosity of the participants was measured to examine whether shifts in judgments of life quality and perhaps happiness due to posthumous events are influenced by the strength of religious beliefs
MISC	many religions define a good life by the total number of a person's good works  which is not necessarily bounded by death
MISC	similarly  meaning in life  which is stressed by religions  over hedonism  can sometimes only be realized after the life is over
MISC	furthermore  to the extent that a person believes in an after-life  associated with many religions  the person might be able to  appreciate  the posthumous events
MISC	four lives  embedded within the other life stories  were designed to evaluate the effect of posthumous reversals of fortune
MISC	the life histories were presented in narratives  each a short paragraph  some of which included posthumous events that reversed the valence of the life ending
MISC	some people find it more difficult to delay rewards than others
MISC	in addition to demonstrating the reliability and validity of the future self-continuity index  these findings are consistent with the notion that increased future self-continuity might promote saving for the future
MISC	self-continuity represents one of the most enduring puzzles of personal identity  pondered by ancient greek and buddhist thinkers alike  citation
MISC	if the body changes over time - eventually being replaced by entirely new material - at what point does the old self become an entirely new and distinct being
MISC	self-continuity might vary by individual  with some individuals endorsing greater connection to their future selves than others
MISC	beyond philosophical appeal  individual differences in the experience of self-continuity could have pragmatic consequences for financial well-being
MISC	according to one philosophical account  citation   if individuals consider their future selves as different people  they may have no more reason to reward the future self than to give resources to strangers  citation
MISC	a continuous variant of this account called the  future self-continuity  hypothesis predicts that people who experience no continuity with a future self should not save for that future self  citation
MISC	accordingly  neural indices of future self-continuity predict valuation of future rewards assessed one week later  citation
MISC	physicians often encounter diagnostic problems with ambiguous and conflicting features
MISC	what are they likely to do in such situations
MISC	the scenario contained an ambiguous feature  while the other features supported either a cardiac or a musculoskeletal diagnosis
MISC	due to the risk of death  the cardiac diagnosis should be considered and managed appropriately
MISC	forty-seven participants  number  percent  gave only a musculoskeletal diagnosis and  number  of them managed the patient inappropriately sent him home with painkillers
MISC	they elicited less information and spent less time on the scenario than those who diagnosed a cardiac cause
MISC	most physicians indicated that they were fairly or very certain about their diagnosis
MISC	the role of coherence-based reasoning in medical diagnosis and diagnostic error needs to be systematically examined
MISC	the diagnosis of chest pain in primary care is notoriously difficult
MISC	the cause of the pain is usually not life threatening
MISC	however  conditions such as acute coronary syndrome and pulmonary embolism may be fatal if unrecognised and not promptly treated
MISC	there is evidence that myocardial infarction mi may be missed in primary care  citation
MISC	a missed mi is the commonest cause of negligence claims against primary care physicians in the usa and relates to more deaths than other conditions in claims against family physicians in the uk  citation
MISC	epidemiological studies have found that atypical presentations as well as patients attributing their symptoms to a non-cardiac cause are significant factors in missed diagnoses of mi  citation
OWNX	we studied the diagnosis of atypical chest pain using a simulated patient who attributes his pain to a pulled muscle
MISC	accounts of coherence-based reasoning describe how people deal with such situations and what they do in order to resolve the conflict
MISC	faced with equivocal  i e   non-diagnostic  information about two alternatives  people will spontaneously form a preference for one alternative and will distort information received subsequently so that it favors the preferred alternative  citation
MISC	they may even distort information that clearly favors one alternative  in order to preserve an earlier preference for the other alternative  though distortion generally declines as diagnosticity of information increases  citation
MISC	if preferences or judgments change as a result of new incoming information  distortion continues to operate  now in favor of the new preference or judgment  citation
MISC	it seems that distortion of information is a psychological necessity that helps individuals form and maintain coherent judgments
MISC	parallels with medical diagnosis can be drawn from studies of legal decision making
MISC	before seeing the case  participants had been asked to rate the diagnosticity of each piece of evidence  presented to them in unrelated vignettes describing various social situations
MISC	after they read and rendered their verdict on the legal case  participants were asked to rate the diagnosticity of each piece of evidence again  this time presented to them in the context of the case
MISC	its perceived diagnosticity thus increased in line with the verdict
MISC	the authors argue that a dna match should bear no relationship to the other pieces of evidence in the case  such as the reliability of an eyewitness' identification
MISC	  this basic experimental procedure has been repeated with several variations in order to test whether different factors affected coherence-based reasoning
MISC	this was attributed to an intense attempt to comprehend the complex material and represent it mentally in a coherent way
MISC	pre-decisional distortion of information has been investigated mostly with college students and with tasks that required no prior experience or technical skill
MISC	professionals or people with experience in a specific domain making judgments within their domain of expertise are rarely studied
MISC	in one such study  participants experienced in horse race betting evaluated task-related information chances of horses winning a simulated race in accordance with their final choice  either in anticipation of having to place a bet later or as a consequence of simply processing task information
MISC	they distorted information to a greater extent than participants without experience on betting on horses  citation
MISC	the diagnosis of chest pain in primary care lends itself to this type of enquiry
OWNX	we found that  across scenarios  experience was not related to diagnostic accuracy  which was predicted only by the number of critical cues elicited  i e   cues with diagnostic value for the relevant differential diagnoses
MISC	in recent years  numerous studies comparing intuition and deliberation have been published
MISC	however  relatively little is known about the cognitive processes underlying the two decision modes
OWNX	in two studies  we analyzed the effects of decision mode instructions on processes of information search and integration  using eye-tracking technology in a between-participants study  number  and a within-participants study  number  design
OWNX	our findings indicate that the instruction to deliberate does not necessarily lead to qualitatively different information processing compared to the instruction to decide intuitively
OWNX	we found no difference in mean fixation duration and the distribution of short  medium and long fixations
MISC	short fixations in particular prevailed under both decision mode instructions  while long fixations indicating a conscious and calculation-based information processing were rarely observed
MISC	instruction-induced deliberation led to a higher number of fixations  a more complete information search and more repeated information inspections
OWNX	we interpret our findings as support for the hypothesis that intuitive and deliberate decision modes share the same basic processes which are supplemented by additional operations in the deliberate decision mode
MISC	according to commonly-held assumptions  individuals sometimes make decisions deliberately and sometimes rely on their intuition or gut feeling
MISC	although a distinction between the two types of information processing is now widely accepted in judgment and decision making jdm research  citation   relatively little is known about the cognitive or affective processes that underlie them
MISC	different models that rely on automatic processes might be considered to account for intuition see glockner  and  witteman  in press  for an overview
MISC	these models range from mainly cognitive evidence accumulation  citation   sampling  citation  or network models  citation  to more affect-based approaches  citation
MISC	furthermore  many theories concern the interplay between intuitive and deliberate processes
MISC	a long tradition of dual-process models postulates a clear distinction between intuition and deliberation
MISC	as kahneman and frederick  citation  pointed out   dual-process models come in many flavors  but all distinguish cognitive operations that are quick and associative from others that are slow and rule-governed
MISC	 despite the apparent consensus regarding basic properties of intuition and deliberation  the dual-process framework has been criticized for being not sufficiently specified  citation
MISC	a second crucial critique concerns the fact that evidence for dual-process theories is predominantly based on outcome measures  while cognitive processes underlying intuition and deliberation were mainly neglected  citation
MISC	furthermore  theorizing on dual-process theories is inconsistent  and the wealth of models is hard to summarize according to simple criteria
MISC	one suggestion of categorizing dual-process models into three classes according to the interplay of the two decision modes was made by evans  citation
MISC	a first class of so-called pre-emptive theories is characterized by an initial selection between two rather distinct kinds of processes
MISC	for instance  mode selection models might be subsumed under this class  citation
MISC	a second class of theories denoted as parallel-competitive postulates a parallel activation of both processing modes and a kind of competition among them that might result in conflicting responses
MISC	this assumption is most strongly advocated by sloman  citation   and other authors hold this view as well  citation  or present consistent evidence  citation
MISC	a third class of theories  so-called default-interventionist models  citation   state that intuitive processes are always activated first as a default mode and deliberate processes may intervene upon these intuitive processes
MISC	evans  citation   for instance  assumes that heuristic processes generate default responses and analytic processes might intervene to scrutinize and potentially correct the initial response
MISC	in a similar vein  network models argue that automatic processes build the basis of every decision and are only supplemented by deliberate processes if necessary  citation
MISC	rather  they are seen as poles of a cognitive continuum  and task factors influence how far one moves toward one or the other pole
OWNX	we proceed as follows  first  we discuss dual-process theories with a special focus on whether they postulate more distinct or more integrated processes
OWNX	second  we describe probabilistic inference tasks and discuss related cue-weighting schemes
OWNX	third  we introduce the core eye-tracking measure  single fixation duration  which is used to investigate qualitative differences in information processing
OWNX	fourth  we derive hypotheses from both a distinct and an integrated processes perspective
AIMX	in this paper we investigate the claim that decisions from experience in which the features of lotteries are learned through a sampling process differ from decisions from description in which features of lotteries are explicitly described
MISC	a major thrust of behavioral decision research has been to identify situations in which people act boldly or timidly in the face of risk and uncertainty
MISC	in studies of decision under risk people choose between chance gambles with known probabilities and outcomes e g   receive   number  with probability  number  versus   number  for sure
MISC	these studies have found that people typically exhibit a fourfold pattern of risk attitudes  seeking risk for low-probability gains and high-probability losses e g   most prefer a  number  chance of   number  over   number  for sure and avoiding risk for high-probability gains and low-probability losses e g   most prefer   number  for sure over a  number  chance of   number   as predicted by prospect theory  citation
MISC	in studies of decision under uncertainty participants choose between prospects contingent on natural events e g   receive   number  if the home team wins versus   number  for sure
MISC	these studies don't generally lend themselves to analysis of  risk  attitudes because they rely on singular natural events for which there are no  objective  probabilities
MISC	however  when analyzed relative to judged probabilities  several studies reveal a similar pattern of risk-preferences  citation
MISC	for many decisions  potential outcomes are not known in advance but must be learned from experience
MISC	for instance  a commuter might choose a preferred route to work only after sampling alternative routes on several occasions
MISC	such experience-based decision making henceforth ebdm appears to reverse the fourfold pattern of risk attitudes of description-based decision making henceforth dbdm  with people avoiding risk for low-probability gains and high-probability losses and seeking risk for high-probability gains and low-probability losses  citation
MISC	on the basis of such results these authors have called for  two different theories of risky choice  hbwe  p  number 
MISC	the generalization that ebdm differs from dbdm is difficult to evaluate because  surprisingly  no one has yet defined  experience-based decision making
MISC	according to this definition ebdm applies to any situation in which there is uncertainty and learning through sampling
MISC	however  most of the data supporting the putative experience-description gap contrast a single dbdm paradigm decision under risk with minor variations of a single ebdm paradigm the hbwe design
MISC	note that decision under risk and the hbwe paradigm vary not only in terms of how information is learned explicit description versus sequential sampling but also what information is available to decision makers i e   information sampled from experience may diverge from information describing the corresponding objective probability distribution over outcomes
MISC	according to the information asymmetry hypothesis  the experience-description gap is driven by differences in information available to decision makers  and will diminish or disappear when such differences are eliminated
MISC	a key factor explaining this difference is that subjects in a stochastic pd game respond not just to what their counterparts did but also to whether or not they suffered a loss
MISC	these findings are interpreted in the context of behavioral theories of commitment  altruism and reciprocity
MISC	interdependent security ids games are social multi-player games with stochastic payoffs where each player must decide whether or not to mitigate her own risks
MISC	more specifically  each player knows that even if she fully protects herself by investing in a risk-reducing measure  she may still be subject to indirect losses by being  contaminated  by one of the other players who chose not to invest
MISC	as heal and kunreuther  citation  have shown  there are a wide variety of significant current problems that fit into an ids framework ranging from investing in airline or port security  protecting oneself against disease through vaccinations  individual users incurring software security costs when connected to a network  and divisions of firms undertaking risky investments that could cause the entire firm to become insolvent or bankrupt as in the current financial crisis
MISC	kunreuther and heal  citation  have shown that ids games can have either multiple nash equilibria or just a single nash equilibrium
MISC	in a nash equilibrium both players' strategies are the best response to each other's strategies  citation
MISC	if both players invest in a risk-reducing measure  there is no chance that either will suffer a loss
MISC	however  if either or both players do not invest in the protective measure  then there is some likelihood hence the stochastic part that both individuals will suffer a loss
MISC	this ids game can be viewed as a stochastic prisoner's dilemma spd game  an area of increased interest in experimental economics  citation
MISC	in the standard deterministic prisoner's dilemma game  two prisoners face the dilemma of testifying for the prosecution against each other and admitting their own crime  or remaining silent  the nash equilibrium strategy is for each prisoner to testify against each other even though both would be better off if they agreed to cooperate with each other by remaining silent
MISC	in an ids game  investing in a risk-mitigating measure is analogous to cooperating in the classic prisoner's dilemma game
MISC	subjects were randomly paired to play ten prisoner's dilemma games of their assigned type against each other  this is called a repeated prisoner's dilemma game or a supergame
MISC	in the deterministic prisoner's dilemma game  there is considerable evidence from controlled experiments that if players play repeated prisoner's dilemma games against each other  i e   a supergame  cooperation can emerge  even though they would be likely to defect in a single period game  citation
OWNX	each subject in our experiment played multiple  number - number  supergames of the same type i e   deterministic  stochastic full feedback or stochastic partial feedback with randomly chosen counterparts
OWNX	more details on our experimental design are provided in section  number 
OWNX	our interest in this research area is both substantive and methodological
MISC	in this partial feedback game  a player may or may not be able to infer her counterpart's action based on the payoffs received by both players  and so the ability to  pin the loss  on the counterpart may be obscured
MISC	behavior in a partial feedback game is of considerable interest today where each decision maker knows only what has happened to her but is unclear as to the cause
MISC	in such social dilemmas each individual receives a higher payoff for making a socially defecting choice e g polluting the environment than for pursuing a socially cooperative choice no matter what the other individuals in society do
MISC	furthermore  all individuals are better off if they all cooperate than if they all defect  citation
OWNX	there are several attractive features of utilizing bayesian hierarchical models for analyzing repeated prisoner's dilemma game experiments
MISC	they include the ability to perform exact small-sample inference where sample sizes are likely to be small  to incorporate within-person dependence with repeated-measures data  and to understand drivers of heterogeneity by tying in covariates of subjects and the context of their decisions to their individual-level parameters
MISC	these are classic advantages of bayesian methods  citation  and ones that are particularly salient and relevant to the analysis of repeated prisoner's dilemma game experiments
MISC	in a two person prisoner's dilemma game  individuals are much more likely to be cooperative when payoffs are deterministic the dpd game than in the spd games where the outcomes are stochastic
MISC	a key factor behind this difference is that subjects in the spd games respond not just to what their counterparts did  but also to whether or not they suffered a loss
MISC	when a person does not invest but his or her counterpart does  the individual is less likely to reciprocate the counterpart's investment in the next period if he or she does not suffer a loss
OWNX	however  we found that the pattern of cooperation was different in the two types of games
OWNX	section  number  provides a brief summary of theoretical and empirical studies on prisoners' and social dilemmas with a focus on recent experiments in a noisy or stochastic environment
OWNX	in section  number  we describe a general formulation for an interdependent security ids two-player game  showing under what conditions it takes the form of a stochastic prisoner's dilemma game

OWNX	in section  number   we build a bayesian hierarchical model that enables us to test hypotheses with respect to within-subject behavior
OWNX	section  number  summarizes the findings  discusses their prescriptive implications and suggests areas for future research
MISC	researchers typically use incentives such as money or course credit in order to obtain participants who engage in the specific behaviors of interest to the researcher
MISC	there is  however  little understanding or agreement on the effects of different types and levels of incentives used
MISC	some results in the domain of statistical reasoning suggest that performance differences - previously deemed theoretically important - may actually be due to differences in incentive types across studies  number  participants completed one of five variants of a statistical reasoning task  for which they received either course credit  flat fee payment  or performance-based payment incentives
MISC	performance on moderately difficult tasks compared to very easy and very hard tasks was most sensitive to incentives
MISC	these results can help resolve existing debates about inconsistent findings  guide more accurate comparisons across studies  and be applied beyond research settings
MISC	in the behavioral sciences  research participants typically must be provided with some type of incentive for their participation much like employees typically must be paid
MISC	although it has long been noted that the amount of incentive provided to animals can influence subsequent performance  citation   the use of research incentives for humans has been characterized by both inconsistencies across fields and controversy about effectiveness
MISC	the norm in psychological research is to tie research participation to course credit often as part of an introductory psychology course or occasionally some other form of set payment amount i e   a flat-fee
MISC	in contrast  the norm in economics research is to pay participants with money and to scale those payments to performance within the research i e   performance-based incentives
MISC	it has recently been noted that such discrepancies in methodology can have implications for cross-disciplinary variations in results and theoretical conclusions from research
MISC	retrospective reviews of past studies have made the case that there is a real issue regarding the effects of participant incentives  but they disagree on what these studies show  citation
MISC	camerer  and  hogarth  citation  focused on performance-based incentives and found little evidence for global improvements in performance  but more subtle effects of reduced variability in responses  reduced presentation effects  and perhaps performance improvements specifically in judgment tasks that are  responsive to better effort
MISC	  ortmann  and  colleagues  citation   found similar results as camerer  and  hogarth  but also found reason to be more optimistic about the effects of financial incentives
MISC	they concluded that  in the majority of cases where payments made a difference  they improved people's performance  p  number  and that  although payments do not guarantee optimal decisions  in many cases they bring decisions closer to the predictions of the normative models
MISC	moreover  and equally important  they can reduce data variability substantially  p  number 
MISC	two factors complicate this controversy
MISC	the first factor is the use of diverse behaviors on which the effects of incentives have been assessed  ranging from simple perceptual tasks  citation  to complex social coordination tasks  citation
MISC	tasks in which participants are already performing at or near their best are not likely to show much improvement  nor are tasks that are so difficult as to be beyond the participant's abilities
MISC	the second factor is the type of incentive used
MISC	when financial incentives are used in psychology they are typically flat-fee payments  which are more directly analogous to the non-financial course credit  payments  that are the norm in psychology  but both of these are very different - in terms of incentive structure - from performance-based financial incentives
MISC	it therefore remains unclear how different types of incentives do or do not systematically affect performance across different types of tasks and different levels of task difficulty
MISC	empathic responses  such as sympathy towards others  are a key ingredient in the decision to provide help to those in need
MISC	the determinants of empathic responses are usually thought to be the vividness  similarity  and proximity of the victim
MISC	however  recent research highlights the role that attention plays in the generation of feelings
OWNX	in two studies we found that sympathy responses were lower and reaction times were longer when targets were presented with distractors
MISC	in addition  online sympathy judgments that allow attentional focusing on a target lead to greater affective responses than judgments made from memory
OWNX	we conclude that attention is an ingredient in the generation of sympathy  and discuss implications for research on prosocial behaviour and the interaction between attention and emotions
MISC	the link between empathic responses and willingness to provide help to others has been the subject of recent research on emotional responses and prosocial behaviour
MISC	feelings such as empathy  sympathy  compassion  distress  pity  and even anticipated regret are typically involved in decisions to provide assistance or donate money to those in need  citation
MISC	given the prominent role of emotions in prosocial behaviour  research has begun to tackle the important question of what drives the generation of feelings relevant for helping others
MISC	slovic  citation  suggests a model by which mental images and attention are two vital precursors for emotional reactions towards others in distress
MISC	a direct consequence of this mechanism is that people are more likely to generate sympathetic responses when they are able to mentally imagine the victim
MISC	in fact  research on perspective taking  citation  supports this notion and shows that more empathic concern is generated for victims that are similar to the perceiver  citation
MISC	the predisposition to perceive groups of people as less unitary is closely connected to gestalt theories of perception  citation   an association which highlights that perceptual processes are closely related to other  more complex impression formation processes  citation
MISC	the purpose of the study was to examine recalled emotions and perceived risks induced by manipulation using a short videoclip that recalled the sounds of the alarms and the sights of the missile attacks during the war
MISC	before filling in the study questionnaire in  number   the experimental group watched a short videoclip recalling the events of the war
MISC	the control group did not watch the video before filling in the questionnaire
OWNX	using the data provided by questionnaires  we analyzed the effect of recalled emotions on perceived risks in two different regions in israel  the northern region  which was under missile attack daily during the war  and the central region  which was not under missile attacks
MISC	the current study emphasizes the effects of recalled emotion in the context of the  number  israel-lebanon war on perceived risks among those in the northern region who were under direct attack compared to those who were not directly exposed to the war
MISC	understanding people's responses to stressful events is crucial  not only when these events take place but also over time  since media-induced emotions can influence appraisals and decisions regarding public policies
MISC	the current study is based on a field study of the  citation  israel-lebanon war
MISC	many civilians were injured  some lost their homes  and  number  lost their lives
MISC	in effect  the region's economy was paralyzed  and most places of work remained closed
MISC	indeed  the war had an indirect impact upon the entire country
OWNX	in a  number  study  we examined the effects of the  number  israel-lebanon war on emotions and self-risk perceptions among civilians living in two regions  the north  which was under missile attack during the war  and the center  which was unaffected by the missiles  citation
OWNX	in the current study we compare the emotions and risk judgments of individuals made at that time  number  with the recalled emotions and risk perception of individuals from the same two regions  number  months later
OWNX	in addition  for one of the sub-groups in the  number  sample we used an experimental design that included a short videoclip recalling the sounds of the alarms and the sights of the missile attacks during the  number  war
MISC	participants in this group filled in a questionnaire about recalled emotions and future risk judgment after watching this videoclip
MISC	the group-diffusion effect is the tendency for people to judge themselves to be less likely to experience a negative outcome as the total number of people exposed to the threat increases - even when the probability of the outcome is explicitly presented  citation
OWNX	in experiment  number  we replicated this effect for two health threat scenarios using a variant of yamaguchi's original experimental paradigm
OWNX	we propose  therefore  that the group-diffusion effect is related to the ratio bias
MISC	both effects occur when people make risk or likelihood judgments based on information presented as a ratio
MISC	the difference is that the group-diffusion effect occurs when the denominator of the relevant ratio is more salient than the numerator  while the ratio bias occurs when the numerator is more salient than the denominator
MISC	in many situations  there is  safety in numbers
MISC	  a person in a group is less susceptible to a wide variety of threats than a person who is alone
MISC	consider  for example  a traveler who is walking in a strange city at night
MISC	if this person is in a group  he or she is probably less likely to get lost  less likely to be mugged  and more likely to receive help in the event that he or she twists an ankle
MISC	however  there are many other kinds of threats for which being part of a group makes no difference
MISC	imagine  for example  a traveler who eats at a local restaurant
MISC	if the food in the restaurant were found to be contaminated with e
MISC	coli  then the person would be just as likely to get sick after dining in a group as after dining alone
MISC	there is evidence  however  that people tend to confuse the latter type of situation with the former
MISC	that is  people sometimes perceive an illusory safety in numbers
OWNX	one of his scenarios  for example  read as follows
MISC	an infectious disease is prevalent in a foreign city
MISC	the disease comprises a fever and temperatures of over  number  degrees for more than a week together with severe diarrhea
MISC	although the death rate is not high  the disease has after-effects such as total hair loss
MISC	the city authorities are afraid of losing tourists from abroad and have kept the matter confidential
MISC	a group of  number  japanese tourists including yourself has arrived in the city and plan to stay for one week
MISC	how likely do you think it is that you will catch the disease if you stay as planned for one week
MISC	for each scenario  there was an alone condition in which the participant was exposed to the threat alone  you have arrived in the city    a small-group condition in which the participant was one of  number  people exposed  and a large-group condition in which anywhere from  number  to  number  million people were exposed  depending on the scenario
MISC	furthermore  the function relating group size to perceived risk was roughly logarithmic
MISC	there was a large drop in perceived risk from the alone to the small-group condition  with a smaller drop from the small-group to the large-group condition
MISC	yamaguchi  citation  referred to this as the group-diffusion effect and he proposed that it occurs because people use an interdependence heuristic
MISC	they apply the general rule that  i am safer in a larger group  even when group size is irrelevant
MISC	according to yamaguchi  the interdependence heuristic could have evolved as the cognitive concomitant of the motivational mechanisms that lead humans - and many other animals - to form and maintain social groups
MISC	individuals in groups are better able to fend off attacks  find mates  find or create shelter  and forage successfully
MISC	one replicated the basic effect in hong kong  citation
MISC	these results leave open the possibility - as yamaguchi himself pointed out - that culture might play a role in the group-diffusion effect
MISC	because both japan and hong kong are culturally more collectivist than the united states  citation   participants in those countries might be more attentive to the number of people exposed to a threat or be more likely to apply the interdependence heuristic  perhaps because of their greater sense of collective control as opposed to individual control  citation
MISC	it is important  therefore  to replicate the group-diffusion effect in an individualistic culture such as that of the united states
OWNX	consider two scenarios
MISC	in one   number  person is expected to be taken ill out of  number  people exposed to a virus
MISC	in the other   number  people are expected to be taken ill out of  number  people exposed
MISC	the probability that any individual will be taken ill is given by the ratio of the number of people expected to be affected to the number of people exposed  and of course the two probabilities in this example are the same  number   number     number   number     number  percent 
MISC	however  if people attend to and weight the number of people exposed the denominator of the fraction more than the number expected to be affected the numerator  then they would perceive lower risk when the number of people exposed is  number  than when it is  number 
MISC	people do not attend to and weight the denominator more than the numerator because it makes them feel safe
MISC	they attend to and weight it more because it is more attentionally salient
MISC	a potential problem with this idea is that there is considerable research on a phenomenon called the ratio bias that seems to show just the opposite
MISC	when reasoning about likelihoods based on ratios  people attend to and weight numerators more than denominators
MISC	for example  denes-raj and epstein  citation  asked people to choose between two gambles
MISC	surprisingly  many people preferred to select from the second bin  implying that they were focusing on the greater number of red jelly beans in that bin  citation
MISC	yamagishi  citation  has shown something similar in the domain of risk perception
MISC	his participants judged the riskiness of various causes of death when the death rates were presented as ratios  and they appeared to attend to and weight the numerators more than the denominators
MISC	for example  they judged the risk of dying of cancer to be greater when told that it kills  number   number  people out of  number   number  than when told that it kills  number   number  people out of  number 
MISC	i say the odds of winning a six-number lottery in which you choose the numbers are the same whether  number  or  number   number  tickets are sold
MISC	they say the chances are better if only  number  are sold
MISC	who's right
MISC	although the chances of winning are the same regardless of how many tickets are sold  the letter writer's family and friends appear to be influenced by that number - perhaps because it is the most salient one presented explicitly in the scenario
MISC	similar ideas have been explored by other researchers  although not in connection with the group-diffusion effect
MISC	for example  stone et al citation  speculated that the greater impact of certain graphical risk communication methods occurs because these graphical methods emphasize the number of people expected to be affected more than the number exposed
MISC	for example  a bar graph that compared the gum-disease risk associated with two brands of toothpaste in terms of the number of people expected to be affected produced relatively large differences in what people were willing to pay for the two products  citation
MISC	however  stone et al citation  found that a stacked bar graph that shows both the number expected to be affected and the total number who use each toothpaste produced much smaller differences on par with the differences produced by presenting the risks in terms of probabilities
MISC	bonner and newell  citation   however  found no effect of a conceptually similar manipulation
MISC	they presented people with information about various causes of death in terms of the number of people who die per day from that cause or the number who die per year
MISC	for example  the frequency of death from cancer in australia was presented as  number  deaths per day or as  number   number  deaths per year
MISC	in essence  these are ratios in which the number of deaths is the numerator and the time period is the denominator
MISC	these researchers also included a condition in which the number of deaths the numerator was made more salient e g     number  people in australia die every day from cancer
MISC	  and a condition in which the time frame the denominator was made more salient  every day in australia  number  people die from cancer
MISC	consistent with research on the ratio bias  they found that most people rated the causes of death riskier in the per-year condition than in the per-day condition - with a minority showing the opposite effect
MISC	the salience manipulation  however  had no effect
OWNX	we began our research by replicating the group-diffusion effect on college students in the united states with two health scenarios to be sure that it occurs with participants from a more individualistic culture
OWNX	we continued by replicating it again in experiment  number   but in a new context
OWNX	instead of health-threat scenarios  we used lottery scenarios in which participants had a chance to lose or win money
MISC	such a result would be consistent  however  with the idea that people simply attend to and weight the denominator of the relevant ratio more than the numerator
OWNX	in experiment  number   we show that the group-diffusion effect is eliminated when we change the scenarios slightly to include an explicit presentation of the numerator of the relevant ratio as well as the denominator
OWNX	finally  in experiment  number   we show that explicitly presenting the numerator but not the denominator produces an effect in the opposite direction - a ratio bias
OWNX	even among a group of people who choose to participate in a risk-taking activity  we find strong evidence of an economically significant omission bias   number  percent  of the mistakes at the table are caused by playing too conservatively  resulting in substantial monetary losses
MISC	this behavior is equally prevalent among large-stakes gamblers and does not change in the face of more complicated strategic decisions
MISC	much of modern economics is built on the premise that people maximize their expected utility for wealth when making decisions under uncertainty
MISC	in contrast  psychologists argue that people often act not so much to maximize their expected utility  but instead to minimize their expected regret - that is  people make choices to minimize their expected feeling of remorse when an action turns out badly compared to other alternatives  citation
MISC	in some decision environments  this can lead people to suboptimally favor inaction over action  inducing what is known as the omission bias  citation
MISC	inaction plays a salient role in a wide range of decisions
MISC	for example  people are reticent to vaccinate children with a potentially lethal vaccine  even when this risk pales in comparison to the incidence of death caused by the primary disease  citation
MISC	a staggering number of us households fail to rebalance their stock portfolios when it is optimal to do so  citation
MISC	many us workers under-participate in their retirement plans  despite the presence of employer-matching programs  citation
MISC	shoppers are often reluctant to make purchases when discounts are randomly offered in the market  citation
MISC	calibrating the impact of expected regret and the omission bias is challenging outside of an experimental setting because it requires parameterizing a complex set of beliefs and controlling for risk aversion
AIMX	in this paper  we study expected regret and the omission bias by analyzing actual play at a blackjack table in las vegas
OWNX	blackjack has two important features that make it attractive for this purpose
MISC	first  setting aside the issue of card counting  it is easy to categorize optimal play in every conceivable situation and document departures from optimal play in an unambiguous way
MISC	this is because there is a well-publicized solution to the game  known as the basic strategy  that has been widely accessible to card players since the  number s
MISC	indeed  many card playing guides offer steps for learning the basic strategy
MISC	second  and more importantly  blackjack players place bets in the game before they make strategic decisions
MISC	therefore  in all but a few situations  the bet is essentially a sunk cost once play begins  and the optimal strategy is independent of a player's level of risk aversion
MISC	this fact allows us to identify the role of regret avoidance and inaction  independent of risk aversion
MISC	the data consist of over  number   number  hands played in over  number   number  rounds of actual play in a las vegas casino
OWNX	the data for our study were obtained from a pilot study of the bally mp- number  card and chip recognition system  originally designed by mindplay intelligent games
MISC	the mp- number  system is optically based and tracks all bets and choices during play  capturing data in a covert and non-intrusive way
MISC	this allows us to record essential features of the game in a manner that leaves the natural play of the game is unaltered
OWNX	using this novel data source  we find strong evidence that an omission bias is present in the ex ante choices that card players make
MISC	when blackjack players make mistakes  they are four times more likely to make the error of failing to act than they are to make the error of taking an unnecessary i e   suboptimal action
MISC	the relevant null hypothesis of zero omission bias would have errors of commission and omission occurring in proportion to how often players were optimally required to stand or take a card under the basic strategy
MISC	the economic magnitude of the omission bias is large
MISC	in aggregate  players in single-hand deals who followed the basic strategy won  number   number  percent  of the time  very close to the theoretical win rate reported in blackjack guides
MISC	deviators won only  number   number  percent  of the time  which is statistically significantly lower
MISC	players that followed the basic strategy won a total of over   number   number   while they lost only about   number   number  following the basic strategy
MISC	in contrast  only   number   number  was won  and over   number   number  lost in hands that deviated from the basic strategy
MISC	of these  passive mistakes lost over   number  for every dollar won  while aggressive mistakes lost only about   number   number  for every dollar won
MISC	therefore  passive mistakes are not only more common  they are more costly
OWNX	we consider alternative explanations other than omission bias for the choices that we observe
MISC	the first explanation is that card counters are responsible for the deviations from basic strategy
OWNX	we should also note that this is probably an unlikely explanation since the win rates among basic strategy deviators are so low and the economic losses are so high
OWNX	the second is that limited cognitive ability is driving our results
MISC	indeed  it may be that some players find it difficult to remember the optimal choice in all situations
MISC	the idea here is that  if cognitive limitations make omission bias more prevalent  then it should be more pronounced among more difficult hands
OWNX	we find  though  that the omission bias is not more pronounced among hands in which higher order thinking is required
OWNX	to test this possibility we account for the position of the player at the table and the number of players seated at the table
OWNX	at large tables  we find no evidence that passive mistakes cluster disproportionately more among those who are high in the seat order at the table
MISC	they observed the complete history of play of  number  subjects in an amsterdam casino and conducted personal interviews of many of the players to learn their self-perceptions of how they make decisions
OWNX	while they collected a rich data set and provided many insights  our analysis is distinct in that we focus on the omission bias and alternative explanations of this result
MISC	the casino is indeed an opportune place to study other aspects of human behavior and decision making
MISC	sundali and croson  citation  studied the hot hand bias and the gambler's fallacy by analyzing videotapes of individuals who play roulette in a casino in reno  nevada
MISC	public entertainment has also been a convenient venue of study  though in many instances it is difficult to disentangle regret avoidance from risk aversion or cognitive limitations
MISC	the deviations are indeed consistent with an omission bias  risk aversion  and cognitive limitations  but determining which one is responsible for the observed behavior is generally difficult
OWNX	in section   we review the rules of blackjack  discuss the basic strategy  and describe the data that were collected and used in the analysis
OWNX	in section   we explore the main findings
MISC	experiments have suggested that decisions from experience differ from decisions from description
MISC	in experience-based decisions  the decision makers often fail to maximise their payoffs
MISC	previous authors have ascribed the effect of underweighting of rare outcomes to this deviation from maximisation
MISC	in the current experiment  decisions that bear small consequences are repeated hundreds of times  feedback on the consequence of each decision is provided immediately  and decision outcomes are accumulated
MISC	the participants have to learn about the outcome distributions through sampling  as they are not explicitly provided with prior information on the payoff structure
MISC	the current results suggest that the  hot stove effect  is stronger than suggested by previous research and is as important as the payoff variability effect and the effect of underweighting of rare outcomes in analysing decisions from experience in which the features of gambles must be learned through a sampling process
MISC	much attention has been given to the distinction between decisions from description and decisions from experience
MISC	in experience-based decisions  people experience difficulty in estimating and understanding uncertainty
MISC	erev and barron  citation  hypothesised that two main behavioural tendencies determine the effect of rare events on repeated decisions from experience
MISC	the first is a tendency to rely on small samples of past experiences  citation
MISC	this tendency leads to underweighting of rare events  as most samples are not likely to include the rare events
MISC	the second is a tendency to rely on recent experiences
MISC	when the information available to the decision makers dms is limited to the obtained payoffs  this tendency leads to the  hot stove effect   which implies overweighting of the worst outcomes
MISC	the hot stove effect was first introduced by mark twain with his observation that if a cat jumped on a hot stove  then she would never jump on a hot stove again
MISC	however  the cat would never jump even on a cold stove
MISC	coutu  citation  states that the hot stove effect is a fundamental problem of learning that reduces the dms' likelihood of repeating decisions that got them in trouble
MISC	the hot stove effect implies a bias against a risky alternative in binary experience-based decisions  citation
MISC	the bias is a product of the tendency to reproduce actions that have been successful and avoid recent actions that have led to poor outcomes
MISC	previous research on experience-based decisions has led to mixed conclusions with regard to the descriptive value of the hot stove effect
MISC	for example  one selection of h in problem  number  made the participants earn four points with probability  number   number  and zero point otherwise
MISC	the participants in their study were told that the experiments included many trials  and their goal in each trial t t  number       number  was to select click on one of the two unmarked buttons that appeared on the computer screen
MISC	the participants deviated from maximisation
MISC	table  number  shows the maximisation rate the overall proportion of h choices in each problem  for example  the overall proportion of h choices was  number   number  in problem  number 
MISC	in the data considered by erev and barron  citation   the tendency to rely on small samples appeared to be stronger than the hot stove effect
MISC	the clearest support for this conclusion came from problem  number   which used the clicking paradigm  where   number  the participants were asked to select between unlabelled buttons on the computer screen   number  each selection click led to a random draw from the payoff distribution associated with the different buttons  and  number  in choosing among possible options  the participants had to rely on the immediate feedback obtained in similar situations in the past
MISC	notice that in problem  number  the worst outcome  number  from h is also the rare outcome probability of  number   number 
MISC	in problem  number   reliance on small samples and the hot stove effect lead to contradicting predictions
MISC	reliance on small samples implies that the rare outcome  number  from h will be underweighted  this prediction implies that h will be preferred
MISC	the hot stove effect predicts the participants' learning that reduces their likelihood of repeating decisions  with which they have done poorly i e   getting burned on a hot stove in twain's example  and thus referring to earning the worst outcome from h
MISC	barron and erev  citation  and erev and barron  citation  reported that the observed proportion of h choices over  number  trials was  number   number 
MISC	their results suggest that the tendency to rely on small samples is stronger than the hot stove effect
MISC	follow-up studies demonstrated the descriptive value of the assumed tendency to rely on small samples  and of the hot stove effect
MISC	however  some of the recent results appear to question erev and barron's  citation  conclusions with regard to the relative magnitude of the two effects
MISC	review of erev and barron  citation  suggests that the clearest indications for underweighting of rare events come from studies that examine decisions from experience with complete feedback  citation
MISC	this design controls the hot stove effect with the provision of complete feedback
MISC	a different picture is  however  shown in studies that focus on decisions from experience with limited feedback  citation   the feedback is limited to the obtained payoff  and the foregone payoff the payoff from the unselected option is not presented
MISC	this verbal summary of the results is consistent with the predictions of the leading models in the choice prediction competition
MISC	for example  the best baseline model explorative sampler with recency in erev et al citation  predicts a h-rate of only  number   number  in problem  number 
MISC	note again that the hot stove effect implies a bias toward l the low variability option in problem  number  and  number 
MISC	often to the detriment of human decision making  people are prone to an impact bias when making affective forecasts  overestimating the emotional consequences of future events
MISC	the cognitive processes underlying the impact bias  and methods for correcting it  have been debated and warrant further exploration
OWNX	in the present investigation  we examined both individual differences and contextual variables associated with cognitive processing in affective forecasting for an election
MISC	results showed that the perceived importance of the event and working memory capacity were both associated with an increased impact bias for some participants  whereas retrieval interference had no relationship with bias
MISC	additionally  an experimental manipulation effectively reduced biased forecasts  particularly among participants who were most distracted thinking about peripheral life events
MISC	these findings have theoretical implications for understanding the impact bias  highlight the importance of individual differences in affective forecasting  and have ramifications for future decision making research
MISC	the possible functional role of the impact bias is discussed within the context of evolutionary psychology
MISC	benjamin franklin observed that the declaration of independence  doesn't guarantee happiness  only the pursuit of it
MISC	you have to catch up to it yourself   citation
MISC	life-altering decisions such as contemplating who to marry or which career to pursue require reasoned predictions regarding long-term emotional benefits
OWNX	when asked to make affective forecasts  people accurately predict the direction or valence of their emotional reactions but show surprisingly poor ability to predict the intensity and duration of their anticipated feelings  citation
MISC	more specifically  people generally overestimate the emotional impact of future events  a phenomenon termed the impact bias  citation
MISC	people expect endless despair in response to romantic breakups and enduring euphoria in response to winning the lottery  whereas reactions tend to be more fleeting than anticipated  citation
MISC	because people often make decisions based on their predicted emotional reactions  the impact bias leads to frequent errors in decision making  citation
MISC	affective forecasting research has highlighted the importance of assessing both predicted and actual emotional reactions  since one type of reaction cannot merely be taken as a proxy for the other
MISC	nonetheless  due to the difficulty of conducting biphasic investigations  researchers have often chosen to examine forecasts only  citation  or to use a between-group design  with predicted and actual reactions to an event measured across different samples  citation
MISC	only two have focused extensively on non-demographic individual difference variables  citation
MISC	past research and theory have implicated working memory capacity and proneness to retrieval interference as important individual difference variables that may influence biased forecasts
MISC	in the present investigation  a repeated-measures design was used to determine whether individual differences in cognitive processing influence predicted reactions  actual reactions  or both
MISC	to examine some of the beliefs and preferences that underlie this difference   number  participants assessed their likelihood of engaging in various risky activities relating to four different domains gambling  health  recreation  and social  and reported their perceptions of  number  probability of negative outcomes   number  severity of potential negative outcomes  and  number  enjoyment expected from the risky activities
MISC	perceptions of severity of potential outcomes was a partial mediator in the gambling and health domains
MISC	the genders did not differ in their propensity towards taking social risks
MISC	a fifth domain of activities associated with high potential payoffs and fixed minor costs was also assessed
OWNX	for example  for every  number   number  us drivers  men are three times as likely as women to be involved in fatal car accidents  citation
MISC	furthermore  similar differences are seen in a wide variety of other forms of accident statistics
MISC	male pedestrians in the uk are involved in accidents about  number  percent  more often than female pedestrians  and men die much more often from drowning or accidental poisoning throughout the western world  citation
MISC	thus  there seems little doubt that men must be engaging in more risky behaviors across a broad range of domains
MISC	despite its obvious practical importance  some key aspects of the psychological underpinnings of gender differences in risk taking have not been examined
OWNX	the present article seeks to shed new light on these underpinnings  by asking a substantial sample of college men and women to report various perceptions and preferences related to a wide range of risk-taking scenarios
MISC	the existence of gender differences in propensity to take risks has been documented in a large number of questionnaire and experimental studies
MISC	for example  a meta-analysis by byrnes  miller  and schafer  citation  reviewed over  number  papers on gender differences in risk perception
MISC	they concluded that the literature  clearly  indicated that  male participants are more likely to take risks than female participants  p  number 
MISC	recent work has begun to examine the generality and cognitive underpinnings of these differences in greater detail  citation
OWNX	in one important study that provides a backdrop for the present investigation  weber  blais  and betz  citation  assessed the risks that men and women perceived in behaviors spanning five different content domains financial  health safety  recreational  ethical  and social decisions
MISC	gender differences were found in four of the five domainssocial decision-making being the exceptionwith males perceiving less risk and indicating a greater likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors
MISC	similar gender differences have been found in these domains in a large german sample  citation
MISC	of interest  these authors also found great variability in an individual's willingness to engage in risk across domains  suggesting that risk taking is not simply the product of some general personality trait that promotes risk seeking
MISC	instead  individual and group differences are substantially due to differing perceptions of risk in different domains
MISC	for the most part  previous research has relied on a unitary and subject-defined notion of  risk  e g    how risky is the behavior or situation
MISC	a number of researchers have examined the role of various affect dimensions in determining overall perceptions of riskiness
MISC	slovic  citation  proposes that several psychological risk dimensions including dread  control  and knowledge contribute to perceived riskiness
MISC	follow-up research has shown the material as well as emotional factors also impact overall risk judgments  citation
MISC	  and a subjective valuation of that outcome  how bad would that be
MISC	thus  in common parlance a given behavior might be said to be riskier than another behavior if the former has more severe potential consequences  or if it has a higher risk of potential negative consequences  or both
MISC	past research shows that decomposing these elements can shed important light on individual and group differences in responses to risky situations
MISC	gurmankin levy and baron  citation  had subjects assess badness of unfortunate medical outcomes associated with a defined probability e g    number  percent  chance of loss of a big toe
OWNX	different groups men vs women  physicians vs non-physicians were differentially sensitive to probability as against severity
OWNX	the present article pursues a similar approach to explore the determinants of men's and women's willingness to engage in different risky activities
MISC	note that in the field of finance  where distribution of potential outcomes is obviously continuous  risk is often conceptualized as the variability of the returns offered by a choice
MISC	following that approach  some theorists have found it useful to conceive of people's generalized risk preferences in terms of how this variability affects an individual's disposition to choose an option  citation
MISC	  it would seem to be a reasonable simplification to view the potential negative outcomes as a unitary event  having a probability and some degree of un-desirability
OWNX	this approach will be followed here  although in the general discussion we will point out the potential for follow-up work that would consider risks involving more than a single discrete negative outcome
OWNX	alternatively  one may hypothesize that women assess as greater the probability of unfavorable outcomes  without projecting any stronger negative reactions to these outcomes than do men
MISC	while studies of gender effects in adult risk preferenceswith the exception of gurmankin levy and baron  citation have not addressed this issue  there is one study within the developmental literature that explored this question
MISC	hillier and morrongiello  citation  examined gender differences in perceptions involved in physical risk taking in children
MISC	the genders also differed in the factors that contributed to their overall risk judgments
MISC	boys' risk judgments were significantly predicted by their ratings of injury severity while girls' risk judgments were better predicted by their ratings of vulnerability to any type of injury
MISC	this suggests that girls may avoid risky situations with any likelihood of perceived injury and boys may avoid risky situations only if the possible perceived injuries are judged as being severe
MISC	as noted above  the literature with adults has not examined whether the genders differ in their evaluations of  number  the likelihood of potential negative outcomes and  number  their appraisals of the severity of these potential outcomes
MISC	in adults  either or both of these aspects of risk may mediate gender differences in engaging in  risky  behaviors
MISC	a third factor may also be responsible for the gender differences in propensity to engage in risky behaviors  the genders may differ in their estimates of the enjoyment offered by the activity  assuming that negative outcomes do not take place
MISC	using a risk-return framework  weber and colleagues have suggested that risky decision making can be seen as a trade-off between fear risk and hope expected returns
OWNX	to put it in simple terms  the present study asks  do women tend  for example  to engage in dangerous recreational activities less often because a they think the likelihood of injury is greater  b they think the severity of an injury  were it to occur  would be greater  and or c because they simply do not find the positive aspects of such activities as attractive as men do
MISC	a second aim was to explore an important category of choices popularly referred to as  taking a chance  that have not  to our knowledge  been examined in previous studies of individual differences in risk  decisions to engage or not engage in behaviors that offer a small probability of a large positive reward in return for some small but certain cost
MISC	an example is trying to be the  number th caller to a radio station in order to win a large sum of money
MISC	this type of scenario will be referred to as the  positive domain 
OWNX	if this is so  then women should also show less interest than men in options offering a low probability of positive reward
OWNX	we investigated how frequency and amount of punishment affect the decision making of iranian subjects
OWNX	in our first experiment  performing a computer-based persian version of the iowa gambling task igt  our subjects scored remarkably lower than their western counterparts
OWNX	in our second experiment  subjects did not differentiate between decks with the same frequency of punishment but with different punishment amounts
MISC	however  among decks with the same amount but different frequency of punishment  a significant preference was apparent towards decks with less frequency of punishment
MISC	our results differ from previous studies  indicating a different strategy in risky decision making among healthy adult iranian subjects  as they show low attention to the amount of punishment and are more concerned with the frequency of punishment
MISC	risky decision making rdm is defined as a cognitive process in which an individual chooses from available options according to her assessment of the value of reward and or punishment associated with choices
MISC	this assessment is based on the individual's previous experiences and obtained information about the possible outcomes of options
MISC	factors such as the amount and frequency of reward and punishment  the probability of their occurrence and the delay in their presentation  influence the more favorable choice for the subject  citation
MISC	various studies have shown that decision making is also affected by the emotional valence assigned to each option based on previous experiences  citation
MISC	when making a choice  a decision maker recognizes the current situation as analogous to some previous experience and draws inferences from her previous choices  citation
MISC	research on decision making  and in general psychology  can suffer greatly from focusing solely on subject populations from the same culture
MISC	due to the need to move from single population based models  citation  and also because of the rapid globalization of commerce  the influence of culture on decision making has become a topic of interest for both psychologists and economists
MISC	the influence of culture on probability judgments  risk perception and risk preference have been extensively explored by researchers in different fields  citation
MISC	in addition  they have found that these differences are not due to differences in attitudes towards risk  rather it is something about how risk is perceived and construed
MISC	social and cultural causes are known to leave traces and are reflected by a variety of cultural products  such as the proverbs in that cultural  citation
MISC	an iranian proverb  providing advice when choosing between short term and long term benefits  reads   a cash slap in the face is worth more than credit for halva
MISC	  this proverb recommends people to prefer an instant gratification even if it is a slap in the face  over a sweeter payoff paid sometime in the future
MISC	cultural products created over generations  responsible for storing and transmitting cultural wisdom  citation   as well as the current economic or political status of a nation affect different aspects of people's judgment and decision making
MISC	there have not been rigorous cross-cultural experiments focusing on decision making in middle-eastern cultures
OWNX	moreover  we investigate the effect of frequency in contrast to amount of reward and or punishment in rdm among iranians
OWNX	we close with a discussion about some potential reasons for some of these differences
MISC	five studies demonstrated that people selectively use general moral principles to rationalize preferred moral conclusions
MISC	in studies  number a and  number b  college students and community respondents were presented with variations on a traditional moral scenario that asked whether it was permissible to sacrifice one innocent man in order to save a greater number of people
MISC	political liberals  but not relatively more conservative participants  were more likely to endorse consequentialism when the victim had a stereotypically white american name than when the victim had a stereotypically black american name
MISC	study  number  found evidence suggesting participants believe that the moral principles they are endorsing are general in nature  when presented sequentially with both versions of the scenario  liberals again showed a bias in their judgments to the initial scenario  but demonstrated consistency thereafter
MISC	study  number  found conservatives were more likely to endorse the unintended killing of innocent civilians when iraqis civilians were killed than when americans civilians were killed  while liberals showed no significant effect
MISC	in study  number   participants primed with patriotism were more likely to endorse consequentialism when iraqi civilians were killed by american forces than were participants primed with multiculturalism
MISC	however  this was not the case when american civilians were killed by iraqi forces
MISC	implications for the role of reason in moral judgment are discussed
MISC	most people believe that harming innocent children is wrong  as is cheating on an exam or breaking a promise
MISC	more controversially  some people believe that abortion is wrong  that the death penalty is unjust  or that animals should not be killed and eaten
MISC	this has not only been pointed out by philosophers as a key component of moral beliefs  citation   but also confirmed by psychologists as an important feature of lay moral intuition  citation
MISC	however  a problem arises when defending moral judgments
MISC	these features make disagreement in the moral domain a tricky problem  citation
MISC	what individuals often do  however  is defend a specific moral judgment by appealing to a general moral principle
MISC	principles are defined as general rules that can guide judgment across a wide variety of situations  making moral judgments appear to be less like ad hoc preferences and more like rational facts
MISC	in moral reasoning  a principle serves as a first step toward drawing a specific conclusion
MISC	once there is agreement about a principle  assessing whether a specific moral claim is an instantiation of the principle is all that remains
MISC	of course  there has been significant debate within moral philosophy as to what principles should be endorsed  citation
MISC	one of the central debates in normative ethics has been between advocates of consequentialism and deontology
MISC	consequentialism holds that acts are morally right or wrong to the degree that they maximize good consequences
MISC	many deontologists  on the other hand  while accepting that consequences are important  believe that there are constraints against certain actions independent of their consequences - some acts are wrong in-and-of themselves
MISC	these constraints generally include duties and obligations such as injunctions not to break promises  not to lie  and not to harm innocent others
MISC	the debate between these two camps has generated a number of well-known thought experiments where the two broad principles are pitted against each other in one moral decision  citation
OWNX	adopting these scenarios for use in the laboratory  psychological research has suggested that lay persons find the distinction between consequentialist and deontological considerations meaningful  citation
MISC	this is consistent with a large body of evidence showing that reasoning processes are heavily influenced by motivational factors  and that people are flexible in the principles they apply to justify their decisions  citation
MISC	taxation policy is driven by many factors  including public opinion  but little research has examined the strength and stability of the public's taxation preferences
MISC	participants indicated how they would share a fixed tax burden between two individuals who earned different amounts of money  either by adjusting the amount of tax paid by the two individuals  or by adjusting the amount of post-tax income retained
OWNX	the units in which tax was described - amount of money or percentage tax rate - were manipulated orthogonally
MISC	however  there was also a clear interaction  for amounts  participants favored progressiveness significantly more when considering post-tax money retained rather than tax paid  for percentages  no such effect was found
MISC	progressiveness in tax is a topical issue
MISC	recently in the united states and united kingdom there has been a move to increase the progressiveness of taxation  one of u s president obama's campaign pledges was to increase the highest rate of income tax to just under  number  percent 
MISC	similarly  the united kingdom government has recently announced it will introduce a new higher tax band of  number  percent  for people earning over   xa number   number   number    number   number  a year
MISC	conversely  several countries  like russia  ukraine  and the baltic states  have in recent years introduced versions of flat taxes  where all citizens pay the same proportion of their income no matter what its absolute value
MISC	citation the structuring of income tax systems generally has multiple - often conflicting - goals
MISC	the most obvious goal is raising revenue to spend on public services  balancing the potential extra revenue taken by high tax rates with the disincentive to work and temptation to illegally evade taxes that high tax rates induce
MISC	another key potential of taxation is distributional  using  for example  utilitarian or egalitarian criteria to redistribute wealth between the rich and poor  citation
MISC	although the issue provokes strong opinions about the optimal progressiveness of a tax regime  one area that is often ignored is the extent to which the public believe progressive taxation is fair and appropriate  and the ways in which psychological mechanisms for representing fairness affect tax progressiveness preferences
MISC	existing data give a mixed picture
MISC	generally  when asked whether those on higher incomes should pay a higher marginal rate of tax  people agree  citation
MISC	however  people's progressiveness preferences appear to depend on the way in which questions are posed
MISC	for example  roberts  hite  and bradley  citation  found that when participants were asked abstract questions about progressiveness - in the form of  are progressive tax rates more or less fair than flat tax rates  - students with some tax education indicated strongly that progressive taxation was more fair  in line with other studies
MISC	however  when asked concrete questions - how much more tax somebody earning   number   number  should pay relative to somebody earning   number   number  - the same participants indicated a preference for flat taxes  in this case the dominant response being that the former should pay double
MISC	on the other hand  edlund  citation  showed that swedish taxpayers favored progressiveness for both abstract and concrete questions  a finding he attributed to swedes' better awareness of the welfare state and other provisions paid for by taxation
MISC	similarly  lewis  citation  found that participants who gave preferences for taxation at different incomes favored progressiveness
MISC	this inconsistency is perhaps not surprising given the large body of work that shows that preferences are often unstable  and the way in which options are framed can affect people's preferences in a large number of areas  citation
MISC	framing effects have been specifically found in tax preferences  citation
MISC	for example  mccaffery and baron  citation  demonstrated several framing effects in participants who chose tax regimes for different family situations
MISC	one intriguing finding of roberts et al citation  was that participants were less inconsistent between abstract and concrete questions when concrete questions were framed in terms of the amount of money left after tax rather than the amount of tax paid
MISC	furthermore  the authors note in passing that their pattern of results  indicates that changing the reference point from taxes to residual income produced a shift away from regressive taxes and toward flat and progressive taxes  p  number   although the assertion was not tested statistically
MISC	first  although asking people about the amount of tax that should be paid by people on different incomes seems the most direct way to assess preferences  asking people about money left after tax may be more grounded in people's experience of paying tax  and hence have a greater stability and validity  it is likely that people are more able to report how much money they take home after tax - not least because that amount appears on their bank statements - than the amount of money they pay in tax in a given month
MISC	second  psychological wellbeing appears to be associated with the - relative or absolute - amount of consumption that a person is able to do  or  crudely  the amount of money they have left after tax and other unavoidable drains on resources are met  citation
MISC	this suggests that attempts to determine people's preferences for taxation should use a frame in which residual income is foregrounded
MISC	the surface features of the task are similar to those used by roberts et al citation   using two taxpayers who have different gross incomes
MISC	however  the response method is different
MISC	   and then marking on a scale with labels of  the same amount    twice as much   and so on  which may bias people towards responding heuristically with  twice as much   the most available and justifiable ratio
MISC	the deliberation-without-attention effect occurs when better decisions are made when people experience a period of distraction before a decision than when they make decisions immediately or when they spend time reflecting on the alternatives
MISC	this effect has been explained  citation  by the claim that people engage in unconscious deliberation when distracted and that unconscious thought is better suited for complex decisions than conscious thought
MISC	experiments  number    number a  and  number b in this study included a dominant alternative and failed to find evidence for this effect
MISC	encouraging people not to think about complex decisions appears to be unwarranted
MISC	when making a complex decision such as which car to purchase  should one take time to carefully consider information about each alternative or should one review the information  stop thinking about it  and wait for the best alternative to become known
MISC	a benchmark prescriptive model of decision making  the weighted additive wadd strategy  citation   suggests several steps in making complex decisions   number  list important attributes   number  weigh each attribute   number  assess alternatives on all attributes   number  multiply alternatives' scores on each attribute with that attribute's weight   number  sum the products for each alternative  and  number  select the alternative with the greatest sum
MISC	unconscious thought theory  citation  proposes that conscious thought is incapable of following these steps in complex decisions because of its capacity limitations  but that unconscious thought is able to reach conclusions that are similar to the prescriptions of wadd
MISC	therefore  utt claims that for complex decisions it is best to encode all of the necessary information and then stop consciously thinking about the alternatives and let the unconscious arrive at a decision
MISC	evidence for utt's claim comes from a series of studies by dijksterhuis and colleagues
MISC	in these studies  participants are given positive and negative attributes of a few alternatives
MISC	after the information is presented  some participants are instructed to carefully consider the information that had been presented for a specified duration before deciding which alternative is the best
MISC	these three groups are referred to as the conscious thought  unconscious thought  and immediate groups  respectively
MISC	people are generally more likely to select the best alternative after unconscious thought than when these decisions and judgments are made immediately or after conscious thought  citation
MISC	this finding is referred to as the deliberation-without-attention effect
MISC	the deliberation-without-attention effect has been demonstrated with complex e g    number  attributes per alternative  but not simple e g    number  attributes per alternatives decisions  citation
MISC	this effect occurs only when participants are informed that they will be making a decision or judgment after some duration and not when they are given information with no goal  citation
MISC	furthermore  this effect disappears when participants are primed to think of themselves as powerful  citation
MISC	dijksterhuis and colleagues have also suggested that many decisions are made unconsciously  citation  and found evidence that people are more satisfied with decisions made after a period of unconscious thought  citation
MISC	because of the importance of the implications of these findings e g   that people should stop consciously deliberating complex decisions  others have attempted to replicate the deliberation-without-attention effect but found little supporting evidence
MISC	several studies have employed methods similar to dijksterhuis  citation  or dijksterhuis et al citation  and failed to find an advantage of unconscious thought  citation
MISC	payne  samper  bettman  and luce  citation  allowed some participants to consciously deliberate for as long as they needed and found that judgments made after self-paced conscious thought led to judgments at least as good as and sometimes better than judgments made after a period of unconscious thought
MISC	runnion  citation  asked participants to form an impression of four cars after the acquisition phase and found that those in the unconscious condition did not form better memory-based judgments of the best car than conscious deliberators
MISC	furthermore  gonzales-vallejo  lassiter  bellezza  and lindberg  citation  criticized utt for being inconsistent with findings in social and cognitive psychology and concluded clear evidence for the deliberation-without-attention effect is lacking because of problems with the dijksterhuis method
MISC	one criticism of the dijksterhuis method concerns the definition of the normatively best alternative  citation
MISC	dijksterhuis  citation  claims that the alternative with the most positive and fewest negative attributes is the best choice
MISC	car a has cupholders and a sunroof  but gets poor gas mileage  while car b has no cupholders or sunroof  but gets good gas mileage
MISC	car a has two positive and one negative attribute and car b has one positive and two negative attributes
MISC	according to dijksterhuis' definition of normativity  one should choose car a
MISC	however  a person who weighs gas mileage more than the sum of the weights for cupholders and sunroofs should select car b over car a
MISC	acker  citation  and newell et al citation  asked participants which attributes were important for their decisions so that normativity could be determined on an individual basis
MISC	to avoid the problems of attribute weighing  gonzales-vallejo et al citation  tested for the deliberation-without-attention effect using a dominant alternative
MISC	one alternative dominates another if it is better on at least one attribute and at least as good on every other attribute
MISC	for example  if what is good about car a is also present in car b  but car b also has at least one positive attribute not possessed by car a  then car b dominates car a
MISC	no matter how a person weighs attributes  it is irrational to select or judge as better a dominated alternative  citation
MISC	gonzales-vallejo et al citation  found that  after a period of distraction  participants could not select the dominant alternative more often than chance
MISC	however  all participants engaged in unconscious thought so performance could not be compared to immediate decisions or those after a period of conscious thought
MISC	despite the failed replications of the deliberation-without-attention effect  further tests are warranted
MISC	recent meta-analyses have reported mean effect sizes of g     number  in favor of unconscious thought when compared to conscious thought  citation  and g    number  in favor of unconscious thought when compared to both conscious thought and immediate judgments and decisions  citation
MISC	new findings continue to be published showing an advantage of unconscious thought over conscious thought
MISC	for example  dijksterhuis  bos  van der leij  and van baaren  citation  found that soccer experts are better at predicting the outcome of soccer matches after a period of unconscious thought than they are when making predictions immediately or after a period of conscious deliberation
MISC	furthermore  utt and supporting findings have influenced theories in applied areas such as job design george  in press
MISC	it is imperative that utt continue to be tested and supporting results continue to be replicated
MISC	in the current set of experiments  participants were given four alternatives  one of which dominated the others except in experiment  number 
MISC	experiment  number  compared simple and complex decisions made by participants after conscious and unconscious thought
MISC	the difference between judgments of the best and worst alternatives for participants who engaged in unconscious thought was compared with those of participants who engaged in conscious thought experiments  number a and  number b and those who made immediate judgments experiments  number a   number b  and  number 
MISC	utt predicts that participants who engage in unconscious thought will select the best car more often than chance and more often than those who engage in conscious thought experiment  number 
MISC	furthermore  participants who engage in unconscious thought will rate the best car significantly higher than the worst car  and this difference will be greater than the difference for those who engage in conscious thought experiments  number a and  number b or make immediate judgments experiments  number a   number b  and  number 
MISC	newell et al citation  suggest that if impressions about alternatives are formed during the presentation of attributes  there should be a recency effect  information presented later should have a greater impact on decisions than information presented earlier
MISC	recently it has been observed that different choices can be made about structurally identical risky decisions depending on whether information about outcomes and their probabilities is learned by description or from experience
MISC	current evidence is equivocal with respect to whether this choice  gap  is entirely an artefact of biased samples
MISC	the current experiment investigates whether a representational bias exists at the point of encoding by examining choice in light of decision makers' mental representations of the alternatives  measured with both verbal and nonverbal judgment probes
MISC	the choice gap  however  remained even when accounting for this judgment distortion and the effects of sampling bias
MISC	indeed  participants' estimation of the outcome distribution did not mediate their subsequent choice
MISC	it appears that experience-based choices may derive from a process that does not explicitly use probability information
MISC	in recent years a quickly growing literature has emerged contrasting two different formats of choice - description and experience - and the correspondence of decisions observed in each  citation
MISC	a decision from experience dfe is one where the possible outcomes and estimates of their probabilities are learned through integration of personal observation and feedback from the environment  citation
MISC	a typical example might be the decision from where to buy your morning coffee as you make your way to work
MISC	by contrast  a decision from description dfd is one where all possible outcomes and their probabilities are explicitly laid out from the outset  citation
MISC	surprisingly  recent evidence has found that the decisions made under these two different formats of choice diverge
MISC	in the description format  outcomes and their probabilities were completely specified in the form   choose between a   number  for certain  or b   number  with a probability of  number  percent   otherwise zero 
MISC	participants playing this description-based choice task tended to make decisions consistent with prospect theory's four-fold pattern of choice - risk-aversion for gains and risk-seeking for losses when probabilities were moderate or high  but risk-seeking for gains and risk-aversion for losses when probabilities were small  citation
MISC	for example   number  percent  of participants preferred the certain   number  in the decision above
MISC	participants were free to sample as often and in any order that they liked until they were ready to select one option to play from for real
MISC	for example  only  number  percent  of participants preferred the certain   number  in the decision above
MISC	this apparent description-experience  gap  led some to call for the development of separate and distinct theories of risky choice  citation
MISC	fox and hadar  citation   however  have argued that this conclusion is unwarranted in light of a reanalysis of the hertwig et al data
MISC	specifically  they found that prospect theory could satisfactorily account for the patterns of choice when based on participants' experienced distribution of outcomes  which  due to sampling  errors   was often different to the objective distribution from which the sampled outcomes derived
MISC	this issue has led investigators to employ a number of creative designs that have produced conflicting results  citation
MISC	fiedler et al citation   reviewed evidence for the utilization of a contingency inference strategy termed pseudocontingencies pcs
MISC	pcs have been obtained using a wide range of task settings and dependent measures
MISC	yet  the readiness with which decision makers rely on pcs is poorly understood
MISC	a computer simulation explored two potential sources of subjective validity of pcs
MISC	second  contingency inferences based on pcs and inferences based on cell frequencies are shown to partially agree across samples
MISC	accurate contingency assessment is a prerequisite to  explain the past  control the present and predict the future   citation
MISC	from an adaptive cognition perspective  assessing contingencies amounts to inferring the relationship between two variables in a population from a sample of observations drawn from that population  citation
MISC	if the task was to evaluate the relation between drinking one of two beverages  say red wine or beer  and developing a migraine or not  the contingency may be inferred from recalling instances of wine and beer consumption followed or not followed by a migraine
MISC	epistemologically  then  the contingency in a sample  or more precisely the specific contingency index used by the decision maker  is used as a proxy for the contingency in the general population of instances
MISC	for example  to the degree that for the last  number  instances of alcohol consumption the proportion of developing a migraine was higher after red wine than after beer  one might conclude that in general red wine is more conductive of migraine than beer
MISC	not only for the   x number  p index in this example but for most contingency indices this inference seems unproblematic  as the sign and size of the sample value are unbiased estimates of the population value  citation
MISC	what might be more problematic is the quality grade of the information required
MISC	virtually all traditional contingency indices require information about joint occurrences
MISC	in other words  for every instance in a sample it is necessary to know the levels of both variables
MISC	in the example  for every consumption instance one needs to be sure whether red wine or beer had been consumed and whether it was followed by a migraine or not
MISC	however  due to several factors  e g a delay between observing the variables or a large amount of variables to be considered  information about joint occurrences might not be available at the time of judgment  preventing the use of the common contingency indices
OWNX	in the remainder  we will discuss the validity of an alternative strategy for contingency inferences that is applicable even under such impoverished conditions  pseudocontingencies
OWNX	pcs denote using the skew greater numbers of one level than the other in the case of dichotomous variables in the sample base rates of a pair of variables to infer a contingency
OWNX	intriguingly  these sample base rates  skewed by the sampling process  enable pcs to successfully indicate moderate to strong population contingencies
MISC	as another consequence  strategies that  rely on joint occurrences mostly agree with the pcs' predictions across  samples
MISC	previous research demonstrates overestimation of rare events in judgment tasks  and underweighting of rare events in decisions from experience
MISC	the rest of the difference is consistent with two well established mechanisms  judgment error and the use of small samples in choice
MISC	studies of human reaction to low probability rare events reveal an interesting difference between judgment and decision-making in repeated settings
MISC	that is  the estimated probability of events that occur with probability below  number   number  tends to be higher than the objective probability  citation
MISC	on the other hand  decision-making from experience tends to reflect underweighting of insensitivity to rare events  citation
MISC	that is  decision-makers behave as if events that occur with probability below  number   number  occur with smaller probability than their objective probability
MISC	the apparent discrepancy is important in light of the two-stage choice model  citation  which assumes that choice can be predicted from estimated probabilities
MISC	the theory of planned behaviour  citation  is based on a utility framework  and the risk-as-feelings hypothesis  citation  is a feelings-based behavioural model
MISC	the results supported the tpb by emphasising the role of outcome-expectations in the construction of intentions  and the raf by showing the importance of affective subcomponents in attitudes
MISC	humans sometimes act in order to reach an outcome  and other times out of enjoyment for the activity itself
OWNX	this difference has been referred to as extrinsic vs intrinsic motivation  citation   incentives vs motivation  citation   and utilitarian vs hedonically driven behaviour  citation   and represents a general dichotomy between action as goal and action as mean towards a goal
MISC	there is often a conflict between the hedonic quality of the behaviour and its consequences
MISC	although hedonic qualities could be seen as a particular kind of behavioural consequence  the experiential part of such a displeasure is  by definition  in the present  whereas other behavioural outputs lie in the future
MISC	thus  one suggested underlying mechanism for the tension between behaviour and consequences is the fundamental difference in time perspective associated with ongoing activities and their consequences
MISC	it has been suggested that the need for self-regulation exists in most individuals due to an inconsistency between short- and long-term consequences of an option  citation
MISC	intertemporal discounting exemplifies one such failure to balance the subjective value of immediate to more distant goals  and a systematic devaluation of future as opposed to immediate outcomes  citation
MISC	several theoretical accounts may shed light on the difference between actions as goals or as means
MISC	meta-theories of human motivation  such as self-determination theory  citation  centre on motivational mechanisms  claiming that a set of basic motivational needs drive behaviour
MISC	the need for competence  autonomy  and belongingness are proposed as general behavioural driving forces  fairly independently of time-perspectives
MISC	the most socially accepted action is the default option  and complying with it may not be experienced as decision making
MISC	other theories focus on preventing factors  such as cognitive limitations
MISC	these authors  citation  circumvent the issue of time perspective indirectly  by showing how the intuitive  basic  and effortless experiential heuristic system for processing is faster than the intentional  reason-based  and effortful rational analytical system
MISC	the rapid processing of affective and immediate information may result in behaviour which is more inclined to follow the affective rather than the analytical system
MISC	there is ample evidence that intentions may be directed at activities just for the pleasure of it  with little consideration of the potential consequences  e g   smoking  heavy drinking  unsafe sex  hazardous driving  and unhealthy eating
OWNX	furthermore  we aimed at an empirical investigation of core predictors for behavioural intentions in decision making under ambivalence
MISC	decision ambivalence is here defined as perceived tension between the hedonic quality of the behaviour and its potential consequences in behavioural choices
OWNX	then  we present the outline and results of two empirical studies  investigating the predictive power of the models
OWNX	next  we discuss the findings in light of the theoretical frameworks and the reviewed literature
OWNX	we designed an experiment to test the robustness of dana  weber  and kuang's dwk   number  results
MISC	dwk observed that  when participants were given a  costless  way - the click of a button - to ignore the consequences of their actions on others' payoffs  they chose to remain ignorant and fair behavior diminished
OWNX	by implementing a double-blind experiment together with a design that controls for alternative explanations for the observed behavior  we confirmed dwk's findings
MISC	previous works have indicated that  although individuals often act altruistically  citation  they also engage in strategic ignorance and thus avoid situations where altruism might be expected or required of them  citation
MISC	despite this  costless  mechanism  half of the participants in their experiment chose strategic ignorance and  subsequently  selfish actions
MISC	in contrast  when participants' did not have a choice to remain ignorant  behavior was mostly altruistic
MISC	based on these data  dwk argue that the generosity observed in many experiments may not be due to a preference for a fair outcome  but may be a result of  people feeling compelled to give due to situational factors  while not really valuing the corresponding outcome  p  number 
MISC	indeed  dwk observed that  when the one-to-one mapping between actions and outcomes was relaxed  fair behavior diminished
MISC	in addition to a preference for strategic ignorance  there are alternative reasons for why subjects in their experiments may have chosen not to click the button remain ignorant and behaved selfishly
MISC	first  subjects may have perceived the click of a button as costly  not costless
MISC	an extra click requires an additional effort the click
MISC	secondly  the click may have been avoided because it generated a delay in consumption
MISC	in dwk's experiment  a participant who chooses to reveal the other's payoffs is forced to wait to learn about the other's earnings before being able to consume her own payoff
MISC	finally  and more importantly  it is possible that omission bias  citation  may have caused the curious results
MISC	indeed  one can reasonably expect more generosity in an experimental design where transparency is the default choice and its avoidance the  click  option
OWNX	we also implement a double-blind experiment to generate the most reliable environment to test participant's decisions
OWNX	interestingly  overall  our results confirm the results of data  weber  and  kuang
MISC	when survey respondents rate the quality of life qol associated with a health condition  they must not only evaluate the health condition itself  but must also interpret the meaning of the rating scale in order to assign a specific value
MISC	in particular  patients and non-patients often give very different ratings to health conditions  a discrepancy that raises questions about the objectivity of either groups' evaluations
OWNX	in addition  we found that the context of the rating task influences the way participants distinguish between mild and severe scenarios
MISC	imagine a patient who suffers from lung disease
MISC	on a scale of  number  to  number   what is her quality of life like
MISC	and how does her quality of life compare to that of a more severely ill patient  someone who suffers shortness of breath even in a resting state
MISC	a respondent in a health survey may find it extremely difficult to come up with a rating for a health description like this
MISC	surely the first person is much healthier than the second  but how much healthier
MISC	and how different would their quality of life be  number  points  number   number 
MISC	the specific numbers may seem quite arbitrary
MISC	because such tasks are subject to individual interpretation  the specific values assigned to a given health state may depend on who is doing the rating and the circumstances of the rating task  leaving much confusion for researchers and policy makers trying to make sense of the results
MISC	the uncertainty of health ratings is evident in the differences often observed between patients' and non-patients' ratings of health conditions  citation
MISC	patients typically rate their condition higher than non-patients  so explanations for the discrepancy often focus either on patients overvaluing their health condition or non-patients undervaluing it
MISC	however  the discrepancy between patients' and non-patients' ratings may actually reflect more complex perspective differences than a straightforward under- or over-valuing of health conditions by either group
MISC	kahneman and tversky's  citation  prospect theory suggests that an individual's reference point is critical in determining how he or she evaluates a given state
MISC	as gains or losses become more distant from the status quo  they have a diminishing effect on utility
MISC	in the case of health  small changes in health should produce a relatively steep change in quality of life qol  with proportionally smaller impact from larger changes in health
MISC	because patients and non-patients have a different status-quo reference point  they should have different perceptions of the same health condition
MISC	for a patient suffering from a moderately severe case of lung disease  a milder case of the same disease would represent a gain in health generating a steep improvement in qol  whereas a severe case of lung disease would represent a loss in health with a steep cost in qol
MISC	because increasing losses have a diminishing impact  the mild case would have a proportionally larger cost in qol than the more severe case
MISC	as figure  number  illustrates  the gain and loss framing and the diminishing-return characteristic of prospect theory predicts that patients may actually give worse ratings to severe conditions  and that patients should perceive a greater qol difference between mild and severe health conditions than do non-patients
MISC	if so  it may be too simplistic to say that patients overvalue  or non-patients undervalue  the health condition           another issue that may complicate interpretation of health state evaluations is that ratings may depend on the task context
MISC	when rating single items in isolation with no context about how it compares to alternatives  respondents tend to give noncommittal ratings somewhere in the middle of the scale  arguably to leave room on either side for unknown future items  citation
MISC	however  when multiple items are rated  respondents tend to spread the items somewhat evenly across the rating scale  citation   essentially using the items themselves to impose meaning onto the rating scale
MISC	these strategies suggest that people may be attending more to the relative position of the items than to the specific values associated with the scale
MISC	the evaluability hypothesis  citation  suggests that respondents may draw heavily on such inter-item comparisons  particularly when the relevant attributes for judgment are unfamiliar or difficult to evaluate
MISC	rather than dropping items somewhere in the middle for lack of more information  respondents can use the relative comparison between items to decide how to place the items on the scale
OWNX	other participants rated multiple scenarios presented together  each describing a different level of severity
OWNX	we predicted that items rated in the no context condition should be grouped closer to the center of the rating scale  with relatively small differences between the mild and severe scenarios
OWNX	we also predicted a greater effect of the rating context for patients than for non-patients
MISC	by virtue of their own experience  patients should bring some implicit context to the task that is largely unavailable to non-patients
MISC	patients are more likely to know something about the possible range of severity than do non-patients
OWNX	even when severity context is not provided explicitly by the task  we anticipated that patients would be able to draw on that information and make those comparisons on their own  attenuating the effect of the explicit information provided in the context condition
MISC	impaired decision behavior has been repeatedly observed in schizophrenia patients
OWNX	we investigated several cognitive mechanisms that might contribute to the jumping-to-conclusions bias jtc seen in schizophrenia patients  biases in information-gathering  information weighting and integration  and overconfidence  using the process tracing paradigm mouselab
MISC	mouselab allows for an in-depth exploration of various decision-making processes in a structured information environment
MISC	a total of  number  schizophrenia patients and  number  healthy controls participated in the experiment
MISC	choices of patients and controls both approximated a rational solution quite well  but patients showed more extreme confidence ratings
MISC	both groups mainly used weighted additive decision strategies for information integration and only a small proportion relied on simple heuristics
MISC	under high stress induced by affective valence plus time pressure  however  schizophrenia patients switched to equal weighting strategies  less valid cues and more valid ones were weighted equally
MISC	hasty decision-making is a hallmark feature of presently deluded schizophrenia patients
MISC	while jtc is somewhat aggravated among schizophrenia  citation  and sometimes also non-schizophrenia patients with acute persecutory delusions  citation   other studies have found this bias also in remitted paranoid schizophrenia patients  citation
MISC	recently  jtc has been found to correlate with delusion conviction  citation
MISC	a number of researchers ascribe jtc a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of delusions  that is  fixed false beliefs  citation
MISC	the chain of events usually strongly favours one of the jars
MISC	compared to both healthy and psychiatric controls  schizophrenia patients make early  premature and incautious decisions in  number - number  percent  of the cases i e   they decide after only one bead has been drawn
MISC	when presented with the entire available information all at once  group differences are abolished
MISC	others have found that this bias is not a result of impulsivity  citation
MISC	using an experimental variant of the  who wants to be a millionaire  quiz  patients with schizophrenia  irrespective of current delusional ideation  displayed a lowered decision-threshold  that is  they over-interpreted the available amount of evidence  citation
MISC	the precise nature of jtc is not entirely understood and under some circumstances enhanced ambiguity and multiple response options the bias may even be diminished or abolished  citation
MISC	jtc can be conceptualized in different ways
OWNX	for the present study  we used a task that assesses the data-gathering  confidence  and the information integration aspect of jtc in a single paradigm
MISC	jtc may not be a problem if it is rested on the most valid pieces of information  and indeed cognitive research has found that a subgroup of healthy subjects adopt a so-called take the best heuristic  citation  and that the application of this heuristic in some environments leads to good decisions  citation
MISC	although the beads task remains the gold standard to capture jtc  it does not shed light on this aspect of decision-making  as the sequence of events is pre-determined
MISC	moreover  the beads task estimates jtc on the basis of a single item  reducing its reliability
OWNX	a final aim was to investigate the impact of stress exerted by time-pressure and emotionally framed scenarios within-subjects
CONT	on the basis of the available literature we expected that patients with schizophrenia szs collect less h number  and particularly less valid h number  information  show a less systematic information search inspecting less valid information first h number   are over-confident in their judgments h number   and that these biases might be more pronounced under conditions of stress induced by time-pressure or affective framing of the task h number  compared to controls cps
MISC	researchers frequently argue that within-subjects designs should be avoided because they result in research hypotheses that are transparent to the subjects in the study
MISC	this conjecture was empirically tested by replicating several classic between-subjects experiments as within-subjects designs
MISC	in two additional experiments  psychology students were given the within-subjects versions of these studies and asked to guess what the researcher was hoping to find i e the research hypothesis  and members of the society for judgment and decision making sjdm were asked to predict how well students would perform this task
MISC	in the field of psychology  there is a long-standing controversy over the appropriate use of between- and within-subjects designs
MISC	within-subjects designs have greater power and less variability  but many researchers eschew their use for two reasons
MISC	second  some have argued that life is more similar to a between-subjects design  citation
MISC	therefore  between-subjects designs increase the generalizability of the experimental findings
MISC	however  others have argued that between-subjects designs pose their own risks
MISC	parducci  citation  and birnbaum  citation  contend that  particularly with subjective judgments  the between-subjects design should be abandoned because it results in the confounding of context and stimulus
MISC	the most famous demonstration of this principle was provided by birnbaum  citation   who showed that in a between-subjects design subjects rated the number  number  as being significantly larger than  number 
MISC	theoretically  in a between-subjects design  the two conditions are identical except for the manipulation of a single stimulus
OWNX	in this case  the stimulus to be manipulated was the number being rated   number  or  number 
MISC	however  birnbaum argues that subjective judgments cannot be made in isolation  they require a context
MISC	in a within-subjects design  the context is specified  the two or more conditions are compared to each other
MISC	in a between-subjects design  the subjects are left to construct their own context to evaluate the stimulus
MISC	when this is the case  it is very likely that different contexts will be invoked for different stimuli
MISC	in this example   number  is likely to bring to mind other single-digit numbers for comparison  thus leaving the impression that  number  is a relatively large number
MISC	in contrast   number  is likely to bring to mind other triple-digit numbers for comparison  leaving the impression that  number  is a relatively small number
MISC	thus  in a between-subjects design both the stimuli and the context vary between conditions  confounding the results
MISC	although the relative merits may be theoretically debated  what is more troubling is that hypotheses tested in these two designs often do not result in the same conclusions  citation
MISC	despite the concerns about using between-subjects designs to evaluate subjective judgments raised by birnbaum and others  it appears that the within-subjects design has fallen out of favor in many areas of psychology
MISC	in particular  within judgment and decision making there exist many findings supported almost exclusively by between-subjects data
MISC	examples include the hindsight bias  citation   research on reason-based choice  citation   availability  citation   support theory  citation  and many classic demonstrations of heuristics and biases  citation
MISC	researchers in these areas have frequently argued that between-subjects designs are more appropriate
MISC	one of the main reasons cited for the superiority of between-subjects designs is the belief that within-subjects designs are transparent  citation
MISC	although this appears to be a popular reason for rejecting the within-subjects design  this assertion has never been empirically tested
MISC	thus  this gap in the literature inspired the two specific aims of this research
MISC	the first aim was to determine if classic examples of between-subjects designs could be replicated using within-subjects designs
MISC	when people learn to make decisions from experience  a reasonable intuition is that additional relevant information should improve their performance
MISC	these conclusions are consistent with a standard reinforcement-learning mechanism that processes information about experienced and forgone rewards
MISC	when immediate temptations conflict with long-term aspirations  immediate temptations often prevail and important goals remain unfulfilled  citation
MISC	such failures of self-control are well documented in behavioral domains as diverse as dieting  smoking  and interpersonal conflict  citation
MISC	the ability to forego small immediate rewards in order to receive larger future rewards is viewed as a hallmark of effective self-control in both humans and animals  citation
MISC	these forgone outcomes are counterfactual rewards that could have been obtained had one made alternate choices
MISC	in a classic study of self-control in children  mischel  shoda  and rodriguez  citation  found that preschoolers' ability to forego immediate gratification e g   one cookie immediately in order to attain more valuable eventual outcomes e g   two cookies after a brief delay is predictive of a number of key competencies in adolescence
MISC	several studies suggest that the most effective strategy for delaying gratification is directing one's attention away from the reward-related stimuli during the waiting period  citation
MISC	specifically  children who direct their attention away from the smaller immediate reward are better able to forego short-term gains  allowing them to maximize long-term gains
MISC	the hot cool systems framework  citation  is one popular theory of performance in delay of gratification studies
MISC	according to this theory  one's level of self-control is dictated by interacting  hot  and  cool  systems
MISC	the hot system is fast  emotionally driven  and automatically triggered by reward-related stimuli
MISC	in contrast  the cool system is slow  reflective  and top-down-goal-driven
MISC	the interplay between these two systems can either undermine or support one's efforts to delay gratification
MISC	one criticism of previous self-control studies is that they involve explicit tradeoffs of intertemporal options that do not occur in real-life situations  citation
MISC	in these paradigms  participants are told explicitly when the larger  delayed rewards will be received
MISC	in the real world  people are rarely given explicit information about the long-term consequences of immediate actions  citation
MISC	for example  consider the conflict between short- and long-term goals facing the executive of an expanding firm
MISC	at each choice point  the executive can elect to continue investing in new equipment and training  thus increasing the firm's future output and boosting long-term profits  or the executive can instead cut costs in order to boost short-term profits  thus deferring the future benefits of the new investment
MISC	the executive's choices effectively influence the state of the environment  which affects future returns
MISC	here  the precise long-term consequences of the executive's choices are not known until future time points
MISC	the present work examines optimal long-term choice behavior in a dynamic task with recurring choices  providing a more realistic representation of many short- and long-term tradeoffs in daily life
MISC	whereas the explicit tradeoff paradigm treats choices as static  one-shot decisions  many real-world decisions are often informed by past outcomes and one's current situation is determined by past choices  citation
MISC	notably  an experimental paradigm proposed by herrnstein and colleagues  citation  affords examination of individuals' ability to maximize long-term rewards in dynamic choice environments
MISC	consider the task reward structure depicted in figure  number 
MISC	the state of the environment is defined by the number of long-term choices made over the last ten trials
MISC	making a larger proportion of long-term choices over time moves the current state of the environment rightwards on the horizontal axis  thus increasing the rewards for both choices
MISC	in this dynamic choice environment  maximizing long-term i e   global rewards requires forgoing larger immediate i e   local rewards guaranteed by the short-term option and continually making long-term choices
MISC	a growing literature has examined factors that bear on the decision-maker's ability to learn the reward-maximizing choice strategy in similar environments  citation
MISC	for example  an executive may be able to both observe the actual result of further investment and calculate the hypothetical cost savings that would have resulted from suspending investment
MISC	although the neural substrates of a signal representing foregone rewards  distinct from directly experienced rewards  have been identified in both humans  citation  and primates  citation   it is unclear how these reward signals combine to shape behavior
MISC	behavioral research in human decision making has yielded some insight into how knowledge of foregone rewards can affect choice behavior
MISC	in settings where rewards change over time  foregone rewards can support optimal choice when  chasing  foregone rewards is advantageous and likewise hinder optimal choice when  chasing  foregone rewards is disadvantageous
MISC	further  sensitivity to foregone rewards appears to diminish over time in repeated-choice settings  citation
MISC	the present work extends this research to dynamic decision-making environments
MISC	namely  rewards on the present trial are determined by one's recent history of choices
OWNX	to investigate this possibility  we manipulate information presented about foregone rewards after each choice in the laboratory task outlined above see figure  number 
MISC	for example  after a long-term choice  a participant might be shown the  number  points that were actually earned as well as the  number  points that could have been earned had the participant made the short-term choice
OWNX	to foreshadow our results  we find that inclusion of more information i e   about forgone payoffs makes it less likely that the decision-maker will maximize long-term returns
MISC	this result  which is surprising on the surface  is anticipated by a standard reinforcement learning  citation  mechanism that has a single information-processing stream  as opposed to separate hot and cool systems  citation
MISC	according to the hot cool systems view  citation   accentuating the greater immediate rewards associated with the short-term option should increase the hot system's control over choice  leading to consistent selection of the globally inferior short-term option
MISC	rl models learn from their interactions with the environment to maximize gains  making use of a reward signal that provides information about the  goodness  of actions
MISC	this framework has been used to model human decision-making behavior  citation  as well as firing patterns in dopaminergic neurons in primates  citation
OWNX	our rl model demonstrates that weighting of a fictive i e   forgone reward signal for the action not taken impedes exploration of the decision space  because  in tasks where short- and long-term rewards conflict  adequate exploration is necessary to reach the optimal choice strategy
MISC	in the absence of specialized hot and cool components  this associative account provides a simple account of choice behavior for this and related tasks
OWNX	we sought a manipulation that would demonstrate that foregone reward information systematically biases choice and does not merely overload participants with information  hindering optimal choice behavior
OWNX	to demonstrate this  we employ a control condition termed false foregone rewards false-fr
OWNX	in short  actual feedback for the chosen option is veridical  but information about the forgone option favors the long-term option locally
MISC	researchers rely on estimates using relative frequencies computed by aggregating data over observations
OWNX	we show that this approach creates conceptual problems  and may result in the confounding of explanatory variables or unstable estimates
OWNX	to circumvent these problems we propose using probability estimates obtained from statistical models-specifically mixed models for binary data-in the analysis of calibration
OWNX	we illustrate this methodology by re-analyzing data from a published study and comparing the results from this approach to those based on relative frequencies
MISC	the model-based estimates avoid problems with confounding variables and provided more precise estimates  resulting in better inferences
MISC	a specific property of the probability judgments-their calibration-has been accepted as the  common standard of validity  in the empirical literature  citation
MISC	judgments are said to be calibrated if p number  percent  of all events that are assigned a subjective probability of p materialize
MISC	often research in judgment and decision making requires comparison of multiple competing models
MISC	researchers invoke global measures such as the rate of correct predictions or the sum of squared or absolute deviations of the various models as part of this evaluation process
MISC	reliance on such measures hides the often very high level of agreement between the predictions of the various models and does not highlight properly the relative performance of the competing models in those critical cases where they make distinct predictions
OWNX	we use multidimensional scaling of these comparisons to map the competing models
MISC	the field of behavioral decision making is  to a large degree  phenomena driven
MISC	for example  every model of decision making under risk is expected to account for the classical allais paradox
MISC	when new models are proposed  researchers often justify them by a series of comparisons against the older models in the field
MISC	there are several approaches for testing decision models
MISC	in the context of axiomatic models  there is a focus on small subsets of problems judiciously chosen to be diagnostic and differentiate optimally between certain models  citation
MISC	an alternative approach is to compare the models' ability to predict decision behavior in a sample of problems that are sampled randomly from a well defined universe of problems  citation
MISC	in all these methods the researcher assembles a data set consisting of an array of n decision problems and m models
MISC	for each problem there is one empirical response decision  di  number  n  which can take one of many forms such as a binary choice  a probability of a choice pattern  a numerical value such as a probability estimate  a certainty equivalent  etc
MISC	  and a set of predictions di  number  n  generated by the various models
OWNX	for our purposes it is sufficient to say that most of them are based on some discrepancy function fd d between the responses and the predictions that summarizes discrepancies across all n decisions  and can be formulated to take its optimal desirable value in the case of n perfect predictions
MISC	thus  one can always rank and in some cases also scale models according to how close or distant they are from a perfect fit
MISC	they compared m    number  models and used several sets of parameters for models with free parameters such as cumulative prospect theory  citation
MISC	they also report percent correct prediction of majority choice and the percent agreement between all model pairs across the n    number  decision problems
MISC	a similar approach is used in several chapters in gigerenzer  todd  and the abc research group  citation
MISC	erev et al citation  analyzed three model contests  each using a different decision paradigm  with two problem sets n    number  in each set
OWNX	here we use them to model the patterns of information search  stopping and deciding in a simulated binary comparison judgment task
MISC	to the cognitive scientist individual differences in behavior can be both intriguing and annoying
OWNX	we are all familiar with the subjects in our experiments who  don't do what they are supposed to do
MISC	the field of judgment and decision making is no exception to the challenge of individual differences
MISC	as brighton and gigerenzer  citation  mention in passing  even a theory as important and influential as prospect theory  citation  typically predicts only  number  percent - number  percent  of decisions in two-alternative choice tasks  and many models do much worse
OWNX	how should we  as a field  treat these individual differences and the challenges they present for our models and theories
MISC	one emerging approach for tackling these issues is to use hierarchical bayesian methods to extend existing models  and apply them in principled ways to experimental and observational data  citation
MISC	this approach not only provide tools for interpreting individual differences  but also facilitates theory building by providing a model-based account of why individual differences might arise
MISC	taking existing successful models of cognition and embedding them within a hierarchical bayesian framework opens a vista of potential extensions and improvements to current modeling  because it provides a capability to model the rich structure of cognition in complicated settings
OWNX	to demonstrate the application of hierarchical bayesian methods to the modeling of heuristic decision-making  we use a standard experimental setup that requires subjects to make judgments about the relative magnitudes of two objects size  distance  fame  profitability  and so on
MISC	to perform these judgments it is often assumed that subjects search their memory  or external sources of information  for cues to help differentiate objects
MISC	for example  an inference about the relative size of two cities might be facilitated by cues indicating which of the two cities is a capital  has an airport  a university  and so on  citation
MISC	judgments are then determined by rules that use the presence or absence of cues to provide estimates of the desired criterion i e   number of inhabitants
MISC	such tasks  although apparently simple  incorporate several important features that need specification in theories and models that wish to describe how subjects perform them
OWNX	we present a classification methodology that jointly assigns to a decision maker a best-fitting decision strategy for a set of choice data as well as a best-fitting stochastic specification of that decision strategy
OWNX	our methodology utilizes normalized maximum likelihood as a model selection criterion to compare multiple  possibly non-nested  stochastic specifications of candidate strategies
MISC	within the decision making literature  there exist many interesting decision theories  both normative and descriptive  that are defined deterministically
MISC	these theories  hereafter termed decision strategies  are not defined in terms of random variables and therefore do not explicitly account for fluctuations in choice by a decision maker dm
MISC	yet  many researchers have observed that dms are not deterministically consistent in their observed choices across repeated comparisons of the same stimuli set or choice type  citation
MISC	this variability of choice does not disappear over repeated experimental sessions for the same subject  citation  nor can it be attributed entirely to random responses and or learning and experience effects  citation
MISC	many researchers have suggested different methods of incorporating a stochastic specification to deterministic decision strategies to accommodate variability of choice
MISC	this  trembling hand  stochastic specification assumes that a dm follows a single strategy imperfectly with some probability of incorrectly selecting a choice alternative that is not truly preferred  citation
MISC	other specifications  such as the class of thurstonian and fechnerian models  treat preference as deterministic and model choice by adding a random variable representing  noise   citation
MISC	another class of stochastic specifications are those that incorporate multiple decision strategies with choice modeled as a sampling process over a set of strategies  citation
MISC	there are  of course  many variations and combinations of the above specifications as well  citation
MISC	further complicating matters  the choice of which stochastic specification to use is not an innocuous one
OWNX	in this article  we present a new strategy classification framework that evaluates a set of candidate strategies over multiple types of stochastic specification
OWNX	we consider single strategy with  error  specifications as well as probabilistic mixtures of strategies  and  using modern model selection criteria  directly compare these different models to one another retaining the optimal strategy-specification pair for a set of observed choice data
OWNX	thus  our framework assigns not only the best-fitting strategyies to a dm's choices  but also a best-fitting stochastic specification
OWNX	we also apply our framework to an existing empirical data set collected to test the transitivity of preference axiom  citation
MISC	how can one carry out strategy classification via choice data
MISC	however  this  accordance rate  approach can lead to significant biases in strategy classification  citation
MISC	hilbig  citation  demonstrates how these practices can lead to theoretical confoundings and uninterpretable data
MISC	more recent approaches have leveraged statistical models to carry out strategy classification
MISC	broder and schiffer  citation  developed a methodology built on a binomial multinomial statistical framework that models dms as utilizing a single strategy with some fixed probability of making an  error 
MISC	this basic approach has been successfully applied to memory-based multiattribute choice  citation  and decision making under risk paradigms  citation
MISC	glockner  citation  generalizes this approach by incorporating any number of additional measures  such as decision time and confidence data  into the likelihood function to allow theories with identical predictions at the choice level to be distinguished  see also bergert and nosofsky  citation  and glockner  citation
MISC	to tackle the problem of dms following different stochastic specifications  loomes et al citation  adapted a non-nested likelihood ratio test  citation  to evaluate a set of candidate strategies under various stochastic specifications
MISC	in a comprehensive set of studies  they found that dms were best fit by a variety of stochastic specifications with a mixture specification of strategies consistent with expected utility yielding an excellent fit to many dms
MISC	the non-nested likelihood ratio test  however  is an asymptotic test that may lack statistical power when applied to small samples  citation
OWNX	in this article  we generalize the strategy classification framework of broder and schiffer  citation  by considering multiple stochastic specifications of decision strategies  including probabilistic mixtures of multiple strategies
OWNX	these specifications were chosen for their theoretical relevance to the tversky data set section  number  as well as to showcase the generality of our approach
MISC	normalized maximum likelihood is an information-theoretic model selection criteria which evaluates models based upon the ratio of a model's goodness-of-fit to its complexity  adhering to occam's razor by favoring the simplest model that provides a good account of the data
MISC	how many judgment and decision making jdm researchers have not claimed to be building on herbert simon's work
OWNX	for a prescriptive article we asked if it contributes to building a method that combines ideas of other methods such as heuristics and optimization models
OWNX	based on our subjective judgments we found that the proportion of integrative articles was  number  percent  of the prescriptive and  number  percent  of the descriptive articles
OWNX	we offer suggestions for achieving more integration of jdm theories
MISC	the article concludes with the thesis that although jdm researchers work under simon's spell  no one really knows what that spell is
MISC	after receiving his nobel prize in economics  daniel kahneman wrote that he and amos tversky  explored a territory herbert simon had defined and named-the psychology of bounded rationality  citation
MISC	gerd gigerenzer and another nobel laureate in economics  reinhard selten  claimed that by bounded rationality simon did not mean irrationality as in tversky and kahneman's heuristics-and-biases program or thaler's behavioral economics but instead  models that  use fast and frugal stopping rules for search  citation
MISC	some judgment and decision making jdm researchers side with one of these two seemingly contradictory interpretations of bounded rationality  others attempt to show that they are not really contradictory  and yet others suggest moving beyond trying to define bounded rationality
OWNX	one way or another  we researchers in jdm work under simon's spell
OWNX	in the next section we analyze writings of simon and other researchers about his work and identify two of his main goals for jdm
OWNX	in section  number  we return to simon's spell and claim that jdm researchers do not really know what it is
MISC	judgment and decision making research overwhelmingly uses null hypothesis significance testing as the basis for statistical inference
MISC	this article examines an alternative  bayesian approach which emphasizes the choice between two competing hypotheses and quantifies the balance of evidence provided by the data-one consequence of which is that experimental results may be taken to strongly favour the null hypothesis
AIMX	we apply a recently-developed  bayesian t-test  to existing studies of the anchoring effect in judgment  and examine how the change in approach affects both the tone of hypothesis testing and the substantive conclusions that one draws
OWNX	we compare the bayesian approach with fisherian and neyman-pearson testing  examining its relationship to conventional p-values  the influence of effect size  and the importance of prior beliefs about the likely state of nature
MISC	the results give a sense of how bayesian hypothesis testing might be applied to judgment and decision making research  and of both the advantages and challenges that a shift to this approach would entail
MISC	a low p-value is taken to indicate that the null hypothesis is unlikely to be true  either h is false or a very improbable event has occurred
MISC	nhst has many detractors  citation   and various approaches to inference have been offered as alternatives  including an increased focus on effect sizes and confidence intervals  citation   and greater emphasis on replicability  citation
MISC	perhaps the most comprehensive and radical alternative to nhst is the adoption of a bayesian approach to hypothesis testing  and a number of researchers have recently argued for a more widespread adoption of this approach  citation
MISC	while many judgment and decision making jdm researchers will be familiar with bayesian techniques for model fitting and parameter estimation  citation   hypothesis testing is overwhelmingly conducted in the nhst framework
MISC	this article begins by introducing bayesian hypothesis testing and applying it to existing work on judgment and decision making
MISC	the current work seeks to remedy this disparity by combining the advantages of work in decision research mouse-tracing paradigms with contingent information display and cognitive psychology eye-tracking paradigms from reading and scene perception
OWNX	in particular  we introduce a new decision moving-window paradigm that presents stimulus information contingent on eye fixations
OWNX	we provide data from the first application of this method to risky decision making  and show how it compares to basic eye-tracking and mouse-tracing methods
OWNX	we also enumerate the practical  theoretical  and analytic advantages this method offers above and beyond both mouse-tracing with occlusion and basic eye tracking of information without occlusion
MISC	decision researchers must often rely on outcome measures i e   choice  preference  etc
MISC	to infer how decisions are made by individuals
MISC	the advent of increased computing power  availability  and usability has allowed decision researchers to develop methods to examine underlying processes attention  information acquisition  deliberation  etc
MISC	rather than relying solely on observable outcomes
MISC	process-tracing paradigms such as information boards and mouse-tracing methods  citation   eye-tracking methods  citation   and verbal protocols  citation  have been utilized in decision research as mechanisms for capturing the decision process
MISC	the need to verify theoretical advances that specify how i e   process in addition to what i e   outcome has produced a great interest in tracing methods  citation
MISC	narrow self-interest is often used as a simplifying assumption when studying people making decisions in social contexts
MISC	nonetheless  people exhibit a wide range of different motivations when choosing unilaterally among interdependent outcomes
MISC	measuring the magnitude of the concern people have for others  sometimes called social value orientation svo  has been an interest of many social scientists for decades and several different measurement methods have been developed so far
OWNX	here we introduce a new measure of svo that has several advantages over existent methods
OWNX	we conclude with a brief discussion of the research streams that would benefit from a more sensitive and higher resolution measure of svo  and extend an invitation to others to use this new measure which is freely available
MISC	the assumption of narrow self-interest is central to rational choice theory
MISC	the postulate is that decision makers dms are concerned about maximizing their own material gain  indifferent to the payoffs of other dms around them
MISC	this is a simplifying assumption that yields a powerful framework to predict and explain human decision making behavior across a wide variety of domains
MISC	however there are reliable counterexamples demonstrating that dms' elicited preferences and choices are often influenced in part by the payoffs of other dms  thus challenging what some have termed the selfishness axiom  citation
MISC	studies on the motivations that underlie interdependent decision behavior have a long history and these motivations have been referred to by a variety of names  including  social preferences  social motives  other-regarding preferences  welfare tradeoff ratios  and social value orientation svo
MISC	as examples  a dm may endeavor to maximize her own payoff individualistic  maximize competitive or minimize inequality averse the difference between her own and the other person's payoff  or maximize joint payoffs prosocial
MISC	it is worth noting  however  that the assumption of narrow self-interest is itself a particular svo  namely a perfectly individualistic orientation
MISC	moreover considering a spectrum of different svos is not a challenge to rational choice theory per se  but rather the extension of a postulate in an effort to increase the theory's psychological realism and descriptive accuracy
MISC	svo has been found to affect cognitions and account for behavior across a range of interpersonal decision making contexts  specifically in the domain of negotiation settings  citation  and resource dilemmas  citation
MISC	svo has also been identified as a covariate  interacting with different emotional states and influencing the propensity to cooperate  citation
MISC	svos have even been identified in non-human primates  citation   indicating that some other species also show intrinsic preferences for prosocial behavior
MISC	several different measurement methods for quantifying variations in svo across individuals have been developed  citation
MISC	for instance  some measures yield only low-resolution output that lack sensitivity to important individual differences  providing at best a nominal categorization  citation
MISC	specifically  previous measures have not disentangled the orientation of joint gain maximization from the motivation to minimize the difference between outcomes
OWNX	although these two orientations are related in that they both indicate a deviation from individualism towards prosociality  they are substantially different motivations  which should be differentiated both theoretically and operationally
MISC	furthermore  social value orientation is a continuous construct  as it corresponds to the quantity of how much a dm is willing to sacrifice in order to make another dm better off or perhaps worse off
MISC	this quantification of interdependent utilities can be best represented on a continuous scale
OWNX	in our view  a method for assessing svo should yield high resolution output which makes it sensitive to inter- and intra-individual differences and facilitate comparisons thereof  be easy to use  be efficient  be able to detect the most prevalent svo individual differences  allow for an evaluation of rank orders of social preferences  and yield meaningful results for virtually all subjects
OWNX	amongst these criteria  we consider the demand for a high resolution measure which produces data on a continuous scale as crucial
OWNX	we introduce here a new measure of svo  which takes this conceptualization into account and allows for greater explanatory potential of svo through increased statistical power while also meeting the aforementioned psychometric criteria
MISC	this new method is referred to as the svo slider measure
MISC	it is a long known problem that the preferential publication of statistically significant results publication bias may lead to incorrect estimates of the true effects being investigated
MISC	even though other research areas e g   medicine  biology are aware of the problem  and have identified strong publication biases  researchers in judgment and decision making jdm largely ignore it
OWNX	we reanalyzed two current meta-analyses in this area
MISC	these findings suggest that a conclusions based on meta-analyses without reported tests of publication bias should be interpreted with caution and b publication policies and standard research practices should be revised to overcome the problem
MISC	in comparison to statistically non-significant results  a larger proportion of significant results overestimate the underlying population effect
MISC	it is a long known and repeatedly discussed problem  citation  that a preferential publication of significant studies will therefore lead to a literature that provides a false impression regarding the robustness and size of the effect in question
MISC	these samples consist of studies that are registered with drug licensing agencies  funding agencies and institutional review boards
MISC	several surveys compared the results of these registered studies with the data that were eventually published
MISC	a recent and particularly impressive example is the survey by turner et al citation
OWNX	the data base of this survey consists of  number  clinical trials on the effect of antidepressant agents that were registered with the food and drug administration fda in the united states
MISC	thirty-seven of these studies were eventually published
MISC	an additional  number  of these studies appeared in scientific journals but reported-in contradiction to the fda records-significant main outcomes in these studies  the dependent variables considered to be the most relevant were exchanged
MISC	the combined effect size of the registered studies was g   number 
MISC	in the published literature  however  this combined effect size was inflated to g   number 
MISC	in the field of psychology  surveys of this nature are rare  as individual studies and their results  in particular  are seldom documented in a systematic fashion
MISC	however  one survey did employ a similar procedure to assess publication biases  citation
MISC	of the studies with non-significant outcomes  however  only  number  percent  were submitted for publication
MISC	thus  there is strong evidence supporting the conclusion that publication biases affect scientific literature in several disciplines  citation  including psychology
MISC	this and the rarity of non-significant results give good reason to assume that publication biases do occur
OWNX	thus  the main question we pursue in this article is whether there is evidence for inflated estimates of effect sizes in the jdm literature that are caused by such biases
MISC	generally  publication biases pose a threat to the validity of the body of scientific knowledge represented in the literature
MISC	at the same time  meta-analyses provide the opportunity to gauge the extent of the problem
MISC	several methods have been developed that aim to assess whether a collection of effect sizes is affected by publication bias
MISC	in the areas of human medicine and biology  several examples of serious publication biases have been identified by using these methods to reanalyze published data  citation
MISC	however  in jdm and psychology as a whole this problem has been largely ignored
OWNX	in the following  we will first provide a brief overview of methods for the detection of publication biases
OWNX	then  we will use these methods to reanalyze in some detail one meta-analysis from the area of jdm
MISC	the history of judgment and decision making is defined by a trend toward increasingly nuanced explanations of the decision making process
MISC	recently  process models have become incredibly sophisticated  yet the tools available to directly test these models have not kept pace
MISC	these increasingly complex process models require increasingly complex process data by which they can be adequately tested
OWNX	we propose a new class of data collection that will facilitate evaluation of sophisticated process models
MISC	tracking mouse paths during a continuous response provides an implicit measure of the growth of preference that produces a choice-rather than the current practice of recording just the button press that indicates that choice itself
MISC	recent research in cognitive science  citation  has shown that cognitive processing can be revealed in these dynamic motor responses
MISC	the past few decades have seen a notable change in the level of analysis characterizing theories and models in decision making
MISC	generally  paramorphic models concerned largely with outcome prediction are giving way to computational models that focus on the processes assumed to produce these responses  citation
MISC	this focus on underlying cognitive processes has enabled explanations of paradoxes e g   decoy  compromise effects within unified frameworks  citation   rather than increasingly complex algebraic functions divorced from cognitive operations
MISC	this theoretical shift demands accompanying empirical methodologies in order to evaluate these more precisely specified process theories
MISC	for example  the tracking of information search or acquisition during decision tasks has developed from the use of information boards  citation  to mouse-tracking techniques  citation   to eye-tracking techniques  citation
MISC	other methods such as think-aloud protocols and response time analyses  citation  have been used  as have clever combinations of several methodologies together to provide converging evidence  citation
MISC	the shortcoming inherent in the  process-tracing  techniques identified above  citation  lies in their neglect of the dynamic nature of choice preferences
MISC	the process traced by mouse- and eye-tracking is one of information search  not the deliberation process itself that utilizes this information  verbal reports reflect a subject's perception of how they engaged the task  and are subject to demand characteristics  response times rt indicate how long a task takes  but not the nature of processing that occurs during that interval
MISC	that is not to say that these measures are always uninformative  many authors have fruitfully applied rt analyses for example to infer characteristics of the decision process  citation
MISC	however  traditional metrics generally fail to capture the notion that observed choices are the result of a dynamic process where evidence for various response choice alternatives may accumulate over the course of the task
MISC	rts specifically lack sufficient resolution to explore this dynamic evolution of preference in real time
MISC	this deficiency is quite serious given that the evidence accumulation assumption has received extensive theoretical treatment and neurophysiological support  citation
MISC	recently  a growing body of research in cognitive science  citation  has utilized a novel paradigm that compensates for the deficiency in current jdm methods identified above
MISC	the research on response dynamics captures the continuous  online processing of information as it is revealed in the subject's motor response
MISC	the basic paradigm involves simply recording the position of the mouse en route to the selection of an option in a decision task
MISC	therefore  one can measure properties of the response trajectory and draw inferences about the underlying mental processes
MISC	when choosing the safe gamble in the realm of gains  subjects proceeded very directly to that gamble
MISC	theoretically  these results support models that allow for momentary preference for one option during the task  but ultimate choice of the other option e g   dual-process models or sequential sampling models-a behavior that would not be captured with existing discrete response methods
OWNX	in the following demonstration study  we show another application to a traditional jdm task  the iowa gambling task
MISC	the iowa gambling task  citation  has traditionally been used to diagnose decision making deficits in individuals with neurological damage
MISC	subjects are presented with four decks of cards  each of which provides wins on every draw and occasional accompanying losses  but they have slightly different payout characteristics see figure  number 
MISC	typically  two decks hereafter a and b are considered  bad  decks  offering high rewards and high punishments that result in a net loss  whereas two other decks c and d are  good  decks with lower rewards but also lower  more infrequent punishments  citation   resulting in a net gain
MISC	these are  number  failure to consider systematic error and  number  neglect of global model fit
MISC	using adherence measures to evaluate competing models implicitly makes the unrealistic assumption that the error associated with the model predictions is entirely random
OWNX	by means of simple schematic examples  we show that failure to discriminate between systematic and random error seriously undermines this approach to model evaluation
MISC	second  approaches that treat random versus systematic error appropriately usually rely on relative model fit to infer which model or strategy most likely generated the data
MISC	however  the model comparatively yielding the best fit may still be invalid
MISC	the comparative evaluation of theories is an issue of fundamental importance in all sciences
MISC	although such tests can be constructed to differentiate between models experimentum crucis given that opposing predictions can be derived  citation   it is more common that their comparison proceeds more indirectly
MISC	specifically  underlying assumptions or predictions derived from each particular model are tested independently
MISC	over time  instances of confirmation and disconfirmation are accumulated for each model
MISC	according to the classical falsificationist logic  citation   a model that repeatedly fails relevant tests is eventually discarded
MISC	thereby  the question of which is the better theory or model is answered indirectly  in the long run  it is the model which makes testable and falsifiable predictions and endures critical tests of these
MISC	indeed  a typical variant is to conduct series of investigations which successively shed light on the determinants and or bounding conditions of certain effects or theories
MISC	however  discontent with testing properties of single models in isolation has been voiced
MISC	the line of argument can be summarized as follows  citation   it is problematic to test a specific hypothesis derived from a single model against the indefinite number of unspecified alternatives
MISC	one particular variant specific to jdm research is the strategy classification approach which attempts to identify the decision strategy an individual most likely used  citation
MISC	following the idea that people adaptively select from a set of strategies  citation   models are compared on the level of individual subjects and the superior model is retained as a description of how the decision maker proceeded
MISC	one major statistical and methodological challenge in judgment and decision making research is the reliable identification of individual decision strategies by selection of diagnostic tasks  that is  tasks for which predictions of the strategies differ sufficiently
OWNX	we suggest the euclidian diagnostic task selection edts method as a standardized solution for the problem
OWNX	according to edts  experimental tasks are selected that maximize the average difference between strategy predictions for any multidimensional prediction space
MISC	the advantage of edts is particularly large if only few dependent measures are considered
MISC	the identification of individuals' decision strategies has always challenged behavioral decision research
MISC	there are at least three traditional approaches
MISC	comparative model fitting in particular has gained popularity in recent judgment and decision making jdm research
OWNX	we suggest the euclidian diagnostic task selection edts method as a standardized solution
MISC	the aim of this article is to evaluate the contribution of process tracing data to the development and testing of models of judgment and decision making jdm
OWNX	after a brief introduction we first describe classic process tracing methods thinking aloud  mouselab  eye-tracking
OWNX	then we present a series of examples of how each of these techniques has made important contributions to the development and testing of process models of jdm
OWNX	we discuss the issue of large data volumes resulting from process tracing and remedies for handling those
MISC	theories of judgment and decision making jdm can be classified into two general types  formal  or as-if  models  which specify relationships between input task and context parameters and output jdm behavior  and process models  which in addition seek to model explanatory psychological mechanisms underlying such input-output relationships
MISC	within the formal modelling tradition theories are evaluated via analysis of their predictions concerning outcome judgments and decisions  and subsequent rigorous experimental tests of such predictions
MISC	alternative models are evaluated in terms of the testable predictions that distinguish them  citation
MISC	process models  on the other hand  can be tested and evaluated in terms of both jdm behavior and process tracing methods  which elicit and analyze observations of a range of verbal and nonverbal antecedents and concomitants of judgments and decisions
MISC	imagine you conduct a risky decision making experiment in which you observe choices and collect verbal protocols
MISC	you find that the choices conform to  say  prospect theory  citation   but the verbal protocol has only infrequent uses of what you coded as evidence for prospect theory e g   reference point setting  coding as gains or losses  probability
MISC	what would you conclude  that decision making conforms to prospect theory according to the choices  or that it fails to do so according to the verbal protocols
OWNX	we surmise that the protocols would be seen as a subordinate  a supplementary source of data in this case
MISC	they would tend to be dismissed  if inconsistent with the choice output
MISC	process data somehow seem to be a subordinate source of evidence
MISC	for models that aim at predicting outcomes as-if-models this is appropriate  but not for models that aim to explain both outcome and process process models
MISC	the priority of output data is based on a natural sequence of testing dependent variables  predicting choice data is a first criterion for any model  be it a process model or an as-if-model
MISC	but beyond this first step there is no reason to prefer outcome over process
MISC	rather  for process models process data should be equally important  because they are richer than input-output data and can provide important evidence of explanatory mechanisms  citation
MISC	an instructive example is the work of glockner and herbold  citation   who show that  although prospect theory is certainly a good as-if-model  its process assumptions have to be rejected in favor of alternative models
AIMX	in this paper we describe methods devised in the field of judgment and decision making jdm to enable the recording of traces of underlying processes and cognitive representations
OWNX	we will describe these methods on three dimensions  their theoretical contribution  their core methodology and their key results
MISC	the two most influential models in delay discounting research have been the exponential e and hyperbolic h models
OWNX	then we extend the method to similarly contrast different versions of the hyperboloid model
MISC	the arithmetic discounting model a  which is based on differences between present and future rewards rather than their ratios  may easily be made orthogonal to any other pair of models
MISC	however  the additional control over the correlation between different discount rate parameters may require the researcher to either restrict the range that those rate parameters can take  or to expand the range of times the participant must wait for future rewards
MISC	with few exceptions people prefer to receive a reward now rather than at a later date  people also prefer to receive larger rewards than smaller rewards
MISC	but when a choice is offered between a smaller reward now versus a larger reward later  then these two  rules  of behavior conflict
MISC	people must find some way of resolving the conflict to make their choice
MISC	firms must also choose between outcomes at different times in the future  or now
MISC	classical economics  accountancy  and finance all agree on a single normative method by which this should be done  which is to value all future gains in terms of their present value
MISC	if a sum of money p  the present value will grow to a future amount f following to a risk-free process of continuously compounded interest  then that p is said to be the present value of that future payment  and f is said to be discounted to p as continuous compounding is an exponential model of growth  the normative model is known as exponential discounting
MISC	however  people consistently depart from this normative model in two distinct ways
MISC	first  people are not exponential discounters  they discount more heavily than exponential in the short term  and or less heavily than exponential in the long term
MISC	an important implication of this  decreasing impatience  is that people will make inconsistent preference reversals simply due to the passage of time
MISC	researchers have suggested that the form of people's behavioral discounting is better modeled by hyperbolic discounting  citation   whose mathematics reflects the processes of simple interest  citation
MISC	the second departure is that people are far more likely to choose present payoffs relative to future payoffs than they should
MISC	therefore  the form of people's discounting is non-exponential  and the size of their discounting is unreasonable
MISC	it has also been found that the magnitude of p and f  not just their ratios  may affect people's choices  citation   a finding which is implied by killeen's  citation  additive utility model of discounting  and by arithmetic discounting  citation   a special case of killeen's model  in which the underlying behavioral model is underpinned by the analogy of the excess wages required for waiting for f  rather than by analogies of simple or compound interest
MISC	using simulation studies  navarro  pitt  and myung  citation  have shown how psychological models may be difficult to distinguish from each other  so that deciding which model better captures people's decision making remains equivocal despite the scrutiny of many empirical studies
MISC	exponential and hyperbolic models of delay discounting could be taken as one such intrinsically confusable pair-after all  how distinguishable can models of simple interest and compound interest really be
MISC	interestingly  navarro et al suggest that a good way to improve the separation between models is to improve the experimental design  which they achieve in their simulations of information integration models by noting that the models make different predictions if trials are added in which only visual or only auditory stimuli are presented
MISC	a similar purposeful approach is evident in glockner and betsch  citation  who search for decision tasks that are  diagnostic  between competing models of risky choice
MISC	navarro  myung  pitt and kim  citation  see part of their research agenda as encouraging researchers to explore the landscape of their  favorite computational model of cognition 
MISC	what is the role of recognition in consumer choice
MISC	the recognition heuristic rh proposes that in situations where recognition is correlated with a decision criterion  recognized objects will be chosen more often than unrecognized ones  regardless of any other relevant information available about the recognized object
MISC	past research has investigated this non-compensatory decision heuristic in inference
OWNX	here we report two experiments on preference using a naturalistic consumer choice task
MISC	specifically  additional information learned about recognized brand objects significantly affected choices
MISC	it appears that recognition is processed in a compensatory manner and combined with other attributes in preferential choice
OWNX	we tend to like what we know
MISC	but what precisely is the mechanism by which familiarity or recognition guides choice
MISC	this article asks whether choice is sometimes guided by a non-compensatory mechanism  the recognition heuristic rh
MISC	the rh has been primarily investigated in inferential choice domains  which is the larger city  frankfurt or koblenz
MISC	  and is a simple tool from the  adaptive tool-box  of human judgment and decision making proposed by gigerenzer  todd and the abc research group  citation
MISC	additionally  the rh was proposed to be most applicable in situations where knowledge is limited  that is  not all entities in the choice set are recognized  citation
MISC	there are various other domains in which recognition knowledge is limited and where choices depend on preferences rather than inferences
MISC	one obvious example is consumer choice
MISC	as everyone knows  firms invest huge sums of money in advertising
MISC	although many advertisements are informative  often their purpose is simply to increase brand awareness
MISC	the present study aims to investigate the exact role of brand recognition in consumer choice
MISC	more specifically  it aims to see whether under certain circumstances participants will rely on recognition as a choice strategy regardless of any other information they may have about the recognized well-known brand
MISC	for instance  when choosing between two brands of chocolate in which only one brand is recognized  participants may employ a simple heuristic and choose the recognized brand
MISC	alternatively  they may combine recognition with other information known about the brand  such as whether the manufacturer has a good or poor environmental record
MISC	the present research therefore extends past studies of the recognition heuristic into a new domain  preferential choice
MISC	inferences consistent with  recognition-based  decision-making may be drawn for various reasons other than recognition alone
MISC	one reason why such effects may not be observed more widely is the dependence of the effect on specific values for the validity of recognition and knowledge cues
OWNX	we show that both recognition and knowledge validity may vary as a function of the number of items recognized
MISC	investigations of the recognition heuristic rh typically involve participants making judgments about items about which they have limited knowledge  such as the relative sizes of cities in the usa
MISC	for example  a participant might be presented with the two cities san diego and san antonio and asked which is bigger
MISC	this is because items of larger size are more likely to be encountered  hence more likely to be recognized the recognition-magnitude correlation
MISC	recognizing one of the two items is thus a useful cue for choosing the recognized item
MISC	if both items are recognized  however  additional knowledge is needed to make the decision and such additional knowledge may be very limited
MISC	recognition-driven inference can give rise to the less-is-more effect lime  whereby individuals who recognize many of the items often perform worse than individuals who recognize fewer of the items  citation
MISC	the lime is a counter-intuitive finding  predicted to occur under given circumstances if the rh is applied  citation
MISC	the counter-intuitive nature of the lime prediction allows for a strong test of the rh and has been used as a rhetoric device to promote the heuristic  citation
MISC	evidence for the lime has also been observed empirically  citation  but  counter to this  failures to observe the effect have also been cited in attempts to refute the rh  citation
MISC	at least as originally introduced  a lime is a mathematical necessity given certain assumptions rather than a proof of recognition-based inference
MISC	nevertheless  the consensus appears to be that the observation of a lime implies that the recognition heuristic was employed  citation   and that the use of knowledge will dilute or reduce the size of the lime  citation
MISC	limes need not appear only when the rh is studied in isolation
MISC	they are also predicted by formal models of knowledge-based inference if those models exploit the recognition principle
MISC	gigerenzer and goldstein  citation  used the appearance of the effect as part of their comparison of five integration algorithms with the take the best ttb algorithm  citation
OWNX	however  as we will demonstrate  limes can be produced by knowledge-based decision-making processes which use neither recognition-driven inference nor the related speed-of-retrieval inference that schooler and hertwig  citation  have shown produces similar advantageous effects for moderate over lesser forgetting rates
MISC	previous results show that the weight functions and the observed violations of coalescing and stochastic dominance can be understood from a bayesian point of view
MISC	heuristics that allow fast evaluations and mimic a bayesian inference would be an evolutionary advantage  since they would give us an efficient way of making decisions
OWNX	it is a well known fact that humans make mistakes when presented with probabilistic problems
MISC	in the famous paradoxes of allais  citation  and ellsberg  citation   it was observed that  when faced with the choice between different gambles  people make their choices in a way that is not compatible with normative decision theory
MISC	several attempts to describe this behavior exist in the literature  including prospect theory  citation   cumulative prospect theory  citation   and a number of configural weighting models  citation
OWNX	all these models use the idea that  when analyzing probabilistic gambles  people alter the stated probabilistic values using a s-shaped weighting function wp and use these altered values in order to calculate which gamble would provide a maximum expected return
MISC	there are also models based on different approaches  as the decision by sampling model
MISC	decision by sampling proposes that people make their decision by making comparisons of attribute values remembered by them and it can describe many of the characteristics of human reasoning well  citation
MISC	recently  strong evidence has appeared indicating that the configural weighting models describe human behavior better than prospect theory
MISC	several tests have shown that people don't obey simple decision rules
MISC	this property is called coalescing of branches and it has been observed that it is not always respected  citation
MISC	stochastic dominance happens when there are two bets available and the possible gains of one of them are as good as the other one  with at least one possibility to gain more
MISC	per example  given the bets g   number   number   number     number   number   number  and g    number   number   number     number   number   number     number   number   number   g  clearly dominates g  since the first outcome is the same and the second outcome in g is split into two possibilities in g   returning the same or more than g  depending on luck
MISC	since rank-dependent models  as prospect theory and cumulative prospect theory obey both stochastic dominance and coalescing of branches  configural weight models  that can predict those violations  are probably a better description of real behavior
MISC	in the configural weight models  each branch of a bet is given a different weight  so that the branches with worst outcome will be given more weight by the decider
MISC	this allows those basic principles to be violated
MISC	until recently  the reason why humans make these mistakes was still not completely clear
MISC	evolutionary psychologists have suggested that it makes no sense that humans would have a module in their brains that made wrong probability assessments  citation   therefore  there must be some logical explanation for those biases
OWNX	it was also suggested that  since our ancestors had to deal with observed frequencies instead of probability values  the observed biases might disappear if people were presented with data in the form of observed frequencies in a typical bayes theorem problem
MISC	gigerenzer and hoffrage  citation  conducted an experiment confirming this idea
MISC	however  other studies checking those claims  citation  have shown that frequency formats seem to improve the reasoning only under some circumstances
MISC	if those circumstances are not met  frequency formats have either no effect or might even cause worse probability evaluations by the tested subjects
MISC	and  as a matter of fact  they have shown that  for decision problems  there are simple heuristics that do a surprisingly good job  citation
OWNX	but  since many of the calculations involved in the laboratory experiments are not too difficult to perform  the question of the reasons behind our probabilistic reasoning mistakes still needed answering
MISC	if we are using a reasonable heuristics to perform probabilistic calculations  understanding when this is a good heuristic and why it fails in the tests is an important question
MISC	of course  the na   number  ve idea that people should simply use observed frequencies  instead of probability values  can certainly be improved from a bayesian point of view
MISC	the argument that our ancestors should be well adapted to deal with uncertainty from their own observations is quite compelling  but  to make it complete  we can ask what would happen if our ancestors minds and therefore  our own were actually more sophisticated than a simple frequentistic mind
MISC	if they had a brain that  although possibly using rules of thumb  behaved in a way that mimicked a bayesian inference instead of a frequentistic evaluation  they would be better equipped to make sound decisions and  therefore  that would have been a good adaptation
MISC	and that would eventually lead those cousins to extinction
OWNX	but  even if this is the dynamics behind our heuristics  good learning should lead us closer to a bayesian answer than afrequentistic one
OWNX	evidence supporting the idea that our reasoning resembles bayesian reasoning already exists
MISC	tenenbaum et al in press have shown that observed inductive reasoning can be modeled by theory-based bayesian models and that those models can provide approximately optimal inference
MISC	in a recent work  citation   i have proposed the adaptive probability theory apt
MISC	if one supposes that people treat all probability values as if they were uncertain even when they are not and make some assumptions about the sample size where those probabilities would have been observed as frequencies  it follows that the observed shape of the weighting functions is obtained
OWNX	here  i will review those results and also show that we can extend the ideas that were introduced to explain weighting functions to explain other observed biases
MISC	i will show that some of those biases can be partially explained as a result of a mind adapted to make inferences in an environment where probabilities have uncertainties associated to them
MISC	and i will propose that bayesian methods should be used as part of the explanation behind a number of other biases  citation
MISC	usually  science involves working on theories that should describe a set of data  making predictions from those theories and testing them in experiments
MISC	decision theory  however  requires a broader definition of proper scientific work
MISC	it does not necessarily describe real behavior  since it is based on assumptions about what the best choice is  not about how real people behave
MISC	its testing is against other decision strategies and  as long as it provides optimal decisions  the normative theory is correct  even if it does not predict behavior for any kind of agents
MISC	that means that certain actions can be labeled as wrong  in the sense that they are far from optimal decisions  even though they correspond to real actions of real people
MISC	this peculiarity of decision theory means that not every model needs to actually predict behavior
MISC	given non-optimal observed behavior  understanding what makes the deciders to behave that way is also a valid line of inquiry
MISC	that is where apt stands
MISC	its main purpose is to show that apparently irrational behavior can be based on an analysis of the decision problem that follows from normative theory
MISC	the assumptions behind such analysis might be wrong and  therefore  the observed behavior would not be optimal
OWNX	that means that our common sense is not perfect
MISC	however  if it works well for most real life problems  it is either a good adaptation or well learned
MISC	apt intends to make a bridge between normative and descriptive theories
OWNX	this means that it is an exploratory work  in the sense of trying to understand the problems that led our minds to reason the way they do
MISC	while based on normative theory  it was designed to agree with the observed biases
MISC	this means that apt does not claim to be the best actual description of real behavior although it might be
MISC	the recognition heuristic  citation  makes the counter-intuitive prediction that a decision maker utilizing less information may do as well as  or outperform  an idealized decision maker utilizing more information
OWNX	we lay a theoretical foundation for the use of single-variable heuristics such as the recognition heuristic as an optimal decision strategy within a linear modeling framework
OWNX	we also show that  under related conditions  weighting only one variable and ignoring all others produces the same risk as ignoring the single variable and weighting all others
MISC	this approach has the advantage of generalizing beyond the original environment of the recognition heuristic to situations with more than two choice options  binary or continuous representations of recognition  and to other single variable heuristics
OWNX	we analyze the structure of data used in some prior recognition tasks and find that it matches the sufficient conditions for optimality in our results
MISC	rather than being a poor or adequate substitute for a compensatory model  the recognition heuristic closely approximates an optimal strategy when a decision maker has finite data about the world
MISC	common sense would suggest that it is always better to have more  rather than less  relevant information when making a decision
MISC	most normative and prescriptive theories of multi-attribute decision making are compensatory models that incorporate all relevant variables
MISC	this perspective was challenged by gigerenzer and goldstein  citation  and gigerenzer  todd  and the abc group  citation   who proposed a theoretical framework of simple decision rules  often referred to as  fast and frugal  heuristics  suggesting that in some cases a decision maker dm utilizing less relevant information may actually outperform an idealized dm utilizing all relevant information
MISC	key among these single-variable decision rules is the recognition heuristic rh  citation
MISC	a rapidly growing empirical literature suggests that single-variable decision rules are descriptive for at least a subset of dms with regard to both take the best  citation  and the rh  citation
MISC	questions remain  however  as to exactly when and why a single-variable rule will perform well
MISC	hogarth and karelaia  citation  examined the relative performance of single-variable rules within a binary choice framework where both predictor independent and criterion dependent variable were assumed to be continuous
MISC	using a combination of analytic tools and simulations  they found that single-variable rules have strong predictive accuracy when   number  all predictors are highly and positively inter-correlated   number  the single predictor used is highly and  typically  positively correlated with the criterion
MISC	hogarth and karelaia  citation  conducted a related analysis using binary rather than continuous cues predictors
MISC	fasolo  mcclelland  and todd  citation  identified similar favorable conditions for single-variable rules using a series of simulations
MISC	shanteau and thomas  citation  labeled environments with highly positively correlated predictors   friendly  environments  and demonstrated in a simulation that single-variable rules tended to underperform when the predictors in the model were negatively correlated  a finding that was later replicated by fasolo et al citation   citation
MISC	in a similar vein  baucells  carrasco  and hogarth  citation  presented a framework to analyze simple decision rules within the context of cumulative dominance  citation
AIMX	in this paper  we present results regarding the effectiveness of single variable rules that diverge from previous studies in two major ways
MISC	this result is a major departure from previous studies  citation  that identify favorable conditions for single-variable rules as  single-factor  models where all variables are highly positively correlated
MISC	the only thing that matters is the sign on the correlation of the single cue
MISC	some lexicographic single-variable rules depend upon either the knowledge or estimation of all cue validities
MISC	for example  the take the best rule  citation  depends on the identification of the single best cue
OWNX	the divergence in our results stems from our somewhat different approach to answering the question  when does less information lead to better performance
OWNX	  first  we characterize the rh within the framework of the linear model - i e   within the standard regression framework - as an  estimator  that relies on a single predictor
MISC	we then consider the weights that would be placed on the cues by various decision heuristics such as equal weighting as if they were estimates of  beta
OWNX	within this framework  we can prove results with respect to a measure of statistical inaccuracy called  risk  defined formally in section  number   which measures how close these heuristic weights are expected to be to the best weights   beta
MISC	this measure of inaccuracy is particularly useful because it goes beyond optimizing within a single sample  the closer a set of weights is to the best weights  the more robustly it cross-validate in new samples
MISC	an advantage to casting the problem within the framework of the linear model is that the results can be generalized to accommodate a broad range of situations  including choosing between more than two options  binary or continuous representations of recognition  and to evaluate the success of any single variable rule  not just rh
OWNX	as the number of cues becomes large  this mini-max strategy converges to a rule that puts a large weight on a single cue and minimally weights all others
OWNX	further  we show that weighting the single cue and ignoring all others produces the same risk as ignoring the single cue and weighting all others  regardless of the number of cues
MISC	previous research has shown that decision heuristics applied in this manner outperform standard regression models until samples become very large  citation
OWNX	thus we expect that  under the right conditions  a single variable to be just as accurate a predictor as the full set of predictors
MISC	the rh theory is a natural application of these results as this theory also does not presuppose a cue selection process  i e   if one alternative is recognized and the other is not then recognition is automatically the predictor cue of interest
MISC	why is recognition rational
OWNX	our results demonstrate that when a single cue recognition is positively correlated with all other cues knowledge  then it is a mini-max strategy to over-weight the recognition cue
MISC	interestingly  these results do not depend upon the validities of either the recognition or the knowledge cues
MISC	thus  while goldstein and gigerenzer  citation  see the rh approach as a contrast to heuristics being used as  imperfect versions of optimal statistical procedures   it appears that the  laplacean demon   citation  - with unlimited computational power - would use a rule much like the rh
OWNX	we then describe the sufficient conditions for the single-variable  over-weighting  phenomenon  first considering the case of a single variable correlated with an array of weakly positively inter-correlated predictors followed by the more extreme case of a set of mutually uncorrelated predictors within this array
OWNX	we then present an application of this theory to the rh and prove that under these conditions a dm utilizing only recognition will perform at least as well as a dm utilizing only knowledge
MISC	schelling  citation  observed that macro-level patterns do not necessarily reflect micro-level intentions  desires or goals
MISC	most extensions of schelling's model have replicated this result
MISC	there is an important mismatch  however  between theory and observation  which has received relatively little attention
MISC	as in the classic schelling model  agents in a simulated world want to stay or move to a new location depending on the proportion of neighbors they judge to be acceptable
MISC	in contrast to the classic model  agents' classifications of their neighbors as acceptable or not depend lexicographically on recognition first and group type e g   ethnic stereotyping second
MISC	the face-recognition model nests classic schelling  when agents have no recognition memory  judgments about the acceptability of a prospective neighbor rely solely on his or her group type as in the schelling model
MISC	based on his counterintuitive observation concerning neighborhood segregation  nobel laureate thomas schelling  citation  established what would become a large and influential literature connecting various subfields of the social sciences
OWNX	when one observes the sharp ethnic segregation that exists in a regrettably large number of us cities  schelling argued we ought not conclude that this is necessarily the result of anti-ethnic sentiment among either majority or minority group members
MISC	schelling's classic segregation model shows  for example  that when people are happy with any location at which up to half their neighbors belong to a different ethnic group  one should nevertheless predict dramatic segregation into nearly homogeneous ethnic blocs that no individual explicitly sought or wished for
MISC	the incongruity of macro consequences that do not reflect individual objectives is the overarching theme referred to in the title of schelling's  citation  micromotives and macrobehavior
MISC	one might dismiss the relevance of schelling's very simple model to the complexity of real-world neighborhoods and other social communities  such as academic departments  where methodological splits into subgroups sometimes lead to conflict and segregation e g   empirical versus theoretical divides which are common in economics departments  or social psychologists interacting quite separately from other sub-disciplines within psychology departments
MISC	yet schelling's model is widely used to inform analyses of policies at virtually all levels of local  state and federal government  as well as among private firms and non-profits such as universities dealing with segregation of many kinds
CONT	although schelling's neighborhood segregation model gave rise to a substantial new literature that remains active to this day  there is an important mismatch between theory and empirical observation that has received relatively little attention
OWNX	schelling's model predicts high levels of segregation starting from virtually anywhere within a very large set of initial conditions and parameter values
MISC	yet empirical studies documenting various forms of segregation e g   ethnic types among cities  gender types among work places  or methodological types among academic institutions reveal considerable variation in the extent to which social groups are observed to engage in inter-group mixing
MISC	whereas the world presents observers with a rich variety of heterogeneous segregation outcomes  schelling's theory does not easily account for this variation as a systematic function of variables or parameters within the model  which raises interesting questions
MISC	can the schelling model be squared with real world data
MISC	are there extensions of the schelling model that come closer to reality by predicting heterogeneous segregation levels that vary systematically with observable factors in the environment
MISC	this capacity enables simulated agents to apply the face-recognition heuristic
MISC	at the same time  the acronym face for fast acceptance by common experience refers to the insight that shared local experience can facilitate rapid formation of relationships and  thus  transform assessments of others' underlying quality in a process by which a recognized face  and the quality of its associated memory i e   positive or negative  absolutely over-rules the inference that would have been made by stereotyping based on group identity
MISC	according to this definition  fast acceptance by common experience refers to rapidly formed recognition-based classifications of others' quality e g   an  acceptable  versus  unacceptable  neighbor without regard to group identity  when classifying those with whom face-to-face experience has taken place in the past
MISC	when an unrecognized other person is to be classified  the face-recognition heuristic reduces to stereotyping based solely on group identity  exactly the same as in the classic schelling model
MISC	however  when there is even a small amount of shared experience  the quality of that shared experience from the past determines how other people are classified
MISC	classifications based on recognition memory lexicographically over-rule group identity  which is the basis for classification of unrecognized agents in both face and classic schelling models
MISC	the model shows that when agents possess face-recognition that lasts as short as a single period encoding a maximum of only  number  individual faces out of a substantially larger population  this alone is enough to produce significantly higher levels of integration
AIMX	the key comparison investigated in this paper concerns this variable degree of recognition memory e g   no recognition memory as in the classic schelling model versus any positive number of periods for which the faces of those one encounters remains coded in memory
MISC	by introducing variable recognition memory as a representation of heterogeneity in real-world environments which sometimes have few  sometimes many  opportunities for random face-to-face encounters with other-type agents  the model investigates a novel source of systematic variation into the otherwise classic model of segregation
MISC	the motivation for studying the effect of recognition classification on segregation is to better understand why some real-world environments succeed at achieving sustained levels of cross-group interaction i e   high levels of integration while others seem to be locked into a stubbornly unchanging pattern of segregation
OWNX	the model is intended to contribute substantively and constructively to policy analysis with a simple message  namely  that we can  relatively cheaply  design institutions that produce modest opportunities for face-to-face encounters with members of other groups
MISC	then  to the extent that people use an acceptance rule based partially on recognition  random face-to-face inter-group mixing could potentially generate large and stable levels of integration that are too pessimistically ruled out by the vast majority of studies based on schelling's model
OWNX	we then introduce the face-recognition heuristic and specify the recognition-augmented schelling model  an encompassing model that nests the classic schelling model as a special case
MISC	the recognition heuristic exploits the basic psychological capacity for recognition in order to make inferences about unknown quantities in the world
OWNX	in this article  we review and clarify issues that emerged from our initial work  citation   including the distinction between a recognition and an evaluation process
MISC	little is known about these individual differences  or how to precisely model the alternative strategies
MISC	although some researchers have attributed judgments inconsistent with the use of the recognition heuristic to compensatory processing  little research on such compensatory models has been reported
OWNX	we discuss extensions of the recognition model  open questions  unanticipated results  and the surprising predictive power of recognition in forecasting
MISC	in accordance with simon's emphasis on computational models  the recognition principle as it was first called was formulated as a building block of take-the-best and other heuristics  in order to model inferences from memory  citation
MISC	subsequently  it was realized that this initial building block could function as a stand-alone model for the same type of inferences  and it was named the recognition heuristic  citation
MISC	in reality  the recognition heuristic was not derived in such a logical manner
MISC	serendipity  the luck of finding something one was not looking for  assisted its birth
MISC	in his dissertation  ulrich hoffrage  citation  set out to test this prediction  for which he needed two sets of questions  one hard  one easy
MISC	hoffrage chose questions concerning the populations of american cities and german cities  which are respectively hard and easy for german students-or so everyone thought
MISC	how could people score more correct answers in a domain in which they knew less
OWNX	for days  our research group failed to think of a cognitive process that makes more out of less
MISC	if a person has heard of one city but not the other  this lack of recognition can be informative  indicating that the recognized city probably has the larger population
MISC	for the german cities  the participants could not rely on the recognition heuristic-they knew too much
OWNX	we return to this condition later
OWNX	one possible reason why it took us so long to find the answer was our training in classical statistical models
MISC	in a weighted linear model  adding a cue or predictor can never decrease its fit  such as unadjusted r  and the same is true for bayes' rule  citation
MISC	a good cognitive heuristic  however  should excel in foresight as well as in hindsight
MISC	the possibility that people could sometimes do better with less knowledge has generated much interest and controversy in the social sciences and in the media
MISC	in may  number   the bbc  intrigued by the idea of less being more  decided to test the effect on their radio  number   more or less  program
MISC	listeners in new york and london were asked whether detroit or milwaukee has the larger population
OWNX	in exploratory studies for his dissertation  one of us  citation  had found that about  number  percent  of american students answered correctly  detroit   compared to  number  percent  of a corresponding group of german participants
MISC	but they did
MISC	the recognition heuristic assumes that people make inferences based on the output of recognition memory
MISC	while much work has been devoted to establishing the recognition heuristic as a viable description of how people make inferences  more work is needed to fully integrate research on the recognition heuristic with research from the broader cognitive psychology literature
MISC	goldstein and gigerenzer  citation  proposed the recognition heuristic as a mechanism to describe inferential judgments
MISC	briefly  this heuristic asserts that an inference can be made merely on the basis of the presence or absence of information in memory   if one of two objects is recognized and the other is not  then infer that the recognized object has the higher value   citation
MISC	the elegance of the recognition heuristic as a decision rule lies in its simplicity - not only does it purport that inferences can be achieved through a simple rule  but it is also appears to be an intuitive process model
MISC	the development of the recognition heuristic by goldstein and gigerenzer  citation  has fueled over a decade of research within behavioral decision-making
MISC	while the recognition heuristic has been well received by many researchers  citation   others have been rather critical of its accuracy in describing the underlying psychological processes  citation
MISC	these criticisms notwithstanding  the recognition heuristic has led to a focus on recognition-based inference and  much like other heuristics  such as representativeness  has managed a permanent place within the judgment and decision making vernacular  citation
MISC	while the construct of representativeness proved transformational to judgment and decision making research  it has arguably run its course as a useful theoretical construct  citation
MISC	the question  however  is whether the recognition heuristic will follow a similar path
OWNX	in this article  we present four closely related challenges for researchers investigating the recognition heuristic  as well as a call for a fundamental shift in research strategy
OWNX	before going into detail  a few comments are warranted
OWNX	first  our four challenges and our call for a research strategy shift are not intended as criticisms  but rather as proposals for future research directions
OWNX	finally  some of our challenges are intended to consider the full import of memory processes for judgment and decision making
MISC	the literature on memory theory provides fertile ground for enriching and extending theories of judgment and decision making
MISC	while recent work in decision theory has emphasized the adaptive role that recognition may play in facilitating accurate judgment  errors and biases are commonplace amongst memory phenomena  including such effects as false-memories  citation   misinformation  citation   imagination inflation  citation   and reality and source monitoring errors  citation   amongst many others  citation
MISC	in a similar vein  inasmuch as there are multiple strategies that may be deployed for guiding judgment and decision making-as is assumed by the framework in which the recognition heuristic has been developed-there is a need for developing cognitive architectures that both accommodate multiple strategies and model how people select amongst them
MISC	for example  it is not sufficient to postulate that some choices are made by relying on recognition memory  one must model as precisely as possible how the decision maker has come to utilize recognition  as opposed to some other process
MISC	the collective recognition heuristic is a simple forecasting heuristic that bets on the fact that people's recognition knowledge of names is a proxy for their competitiveness  in sports  it predicts that the better-known team or player wins a game
MISC	the performance of the collective recognition heuristic is compared to two benchmarks  predictions based on official rankings and aggregated betting odds
MISC	across three soccer and two tennis tournaments  the predictions based on recognition performed similar to those based on rankings  when compared with betting odds  the heuristic fared reasonably well
MISC	forecasts based on rankings-but not on betting odds-were improved by incorporating collective recognition information
OWNX	we discuss the use of recognition for forecasting in sports and conclude that aggregating across individual ignorance spawns collective wisdom
MISC	with thousands of bookmakers accepting wagers on sporting events around the world  today  betting on sports is more popular than ever before
MISC	for example  in  number  bettors in the uk alone wagered  number  million british pounds on soccer games-placing over  number  million bets in total  citation
MISC	many different approaches have been proposed  citation
MISC	one common denominator is to muster plenty of knowledge-ranging from various indicators of the strength of individual players and teams to information about past outcomes  such as wins  losses-and then predict game scores e g    number   number  or game outcomes  citation  based on that knowledge
MISC	knowledge about teams or players seems indispensable for rendering accurate forecasts-statistically or informally
MISC	indeed  it seems absurd to assume that one can successfully predict which tennis player will win a match if one does not even know most of the names of his or her competitors in the tournament
MISC	or can one
MISC	for instance  in a recent study  the ranks of tennis players performing in the wimbledon  number  tournament-based on how often they were recognized by  number  amateur tennis players-predicted the match winners better than the atp entry ranking  citation
MISC	this  wisdom of ignorant crowds  is one among several examples in sports of the surprising predictive power of simple heuristics that forgo the exploitation of ample amounts of knowledge  citation
MISC	the fact that simple forecasting mechanisms can compete with or even outperform more sophisticated ones is by no means a new insight  citation
MISC	this finding  however  has been repeatedly met with resistance  is not widely put to use  citation   and has not yet made it into popular textbooks of  for example  econometrics see hogarth  in press
MISC	one reason may be the intuitive appeal of the accuracy-effort trade-off  the less information  computation  or time that one uses  the less accurate one's judgments will be
MISC	this trade-off is believed to be one of the few general laws of the human mind  citation   and violations of this law are seen as odd exceptions
MISC	in the domain of forecasting sports events it is indeed difficult to judge to  what simple forecasting strategies can outperform more complex ones  simply because of the dearth of data
MISC	in a recent review  goldstein and  gigerenzer  citation  noted that   there is a need to test the relative performance of heuristics  experts  and complex forecasting methods more systematically over the years rather than in a few arbitrary championships  p  number 
MISC	first  it presents two new studies on the predictive power of recognition in forecasting soccer games  citation
MISC	these two studies will show to what extent the previous results can be replicated  citation
MISC	second  it compares the predictive power of recognition in these two studies and in previously published research  citation  against two benchmarks in all tournaments  predictions based on official rankings e g   fifa for soccer and aggregated betting odds
MISC	i describe and discuss the sometimes heated controversy surrounding the recognition heuristic rh as a model of inferential decision making
MISC	after briefly recapitulating the history of the rh up to its current version  i critically evaluate several specific assumptions and predictions of the rh and its surrounding framework  recognition as a memory-based process  the rh as a cognitive process model  proper conditions of testing the rh  measures of using the rh  reasons for not using the rh  the rh as a non-compensatory strategy  evidence for a less-is-more effect lime  and the rh as part of the toolbox
MISC	the collection of these controversial issues may help to better understand the debate  to further sharpen the rh theory  and to develop ideas for future research
MISC	as one of the simplest heuristics in the  adaptive toolbox   citation   the recognition heuristic rh exploits recognition and may reach a high level of accuracy in inferential decisions
MISC	for example  if asked which of two cities is larger  a or b  and given one recognizes a  but not b  one may simply follow the recognition cue and infer that a is the larger city
MISC	goldstein and gigerenzer  citation  formulated this strategy as the recognition heuristic and defined it as using only one piece of evidence  namely recognition of the two objects yes no
MISC	no other knowledge about the objects enters the inference process and could possibly overturn the decision based on recognition
MISC	the rh thus represents a case of a non-compensatory  one-reason decision-making strategy
MISC	especially this claim has raised some controversy in the past decade and has led to a multitude of new empirical findings
OWNX	in the following section section  number   i recapitulate the basic features of the rh and its underlying assumptions  looking at its precursors and its fully laid-out version
MISC	the recognition heuristic models the adaptive use and dominant role of recognition knowledge in judgment under uncertainty
MISC	of the several predictions that the heuristic makes  empirical tests have predominantly focused on the proposed noncompensatory processing of recognition
MISC	some authors have emphasized that the heuristic needs to be scrutinized based on precise tests of the exclusive use of recognition
MISC	first  i argue that using precise measures of the exclusive use of recognition has to go beyond showing that the recognition heuristic-like every model-cannot capture reality completely
MISC	second  i illustrate how precise tests based on response times can lead to unsubstantiated conclusions if the fact that the recognition heuristic does not model the recognition judgment itself is ignored
MISC	finally  i highlight two key but so far neglected aspects of the recognition heuristic  a the connection between recognition memory and the recognition heuristic  and b the mechanisms underlying the adaptive use of recognition
MISC	in his essays  the french philosopher michel de montaigne suggested that a good memory is not necessarily coupled with good decision making
MISC	in fact  he seems to imply that decisions can sometimes even benefit from deficits in memory
MISC	how could this be possible
MISC	one answer is that because structures in the mind often reflect meaningful regularities in the world  citation   blanks in memory can be exploited for making inferences about the world
MISC	the notion that judgments feed on dynamics in memory has been taken up in several models of decision making
MISC	for instance  tversky and kahneman  citation  proposed that the ease with which instances or occurrences can be brought to mind  is an ecologically valid clue  p  number  about the world and that an availability heuristic based on this ease might operate when people judge probability or frequency
MISC	in contrast to the availability heuristic  the recognition heuristic is a clearly specified computational model with precise search  stopping  and decision rules
MISC	moreover  the recognition heuristic was proposed as an adaptive mental tool with specific boundary conditions  citation
MISC	the recognition heuristic makes several testable predictions about recognition and its use in decision making
MISC	first  as the recognition heuristic is assumed to be ecologically rational i e   exploiting a regularity in the environment  recognition should be frequently correlated with quantities in the world
MISC	second  people's use of the recognition heuristic should be sensitive to the structure of the environment
MISC	third  the recognition heuristic predicts that recognition is processed in a noncompensatory fashion-that is  recognition should supersede further cue knowledge
MISC	maybe not surprisingly  not all empirical investigations have found evidence supporting the heuristic
MISC	of the several predictions that the heuristic makes  it seems fair to say that the assumed noncompensatory processing of recognition has received the greatest attention so far-and has generated the strongest objection  citation
MISC	some authors have emphasized the need for precise tests of the recognition heuristic  and a developed precise measures of the exclusive use of recognition  arguing that  precise models deserve precise measures  and b conducted precise tests of the information processing in recognition-based inference based on response times  citation
MISC	in addition  i highlight two key issues underlying the use of recognition in decision making that seem to have been neglected as a result of the strong focus on testing the noncompensatory processing of recognition
MISC	second  i summarize proposals of how people might adaptively adjust their reliance on recognition across different situations
MISC	importantly  i do not argue that the developments of precise measures or demonstrations of the recognition heuristic's failure to predict data should be ignored
MISC	rather  i call for a more constructive way to use these findings for refining models of memory-based decision making
MISC	the advantage of models that do not use flexible parameters is that one can precisely show to what degree they predict behavior  and in what situations
MISC	in three issues of this journal  the recognition heuristic has been examined carefully from many points of view
OWNX	we comment here on four themes  the use of optimization models to understand the rationality of heuristics  the generalization of the recognition input beyond a binary judgment  new conditions for less-is-more effects  and the importance of specifying boundary conditions for cognitive heuristics
MISC	simple models  from physics to psychology  have driven much of progress in science
MISC	the beauty of simple models is that one can easily discover their limits  that is  their boundary conditions  which in turn fosters clarity and progress
MISC	similarly  the laws of learning do not hold in every situation  as illustrated by the concept of  biological preparedness   the fact that certain cs-ucs conditional stimulus - unconditional stimulus associations are learned rapidly but not others  citation
MISC	evolved organisms work with multiple tools  not one general principle
MISC	the concept of an adaptive toolbox assumes that an individual  culture  or species can be characterized by a set of heuristics for surviving in an uncertain world
MISC	these heuristics exploit evolved and learned core capacities  and are simple in order to be robust  fast  and efficient
MISC	the recognition heuristic is one of these tools in the adaptive toolbox of humans and other animal species and exploits recognition memory
OWNX	this journal has devoted three special issues to elaborating  generalizing  and testing the model we proposed a decade ago  citation
MISC	the  less is more effect  lime occurs when a recognition-dependent agent has a greater probability of choosing the better item than a more knowledgeable agent who recognizes more items
MISC	goldstein and gigerenzer  citation  define  alpha  as the probability that a correct choice is made on the basis of recognition alone and  beta  the probability that a correct choice is made when both items are recognized via additional cues
MISC	they claim that a lime occurs if  alpha   greater than   beta   alpha   greater than   number   number  and  alpha  and  beta  remain constant as the number of recognized items  n  varies
MISC	the major findings presented here are as follows   	demonstrations that the lime can occur when  alpha   less than or equal to   beta  and fail to occur when  alpha   greater than   beta   and derivation of the conditions for these co-occurrences  	a new characterization of the conditions under which the lime occurs  	generalizations of this characterization to handle imperfect recognition  and  	characterization of when the lime occurs as more items become recognized
MISC	the primary implication of these results is that the advantage of the recognition cue depends not only on cue validities  but also on the order in which items are learned
MISC	this realization  in turn  suggests that research in this area should incorporate a more dynamic focus on learning and memory processes  and the effects of reputational information
MISC	the  less is more effect  lime occurs when a recognition-dependent agent has a greater probability of choosing the better item than a more knowledgeable agent who recognizes more items
OWNX	goldstein and gigerenzer  citation  reported a  number  percent  usage rate
MISC	serwe and frings  citation  found that  number  percent  of their lay and  number  percent  of their amateur samples used the recognition heuristic in choosing tennis match winners
OWNX	newell and shanks  citation  reported  number  percent  usage in a stock-market setting
MISC	pachur and biele  citation  found that the recognition heuristic accounted for  number  percent  of the forecasts in their study  more than four other candidate mechanisms
MISC	however  empirical evidence for the lime is equivocal  at least on face value
MISC	goldstein and gigerenzer  citation   serwe and frings  citation   and scheibehenne and broder  citation  are definitely in the  yes  camp  pohl  citation  finds that the lime is possible but claims only small effect-sizes  andersson  edman and ekman  citation  and ayton and onkal  citation  present  less is as good as more  evidence  and pachur and biele  citation  are decidedly in the  no  camp
MISC	simulation studies based on real ecologies lend some support to the prospect of limes  citation
MISC	moreover  schooler and hertwig  citation  and pleskac  citation  present simulation results suggesting that imperfect recognition may actually increase the likelihood of a lime
MISC	matters are further complicated by shortcomings in some of the studies and an apparent lack of consensus on the requirements for a test of the lime
MISC	goldstein and gigerenzer  citation  define  alpha  as the probability that a correct choice is made on the basis of recognition alone and  beta  the probability that a correct choice is made when both items are recognized via additional cues
MISC	they claim that a lime occurs if  alpha   greater than   beta   alpha   greater than   number   number  and  alpha  and  beta  remain constant as the number of recognized items  n  varies
MISC	this view has been widely accepted and used as a guide for when to expect the lime  citation
MISC	pleskac  citation  concurs with goldstein and gigerenzer and makes an analogous claim under conditions of imperfect recognition
MISC	however  goldstein and gigerenzer assume that  alpha  and  beta  remain constant as the number of recognized items  n  varies
MISC	a sufficiently rigorous approach to this problem begins by distinguishing between the probability   beta   of correctly choosing between pairs of recognized items using the knowledge cue  and the probability  v  of correctly choosing between any pair of items using the knowledge cue i e   v is the knowledge cue validity
OWNX	to begin  i will demonstrate that the lime can occur when  alpha   less than   beta
OWNX	in table  number  we have  number  items of which  number  are recognized
MISC	from table  number   the number of correct choices is the sum of the  number -entries in the  recog
MISC	the number of incorrect choices is the sum of the  number -entries whose rank is greater than each of the  number  entries  d    number     number     number     number 
MISC	for example  the first item has cue-rank  number  so by using the cue to compare it with the other  number  items we would correctly choose the first item as the better-ranked
OWNX	in contrast  the third item has cue-rank  number   so we would make only  number  correct choice in comparing its cue-rank with those of the items that actually are ranked worse
MISC	the d column shows the corresponding number of incorrect choices
MISC	there are c    number  correct and d    number  incorrect choices  resulting in a cue validity v    number   number   number      number 
MISC	likewise  from the last two columns in table  number   the probability of choosing correctly between pairs of recognized items by using the knowledge cue is  beta    c c   d    number   number   number      number 
MISC	note that v  not equal to   beta
MISC	that is  we have an example of the fact that the probability of making a correct choice between pairs from the  number  recognized items is not the same as the probability of making a correct choice when all  number  items are recognized
MISC	moreover  both  alpha  and  beta  can vary depending on the order in which the remaining items are learned i e   become recognizable
MISC	for example  if the next item learned is item  number  or  number  then the result will be  beta      number   whereas if the next is item  number  or  number  then the result will be  beta     number 
MISC	likewise  if item  number  is learned next  alpha      number  whereas if item  number  is learned next  alpha     number 
OWNX	these examples show variation in  alpha  and  beta  as n varies  and they demonstrate that both parameters can take different values for alternative collections of recognized items having the same n
MISC	moreover  there is no generalized relation between the range of possible values of  beta  and v
MISC	assuming v  greater than or equal to   number   number  i e   use any negative cue in reverse  there is always at least one pair of items whose rank-order matches the order of the cue  so that if only those two items have been learned then  beta     number 
MISC	conversely  if v  less than   number  then there is always at least one pair whose rank-order and cue-order are reversed so that if only those two items have been learned then  beta     number 
MISC	by the same argument   alpha  can range from  number  to  number  depending on the order in which items are learned
OWNX	now  we shall build up the probability of making a correct choice between pairs of items in table  number   initially following goldstein and gigerenzer
MISC	the probability of a correct choice when both items are unrecognized i e   where a guess must be made is
MISC	summing these terms gives goldstein and gigerenzer's  citation  formula
MISC	thus  we have the lime because v     number   less than  fn    number   but we also have  alpha     number   less than   beta     number   so we observe that if  beta  is allowed to vary and thus differ from v a lime can occur when  alpha   less than   beta
MISC	when  alpha  and  beta  are not constant  not only can the lime occur when  alpha   less than   beta   but the condition  alpha   greater than   beta  does not guarantee a lime
MISC	a counter-example can be constructed by modifying the one in table  number 
MISC	then the knowledge cue validity is v    number   number     number      number 
MISC	then  alpha     number   number     number      number  and  beta     number   number     number     number   and  alpha   greater than   beta  is satisfied
MISC	however  both  alpha  and  beta  are less than v so no weighted sum of them and  number   number  is going to exceed v
MISC	indeed  fn     number   so the lime does not occur
MISC	i shall address the issue of how common are occurrences of the lime when  alpha   less than   beta  and no lime when  alpha   greater than   beta  in sections to follow
OWNX	finally  we need to distinguish among various definitions of the lime
MISC	goldstein and gigerenzer point out that there are at least three versions  one comparing more and less knowledgeable agents  another comparing performance in different domains  and a third comparing performance as an agent learns new items
MISC	but another is fn  greater than  fn  number   which can occur regardless of whether v  less than  fn
MISC	the third lays out the conditions under which the lime can occur under conditions of perfect and imperfect recognition
OWNX	the fourth deals with the effect of learning items  and there is a brief concluding section
MISC	research on the processing of recognition information has focused on testing the recognition heuristic rh
MISC	on the aggregate  the noncompensatory use of recognition information postulated by the rh was rejected in several studies  while rh could still account for a considerable proportion of choices
MISC	these results can be explained if either a a part of the subjects used rh or b nobody used it but its choice predictions were accidentally in line with predictions of the strategy used
MISC	for  number   number  percent  of the subjects  overall behavior was best explained by a compensatory parallel constraint satisfaction pcs strategy
MISC	the proportion of subjects using an enhanced rh heuristic rhe was negligible up to  number   number  percent    number  percent  of the subjects seemed to use a take the best strategy ttb
OWNX	our results are consistent with previous literature highlighting the importance of individual strategy classification as compared to aggregated analyses
MISC	imagine you visit a nice conference in southern france
MISC	your presentation was successful and you want to reward yourself with a good wine
MISC	you are offered a chateau teyssier and a chateau margaux
MISC	you have not tried the wines before but you remember having heard of chateau margaux
OWNX	the offered  number  chateau teyssier is from st
MISC	emilion  and has a grand cru classification
MISC	the chateau margaux is from the medoc  has a premier cru classification and is from  number 
OWNX	alternatively you might compare the bottles on the available cues in a stepwise manner  starting  for instance  with the region and instantly choose the chateau teyssier because you know that wine from the st
MISC	emilion region usually meets your preferences
MISC	you might quickly come up with a consistent interpretation for all pieces of information  although chateau margaux has an outstanding classification and is well known  it would be suboptimal to drink such a wine so early
MISC	the chateau teyssier is clearly preferable because it comes from an excellent region  has a good classification and has been sufficiently matured
MISC	most previous research on processing recognition information has focused on testing for or against the rh
MISC	the recognition heuristic rh - which predicts non-compensatory reliance on recognition in comparative judgments - has attracted much research and some disagreement  at times
MISC	most studies have dealt with whether or under which conditions the rh is truly used in paired-comparisons
MISC	however  even though the rh is a precise descriptive model  there has been less attention concerning the precision of the methods applied to measure rh-use
MISC	in the current work  i provide an overview of different measures of rh-use tailored to the paradigm of natural recognition which has emerged as a preferred way of studying the rh
MISC	the measures are compared with respect to different criteria - with particular emphasis on how well they uncover true use of the rh
MISC	the results indicate that the adherence rate - which has been pervasively applied to measure rh-use - is a severely biased measure
MISC	as an alternative  a recently developed formal measurement model emerges as the recommended candidate for assessment of rh-use
MISC	in the past decade since it was baptized  the recognition heuristic  citation  has inspired much innovative research
MISC	it has been studied extensively from a normative and descriptive point of view and provoked some controversial debate at times
MISC	many other interesting investigations notwithstanding  the majority of empirical studies has dealt with the descriptive question of whether and to what extent the recognition cue is considered in isolation - that is  how often the rh is actually used
MISC	clearly  the rh is a precise model which makes exact predictions about choices and underlying processes
MISC	although many agree that it is a promising and fruitful research strategy to uncover the situational and individual determinants of fast-and-frugal heuristics broder  in press  it is  as yet  much less clear how to study and measure rh-use
MISC	so far  emphasis has been put on which paradigms and materials are appropriate for studying the rh
MISC	indeed  pachur et al citation  provided an extensive discussion of such questions
MISC	they suggested no less than eight critical methodological necessities which an adequate investigation or test of the rh should  in their view  comprise
MISC	also  they reviewed the extant literature and argued that many previously published studies yield drawbacks with respect to these eight points  citation
MISC	as a central point  pachur et al citation  argue that the rh is more likely to be used when objects are naturally recognized and cues must be retrieved from memory
MISC	this is in line with the assumption that inferences from memory are more often based on simple heuristics  an assumption that has received support in the past  citation
MISC	the central argument favoring naturally recognized objects is that the rh hinges on decision makers acquiring the recognition-criterion-relation through experience and thus learning to trust on recognition when appropriate
MISC	assume a participant is faced with the judgment which of two cities is larger and recognizes one but not the other
MISC	if she provides the judgment that the recognized object has the higher criterion value  a choice in line with the rh is produced
MISC	however  such cases of adherence cannot imply that recognition was considered in isolation and thus do not provide information about use of the rh
MISC	in the case of comparing a recognized with an unrecognized city  for example  a decision maker may have chosen the recognized city based on the knowledge that this city has an international airport  a large university  or the like
MISC	thus  so long as there is no control over participants' further knowledge in specific paired-comparisons  adherence to the prediction of the rh is non-diagnostic
MISC	or  as broder and schiffer  citation  put it   simple counting of choices compatible with a model tells us almost nothing about the underlying strategy  p  number 
MISC	indeed  unconfounding different cues is vital when considering the adherence to simple one-cue strategies  citation
MISC	this bayesian approach provides information about the decision strategy that most likely generated a data vector
MISC	recently  this approach has been extended to considering choice outcomes  response latencies  and confidence ratings  citation
MISC	however  both these elegant approaches necessitate teaching or providing all cue patterns for a set of artificial objects  so as to discriminate between different strategies
MISC	clearly  this is at odds with the central methodological recommendations of pachur et al citation  who call for using naturally recognized objects without teaching or providing any further information
OWNX	how  based on these pieces of information  can we measure rh-use
MISC	so far  three classes of measures have been applied  viz
MISC	the adherence rate  enhanced measures based on adherence rates  and a formal measurement model
MISC	several approaches to judgment and decision making emphasize the effort-reducing properties of heuristics
MISC	one prominent example for effort-reduction is the recognition heuristic rh which proposes that judgments are made by relying on one single cue recognition  ignoring other information
OWNX	we propose that intuitive thinking is fast  automatic  and effortless whereas deliberative thinking is slower  stepwise  and more effortful
OWNX	in two city-size-experiments  we instructed participants to think either intuitively or deliberatively and assessed use of the rh through a formal measurement model
OWNX	as such  we conclude that the potential application of heuristics is not necessarily a consequence of  intuitive  processing
MISC	heuristics are meant to reduce effort
MISC	indeed  without the issues of processing effort or information search costs  there would be little need for examining fewer cues  reducing the difficulty of storing and or retrieving cue values  simplifying weighting principles for cues  or integrating less information - all of which characterize heuristic strategies  citation
MISC	following the pioneering work of herbert simon  citation   most approaches to judgment and decision making dealing with heuristic processing specifically emphasize its simplifying properties  citation  - though there is some discourse as to whether heuristics are generally less accurate than complex strategies
MISC	however  despite such disagreements  many would concur that heuristics render judgments and decisions easier in one way or another
MISC	how does heuristic processing relate to the concept of intuitive thinking
MISC	to answer this question - which is treated differently in the literature - one must first specify the characteristics of intuition
MISC	as such  intuitive  processes have little or no information-processing costs   citation  and  enable individuals to quickly integrate multiple reasons in their decisions in a compensatory way   citation
MISC	finally  intuition is typically contrasted with deliberation which describes slow  effortful  stepwise  and mostly rule-governed processes  citation
MISC	note however  that it is not entirely clear whether intuitive and deliberative thinking actually represent two qualitatively different modes of thinking or rather end points of the same dimension  citation
MISC	if one accepts these two basic notions  namely a that one central appeal of heuristics lies in their effort-reducing properties and b that intuitive thinking is more effortless than deliberation thus rendering effort-reduction less appealing  the following conjecture seems straightforward  deliberation will increase the  need  for heuristic processing
MISC	stated differently  heuristics should be much more helpful when judgments and decisions are performed in a slow  stepwise  and effortful manner  that is  under conditions of deliberation
MISC	in such a situation  heuristics may significantly relieve the mind of burdensome computations - without necessarily leading to reduced accuracy  citation
MISC	intuitive thinking  however  will comprise  automatic information integration  which makes simplification partially obsolete   citation
MISC	indeed  some have considered heuristic processing in the sense of attribute substitution as the result of intuitive thinking  citation   though they acknowledge that  attribute substitution can also be a deliberate    strategy   citation
MISC	also  although focusing on single-cue mechanisms rather than on attribute substitution  gigerenzer  citation  stated that  heuristics can be used with and without awareness
MISC	similarly  gigerenzer  citation  seems to advocate that the fast-and-frugal heuristics of his adaptive toolbox approach are intuitive mechanisms    intuitions ignore information
MISC	gut feelings spring from rules of thumb that extract only a few pieces of information    and ignore the rest  p  number 
MISC	from these theoretical positions  it seems to be a largely open question
MISC	nonetheless  intuition and reliance on heuristics have often been equated in the past  citation
MISC	heuristics  by contrast  ignore information
OWNX	indeed  previous empirical findings are consistent with our conjecture
MISC	for example  glockner and betsch  citation  showed that individuals are capable of integrating complex information within a surprisingly short time frame
MISC	measuring the reliance on more consciously controlled processes rather than automatic first impressions in risky choices using the cognitive reflection test  citation   cokely and kelly  citation  showed that more reflective thinking is characterized by more heuristic search processes
MISC	similarly  frederick  citation  proposed that choice heuristics result from more deliberate cognitive processes e g   elimination-by-aspects  but can become automated when affective responses are rapidly generated e g   choosing-by-liking
MISC	other studies  directly inducing intuitive vs deliberative thinking  revealed that heuristics are more likely applied in deliberate rather than in intuitive judgments
MISC	for example  asking participants to think carefully increased reliance on the anchoring heuristic
MISC	similar results have been reported for frequency judgments  citation   basketball predictions  citation   and judgments of randomness  citation
MISC	the turkish students made forecasts for some of the matches with additional information-the half-time scores
MISC	how does knowledge affect judgment and decision-making
MISC	while much judgment research has considered the role of expertise  goldstein and gigerenzer  citation  have made the startling claim that  under certain circumstances  ignorance can benefit judges attempting to make inferences from their knowledge
MISC	for example  goldstein and gigerenzer  citation  asked both american and german students which is the bigger city  san antonio or san diego
MISC	all of the german students had heard of san diego but only about half had heard of san antonio
MISC	half of the german students would therefore be able to apply a recognition heuristic-if you recognise one and not the other  pick the city you recognise
MISC	as people usually hear about the bigger cities of foreign countries before the smaller ones-i e   recognition correlates with the criterion being predicted-this cue will have some validity
MISC	because the american students had heard of both cities they couldn't utilise this cue and had to rely on other  apparently less valid  cues
MISC	in terms of accuracy  it seems that  when it comes to using knowledge to make inferences  less can sometimes mean more
MISC	specifically  when the validity of the recognition cue exceeds the validity of the knowledge that can be applied when both items are recognised  a  less is more  effect is predicted
MISC	to corroborate this  less is more  effect  goldstein and gigerenzer  citation  administered two quizzes to  number  university of chicago students-one about the biggest  number  german cities and one about the biggest  number  american cities
OWNX	each quiz was comprised of  number  randomly selected pairs of the biggest  number  cities for the country
MISC	furthermore  goldstein and gigerenzer  citation  cited hoffrage  citation  who apparently found that german students were slightly more accurate albeit non-significantly at making decisions about american cities than about german cities
MISC	despite a lifetime of experience and learning about the cities in one's native country it seems that one can be more accurate when making decisions about the cities in a country that is considerably less familiar
MISC	in another experiment to confirm that the recognition heuristic predicted inferences goldstein and gigerenzer  citation  found that subjects adhered to the predictions of the recognition heuristic on  number  percent  of the occasions that it was applicable and concluded that the recognition heuristic captured the vast majority of inferences
MISC	the more general theoretical point that goldstein and gigerenzer  citation  drew from these demonstrations is that a very simple one-reason heuristic using very limited knowledge can make surprisingly accurate decisions
MISC	even ignorance can sometimes be helpful because a simple mental heuristic like the recognition heuristic operates so as to take advantage of the structure of information to make good inferences
MISC	in particular  the recognition heuristic is successful when ignorance  specifically a lack of recognition  is systematically rather than randomly distributed  that is  when it is strongly correlated with the criterion
MISC	of particular interest to us here is goldstein and gigerenzer's  citation  suggestion that the recognition heuristic uses a noncompensatory rule
MISC	even when other information about a recognized alternative is available  it never overrides the weight placed on simple recognition   if one object is recognized and the other is not  then the inference is determined  no other information about the recognized object is searched for and  therefore  no other information can reverse the choice determined by recognition   citation
MISC	consistent with their suggestion that the recognition heuristic utilises a non-compensatory decision rule  goldstein and gigerenzer  citation  reported evidence that use of the recognition cue was unaffected by the presence of other conflicting information
MISC	yet  when confronted with a choice between a city they recognised and knew did not have a soccer team and one they did not recognise but that might have a soccer team  respondents chose the recognised city in  number  percent  of the pairs
MISC	thus  additional diagnostic information about soccer teams and city sizes had no measurable impact on decisions where the recognition heuristic was applicable
MISC	a number of subsequently published studies clearly show that recognition  at least in a general sense  plays a role in prediction  citation  including for soccer matches  citation
MISC	these studies did not test the non-compensatory use of recognition-critical for distinguishing the recognition heuristic from similar but distinct proposals such as the availability heuristic  citation   which attribute judgment to the relative ease of retrieval  or the fluency heuristic  citation   which assumes the most fluently processed item has the highest criterion value
MISC	nevertheless other studies have challenged the non-compensatory use of recognition
MISC	for example newell and shanks  citation  found in two cue-learning experiments that people did not place any special status on recognition
MISC	most of their subjects learned to use recognition-based information when it was a good predictor and to essentially ignore it when it was a poor predictor
MISC	they found little evidence that recognition is treated any differently from other cues in the environment
MISC	note that  although these results show that laboratory-induced recognition may be overruled by  given  information supplied by the experimenter  they do not show that natural pre-experimental recognition can be over-ruled by information drawn from memory
MISC	in their recent review of research into the recognition heuristic gigerenzer and goldstein  citation  discuss what they identify as  misunderstanding   number   pp  number - number  and emphasise that studies focusing on inferences from given information or experimentally induced recognition are beyond the domain of the recognition heuristic
MISC	newell and shanks's  citation  study and others that have tested the non-compensatory use of recognition  citation  have been criticised by pachur  broder  and  marewski  citation  who argued that most of the studies testing the non-compensatory use of recognition used experimental situations that differ in potentially critical ways from the situations for which goldstein and gigerenzer  citation  formulated the heuristic
MISC	moreover  according to pachur et al   research should test cases where recognition is a good predictor of the criterion and also preclude the possibility that knowledge other than cue knowledge could inform decisions-conclusive criterion knowledge e g   knowing that a recognized city is very small and so guessing that another unrecognized city is bigger could allow decision makers to make judgments without engaging in the inductive inference that goldstein and were theorizing about
MISC	while this issue was not referred to by goldstein and gigerenzer  citation   it was mentioned in gigerenzer and goldstein  citation   which first introduced the recognition heuristic
MISC	it is further emphasized by gigerenzer and goldstein  citation   who identify the presumption that the recognition heuristic applies to inferences from  givens  as a misconception and describe tests of the recognition heuristic using inferences from given information as going  beyond the domain of the recognition heuristic 
MISC	although their own test of the impact of conflicting information tested subjects' use of given information and an experimenter-supplied cue validity  citation  it did not provide what gigerenzer and goldstein  citation  describe as cue information about unrecognized objects-which may be why goldstein and gigerenzer  citation  made no reference to the notion that their own test was beyond the domain of the recognition heuristic
MISC	indeed they concluded   this result supports the hypothesis that the recognition heuristic was applied in a noncompensatory way  p  number 
OWNX	in our first study we examined the judgmental predictions of two different groups of subjects who  like the american and german students studied by goldstein and gigerenzer  would be expected to have different knowledge of a domain
OWNX	we studied turkish and english students' predictions of english soccer matches
OWNX	although predicting soccer matches is not quite the same as making inferences about city sizes  we were able to test the accuracy of subjects' predictive inferences by comparing the forecasts with the outcomes of the games
OWNX	we were also able to study the effect of providing additional diagnostic information on the turkish subjects' judgments
MISC	in a series of three experiments  participants made inferences about which one of a pair of two objects scored higher on a criterion
OWNX	the first experiment was designed to contrast the prediction of probabilistic mental model theory  citation  concerning sampling procedure with the hard-easy effect
MISC	the experiment failed to support the theory's prediction that a particular pair of randomly sampled item sets would differ in percentage correct  but the observation that german participants performed practically as well on comparisons between u s cities many of which they did not even recognize than on comparisons between german cities about which they knew much more ultimately led to the formulation of the recognition heuristic
MISC	experiment  number  was a second  this time successful  attempt to unconfound item difficulty and sampling procedure
OWNX	in experiment  number   participants' knowledge and recognition of each city was elicited  and how often this could be used to make an inference was manipulated
MISC	choices were consistent with the recognition heuristic in about  number  percent  of the cases when it discriminated and people had no additional knowledge about the recognized city and in about  number  percent  when they had such knowledge
MISC	the frequency with which the heuristic could be used affected the percentage correct  mean confidence  and overconfidence as predicted
MISC	the history of science and technology repeatedly demonstrates that many laws are discovered and many inventions are made serendipitously  as a by-product when researchers are striving for something else
MISC	at the outset of this part  a brief summary of pmm theory is given
MISC	experiment  number  is then reported  which was conducted to address one of the criticisms of the theory  namely the confounding of sampling procedure and item difficulty
OWNX	specifically  we compared over underconfidence in two item sets that were generated by the same sampling procedure but were nevertheless supposed to differ with respect to percentage correct
MISC	this attempt failed  yielding the counter-intuitive finding that german participants performed about the same when making comparisons between german cities as when making comparisons between u s cities
MISC	experiment  number  reports a second  and this time successful  attempt to unconfound item difficulty and sampling procedure in order to answer the question that motivated experiment  number 
MISC	the second part is also historical  it reports experiment  number   which provides  to the best of my knowledge  the first empirical test of the recognition heuristic
MISC	it was designed to find out whether the results obtained in experiment  number  could be explained by participants having used the recognition heuristic
OWNX	in this experiment  the participants' knowledge and recognition of each city was elicited  and how often this could be used to make an inference was manipulated
OWNX	we also manipulated the inclusion criterion and  in turn  the size of the reference class that the cities were drawn from when constructing the paired comparisons
MISC	the overall findings on the processes that underlie this fast and frugal heuristic are somewhat mixed  and many studies have expressed the need for considering a more compensatory integration of recognition information
MISC	regardless of the mechanism involved  it is clear that recognition has a strong influence on choices  and this finding might be explained by the fact that recognition cues arouse affect and thus receive more attention than cognitive cues
OWNX	we found that recognition of cities does not directly result in increased physiological arousal
MISC	moreover  the results show that physiological arousal increased with increasing inconsistency between recognition information and additional cue information
MISC	these findings support predictions derived by a compensatory parallel constraint satisfaction model rather than predictions of noncompensatory models
MISC	additional results concerning confidence ratings  response times  and choice proportions further demonstrated that recognition information and other cognitive cues are integrated in a compensatory manner
MISC	imagine a business trip to a city you have never visited before
MISC	you make a few phone calls and find two hotels with vacancies  both at a similar rate
MISC	you know nothing else about these hotels  however  you do recognize the name of one of them
MISC	which hotel would you choose
MISC	more specifically  according to gigerenzer and colleagues  citation   individuals are equipped with several tools i e   fast and frugal heuristics that exploit the structure of the environment  some of which rely solely on one piece of information at a time on the road to reaching a decision
MISC	indeed  it has been shown repeatedly that people actually prefer recognized objects over unrecognized ones  and that such behavior may lead to rather accurate inferences  citation
MISC	nevertheless  several studies challenge the claim that recognition information is used in a noncompensatory manner as predicted by the rh  citation
MISC	for example  in oppenheimer  citation   broder and eichler  citation   and richter and spath  citation   additional information has been found to affect the proportion of choices that followed recognition
MISC	while it has been argued that several of these studies suffer from methodological limitations  citation   their findings nonetheless highlight the need for considering a more compensatory integration of recognition information
MISC	moreover  studies on the rh have focused mainly on choice behavior
MISC	yet  since the choice predictions made by different models often overlap  citation   it is difficult to draw clear conclusions concerning the underlying cognitive processes
MISC	several recent studies have attempted to address this problem  for example by testing hypotheses concerning process measures such as decision time  citation   and by additionally investigating confidence glockner  and  broder  in press
MISC	yet  additional research is needed to disentangle the role of recognition information in decision making  as well as to examine the cognitive processes underlying its use in inferences and choice behavior
OWNX	we derived concurring predictions on the basis of a noncompensatory perspective  and juxtapose these with contradicting predictions derived from a compensatory model
MISC	it has been argued that recognition information  like other affective signals  might be generated automatically  citation   and that it may override cognitive information  citation
MISC	the pcs model assumes that information integration is based on automatic-intuitive processes - akin to perception  citation  - by which consistent interpretations of decision tasks are constructed
MISC	available information is taken into account according to its importance  and the advantages of the emerging preferred option are highlighted by systematic information distortions  citation
MISC	the formalized pcs model includes four possible steps
MISC	first  when presented with a decision task  related information is activated to form a mental representation of the task
MISC	second  automatic processes of pcs lead to maximization of consistency by automatically highlighting information supporting the favored alternative and at the same time suppressing contradicting information
MISC	third  the decision maker evaluates the choice alternatives  and if one alternative clearly dominates the other i e   if there is enough information in favor of this alternative  this alternative is chosen
MISC	among other things  the pcs model is supported by research that shows that unconscious modifications of the available information occur during decision processes  citation
MISC	this study directly tests the hypothesis that  at least within the domains of food and drink for americans  the judgment of naturalness has more to do with the history of an object  that is the processes that it has undergone  as opposed to its material content
MISC	individuals rate the naturalness and acceptability of a natural entity water or tomato paste  that same entity with a first transformation in which a natural substance is added or some part removed  and then a second transformation in which the natural additive is removed or the removed part is replaced
MISC	the twice transformed entity is stipulated to be identical to the original natural entity  yet it is rated much less natural and less acceptable
MISC	it differs from the original entity only in its history the reversed processes it has experienced
MISC	the twice transformed entity is also rated as less natural than the once-transformed entity  even though the former is identical to the original natural entity  and the latter is not
MISC	therefore  naturalness depends heavily on the process-history of an entity
MISC	 natural  is an attribute that seems to generally improve the perception of the entity to which it is applied
MISC	natural foods are generally considered more desirable  and worth more  than corresponding  non-natural    artificial  or  processed  alternatives  citation
MISC	this is perhaps most obvious in the food domain  but natural preference extends to other entities  including fabrics  medicines in some cases  and environments
MISC	the appeal of  natural  may be universal or almost universal  in some domains
MISC	there is direct evidence for its appeal in western cultures in the food domain
MISC	for example  in five european countries and the united states  free associations to the word  natural  are almost entirely positive  citation
MISC	there has been some attention to matters related to  natural  in the psychology and risk literatures
MISC	much of this has been motivated by opposition to genetic engineering  particularly of foods
MISC	naturalness  or perception of naturalness  has been identified in a number of lines of research  much of it based on the framings of risk and toxins provided by slovic  citation
MISC	psychometric studies on the attributes of varied technologies confirm that a two-dimensional description of familiarity and dread account for much of the variation in response to food risks  citation   and there are indications that some of the opposition to technologies are based on fundamental concerns about the propriety and dangers of tampering with nature  citation
MISC	the focus of the literature has been on public assessment of health risks  and in this regard  there has been appropriate concern for the value of education of the public and involvement of the public in decision making  and understanding reasons for public distrust of relevant government and industry statements and regulations  citation
MISC	there has also been interest in identifying public attitudes to technology and more broadly  the natural world  that might predict which individuals are most opposed to modification of foods  citation
MISC	there are two types of justifications for  natural preference   instrumental and ideational  citation
MISC	it is this type of justification that has been the focus of most past research
MISC	ideational reasons come down to the claim that natural is inherently better  in moral and or aesthetic senses
MISC	we have found that although americans usually justify their natural preference in instrumental terms  when these are neutralized for example  by the claim that for a particular comparison  the natural and non-natural entities are chemically identical  natural preference usually remains substantially intact  citation
MISC	when challenged on their instrumental accounts  many informants acknowledge that natural is  just better
MISC	    an analysis of the properties of the concept  natural  for lay americans suggests that naturalness is relatively uncompromised by mixing of like natural entities  or changes in physical state such as freezing or crushing  citation
MISC	on the other hand  changes in substance  as by boiling or additions or subtractions of entities changes naturalness substantially
MISC	when something is added to or subtracted from a natural entity  the violation of its naturalness could result from the change in material substance  and or the process of intervention
MISC	there are suggestions that process may be more important than change in content
MISC	for example  a cocker spaniel is rated as only modestly less natural than a wolf  whereas a single gene insertion replacement in a variety of species has a massive effect on naturalness  citation
MISC	the idea that process is more important than content in judgments of naturalness needs further evidence and explication
MISC	the ideal comparison not carried out in previous research involves changes that only involve process  or only content
MISC	although it is not possible to imagine a change in content that is human-induced  but does not involve a process  it is possible to imagine action of human-caused processes  but with no change in substance
MISC	this is accomplished if something natural or unnatural is added to a  natural  entity  and then that same additive is removed  leaving the twice processed entity chemically identical to its natural origin form
MISC	the same can be accomplished by removal of something from a natural entity  and then having this subtracted entity replaced
OWNX	in this study  we explore judgments of naturalness  similarity  and acceptability of water and one food exemplar tomato paste which undergo this set of double manipulations addition then subtraction  or subtraction and then addition
MISC	previous research has identified important determinants of overall evaluations for experiences lived across time
MISC	by means of a novel guessing task  i study what decision-makers themselves consider important
MISC	as informants  some participants live and evaluate an experience
MISC	as guessers  others have to infer its overall evaluation by asking informants questions
MISC	results show that guessers thought of overall evaluations as reflecting average momentary impressions
MISC	moreover and alternatively  they tended to consider the personality and attitudes of the experiencing person  experience-specific holistic judgments and behavioral intentions regarding the experience
MISC	thus  according to lay intuitions  overall evaluations are more than a reflection of the experience's momentary impressions
MISC	people often report experiences by expressing a number on a scale
MISC	someone might say    number  out of  number  for this concert   or  in terms of painfulness  i rate this medical procedure as  number  out of  number 
MISC	   such overall evaluations of experiences have been shown to be important decision inputs  citation   and studied extensively
MISC	kahneman  wakker  and sarin  citation  suggested that experiences can be represented as intensity profiles of pleasure or discomfort over bounded intervals of time  i e   time profiles of  experienced utility
MISC	  experiments and field studies have shown that people evaluate more positively experiences with increasing  rather than decreasing time profiles at equivalent levels of total pleasure experienced  citation
MISC	there is a preference for steeper rates of improvement  citation   as well as variability in experience  citation
MISC	finally  the  peak-end rule  finding suggests that overall evaluations are best predicted by only two moments of the experience  the most pleasant unpleasant and final  citation
MISC	kahneman  wakker and sarin  citation  present a set of assumptions about experiences explaining why integration summation of all moments would be correct from a normative point of view
MISC	in contrast to previous research  the present work aims to reveal what decision makers themselves draw on as they think about overall evaluations of experiences
MISC	i will compare lay intuitions to what researchers have considered
MISC	this comparison may further enrich theories of overall evaluations  and suggest ways of testing them
MISC	the philosophy of the method is that of active information search  a method of naturalistic decision-making that huber  wider  and huber  citation  proposed for the study of risky choice
MISC	i report experiments in which participants had to guess the overall evaluation of an experience lived by another person
MISC	active information search was allowed prior to making the guess
MISC	the information participants sought was taken to reveal lay intuitions about the target overall evaluation
MISC	research in judgment and decision making generally ignores the distinction between factual and subjective feelings of ownership  tacitly assuming that the two correspond closely
MISC	this allowed us to disentangle the effects of these two factors  which are typically confounded
OWNX	we found a significant effect of possession  but not of factual ownership  on monetary valuation of the object
MISC	thaler  citation  presented half the students in a class with cornell university coffee mugs and then allowed them to trade with their less fortunate classmates
MISC	surprisingly little trading occurred
MISC	those holding the mugs set their minimum selling prices too high  and those without mugs set their maximum offers too low  for many trades to clear
MISC	apparently  briefly owning a coffee mug raised its value to the owner sufficiently to price it beyond the reach of most non-owners
MISC	the non-owner's potential gain from acquisition was apparently smaller than the owner's potential loss from sale
MISC	the effect has since been widely replicated  citation
MISC	the endowment effect is commonly interpreted as the result of loss aversion  a core ingredient of prospect theory  citation
MISC	losses outcomes below some reference point are weighted substantially more than gains outcomes above the reference point in the evaluation of choice options  citation
MISC	if one does not  the prospect of acquiring it is seen as a relatively small gain
MISC	hence the small volume of trading in thaler's study  the endowment shifted reference points  and thus the assessment of what is a loss and what a gain
MISC	more recently  researchers have started to examine in more detail the psychological mechanisms driving the effect
MISC	for example  strahilevitz and loewenstein  citation  found that valuation of an object can increase with duration of ownership  possibly due to increased adaptation  the psychological accustoming to the new material situation
MISC	novemsky and kahneman  citation  present evidence that loss aversion  and thus an endowment effect  is found for goods that are owned for consumption  but not for goods that are owned for exchange  and that are thus given up  as intended  rather than as losses from an endowment
OWNX	in the present research  we try to elucidate further what leads to the development of a sense of endowment and  subsequently  to higher monetary valuations
MISC	the concept of ownership of one's endowment of goods appears to involve two elements  legal entitlement and subjective ownership
MISC	these elements may be imperfectly correlated
MISC	one may feel some sense of ownership of items one does not own e g   a borrowed bicycle and behave as an owner might e g   resenting the owner's demand for its return
MISC	pierce  kostova and dirks  citation  propose an elaborate psychological model  based on an extensive literature review  of the antecedents  experiences  and consequences of psychological or subjective ownership  citation
MISC	this research suggests that subjective feelings of ownership are more complex than simple legal entitlement  citation
MISC	in the pierce et al model feelings of ownership are induced by controlling the entity e g   through possession  becoming familiar with it e g   through actual or imagined use and or investing the self into it e g   through identification
MISC	in thaler  citation   as in most studies of the endowment effect  two of these elements of ownership are confounded
MISC	it seems clear that the students who received the mugs understood that they legally owned them and could  if they wished  sell them to others
MISC	the extent to which these elements led to feelings of subjective ownership is unclear
MISC	possession alone  even in the absence of factual ownership  can induce feelings of ownership  citation
MISC	indeed  because of the immediate control it provides over the entity  possession might be more psychologically salient and have a stronger effect on feelings of ownership of an object and thus on its monetary evaluation than does factual ownership  citation
OWNX	we expect that possession will induce stronger feelings of ownership than pure factual ownership as such
OWNX	we are arguing that it is this subjective sense of endowmentrather than a legal entitlementthat leads to a shift in the reference point and makes not having the object feel like a loss  rather than a foregone gain
MISC	people are often more likely to accept risky monetary gambles with positive expected values when the gambles will be played more than once
OWNX	we investigated whether this distinction between single-play and multiple-play gambles extends to medical treatments for individual patients and groups of patients
MISC	resident physicians and medical students n    number  and undergraduates n    number  ranked  number  different flu shots and a no-flu-shot option in  number  of  number  combinations of perspective individual patient vs group of  number  patients and uncertainty frame probability vs frequency
MISC	the rank of the no-flu-shot option a measure of preference for treatment vs no treatment was not significantly related to perspective or participant population
MISC	the main effect of uncertainty frame and the interaction between perspective and uncertainty frame approached significance  number   number  greater than p greater than  number   number   with the no-flu-shot option faring particularly poorly treatment faring particularly well when decisions about many patients were based on frequency information
MISC	these results and those of other studies suggest that medical treatments for individuals and groups are not analogous to single-play and multiple-play monetary gambles  perhaps because many people are unwilling to aggregate treatment outcomes over patients in the same way that they would compute net gains or losses over monetary gambles
MISC	a convincing body of research demonstrates that people often make different choices when making multiple-play decisions than when making single-play decisions
MISC	subsequently  several studies have indicated that people are more likely to accept mixed gambles i e   gambles involving a possible gain and a possible loss with positive expected values evs when the gambles will be played more than once  citation   although the opposite result has been also been observed  citation
MISC	although the rationality of making different choices for single-play and multiple-play gambles has been debated  citation   this article is concerned primarily with the empirical distinction
MISC	related research shows that multiple plays may also increase the attractiveness of higher-ev unmixed gambles  citation   reduce the incidence of certainty and possibility effects  citation   reduce choosing pricing preference reversals  citation   reduce the  illusion of control   citation   and facilitate the multiplicative combination of probabilities and outcomes  citation
MISC	taken together  these results indicate that choices and preferences are often more consistent with expected value theory and or expected utility theory when multiple plays are considered
MISC	are people willing to gamble more for themselves than what they deem reasonable for others
OWNX	we addressed this question in a simplified computer gambling task in which subjects chose from a set of  number  cards
OWNX	subjects selected one card at a time after being instructed that  number  cards were good win a dollar per card and one was really bad lose all the money and end the game
MISC	subjects could stop playing at any time to collect their winnings
MISC	some subjects played the game  others observed a confederate
MISC	both groups took risks beyond what was rational i e    number  cards but  textit actors  were riskier than  textit observers 
MISC	the actor observer asymmetry occurred even after controlling for monetary outcome i e   having observers win prizes and after controlling for how the question was framed i e   asking observers what they themselves  textit would  do as opposed to what the confederate  textit should  do
MISC	you are at the casino watching a game of black jack  when a player who has a hand of sixteen asks for another card
MISC	you quip to yourself  what an idiot
MISC	he should have held at  number 
MISC	  but who's to say you wouldn't have done the same
MISC	after all  decision making for the self is likely to depend on cues and processes that are not available when judging the choices of others
MISC	the reward of having drawn a good card  the prospect of winning  the potential regret of overreaching  all are blunted to a detached observer
MISC	then again  you may reach the same decision whether you are an actor or observer  as much of the information needed  including success probability  prize size  and potential loss are all available for a  rational  choice
MISC	as this example illustrates  decision making is influenced both by rational and experiential factors  citation
MISC	the rational processes are effortful and logical  using a cost benefit analysis to determine the best choice  citation
MISC	in contrast  the experiential processes are intuitive and emotionally-based  using heuristics and the history of reward and punishment to determine the next behavior  citation
MISC	presumably  experiential processes weigh more heavily in actors' decisions than in observers' judgments  citation
MISC	one reason for this is that actors may have privileged access to their own affective reactions  citation
MISC	furthermore  actors' affective system is tapped by rewards and punishments  citation
MISC	in contrast  observers usually are not affected by these and  when they are  the influence of rewards and punishments is diminished by their being decoupled from the action
MISC	in simple terms  it can be argued that rewarded actions will show a tendency to be repeated
MISC	thus  the occurrence of reward should motivate actors to repeat the rewarded action with disregard for the potential costs and beyond what observers would deem reasonable
OWNX	in the current study  we explored this specific instance of the actor observer asymmetry and its relation to the rational experiential dichotomy
OWNX	for this  we used a modified version of a task first developed for studying risk taking in children  citation
MISC	in this paradigm  ten cards were displayed on the computer screen and subjects were told that nine cards were good and would pay a dollar each  while one card was disastrous and would make them lose all the money they had collected thus ending the game
MISC	subjects turned one card at a time and decided when to stop to collect their prize
MISC	the task could be solved by deciding in advance how many cards to turn  or sequentially by deciding whether to turn the next card
MISC	either way  the expected value in this task is highest for turning five cards  citation
MISC	thus  a rational decision maker should stop after turning  number  cards
MISC	decision making research often dichotomises between more deliberative  cognitive processes and more heuristic  intuitive and emotional processes
MISC	however the convergent concepts of experience-based metacognitive judgements  citation  and of fringe consciousness  citation  can clarify intuitive processing as an informative conscious feeling without conscious access to the antecedents of the feeling
MISC	this is illustrated with an example from research on implicit learning where intuitive feelings may play an important role in peoples' decisions and judgements
OWNX	finally we suggest that our approach to understanding intuitive feelings softens rather than reinforces the two-systems dichotomy
MISC	the influential two-systems framework  within decision making and judgement research  dichotomises between processes that are characterised as heuristic  affective  and intuitive  versus those that are seen as more deliberative  cognitive  and rational
MISC	kahneman  citation  declares there is considerable agreement over the properties of these systems which for s number  include being fast  automatic  effortless  associative  and difficult to control or modify  and which for s number  include being slower  serial  effortful  deliberately controlled  and relatively flexible
AIMX	citation  despite a tendency to associate s number  with non-conscious processing and s number  with conscious processing  we suggest that within representative formulations of this two-systems framework  such as kahneman's  citation  summary of his nobel prize winning work and epstein's  citation  seminal paper  there is considerable ambiguity over how to map the system  number  system  number  axis and the notion of intuitive processing onto the distinction between conscious and non-conscious processes
MISC	an experienced decision aider reflects on how misaligned priorities produce decision research that is less useful than it could be
OWNX	 number  years ago many of us thought we were on the brink of a new era  thanks to emerging decision analysis tools  we could look forward to a brave new world  where we would no longer make foolish mistakes that ruin our lives
MISC	so far  nothing like that is remotely in sight  and i don't expect it ever will be
MISC	however  i still believe that decision aiding  and prescriptive decision analysis in particular  can become a major force for good in the world  but it will take an upheaval in how decision tools are fashioned and how they are used
MISC	it won't come about spontaneously  because the root problem is not technique  but motivation  which is notoriously difficult to correct
MISC	a lot of important decision research is being done  but not very much of it is helping decision aiding to get used and be useful
MISC	i think that can be turned around  but it won't be easy
MISC	some studies have found that choices become more risk averse after gains and more risk seeking after losses  although other studies have found the opposite
MISC	the latter tend to use hypothetical cases that encourage deliberation
OWNX	in the current study  we examined the effects of prior gains and losses on a task designed to encourage less reflective decision making  the iowa gambling task igt
OWNX	fifty participants conducted a manipulated decision-making task in which one group gained money  whereas the other group lost money  followed by the igt
MISC	participants who experienced a prior monetary loss displayed more risky choice behavior on the igt than subjects who experienced a prior gain
MISC	these effects were not mediated by a positive or negative affect  although the sample size may have been too small to detect a small effect
MISC	kahneman and tversky  citation  noted that people are often risk averse for gains and risk seeking for losses
MISC	whether people consider a consequence of their choice as a loss or as a gain is dependent on their point of reference
MISC	this reference point  which is often equivalent to the current wealth position  plays a key role in the theory of choice
MISC	it should be possible to manipulate perceptions of the domain gain or loss with actual prior gains or losses
MISC	if they had lost money  for example  they may see new gambles as in the domain of losses  and they therefore might be risk seeking
MISC	earlier studies of the effect of gains and losses show conflicting results
MISC	thaler and johnson  citation  found the opposite resultswhich they called a  house money effect although their participants would take risks to gain back all of their loss
MISC	weber and zuchel  citation  review this literature and find some conditions that support the prospect theory prediction
MISC	aside from their result  however  most of the results consistent with prospect theory are from studies that use more realistic situations such as investment  rather than hypothetical tasks
MISC	these kinds of choices can be characterized as deliberate  and carefully thought-out
MISC	however  some recent psychological studies addressing decision-making show that decisions can also be driven by less carefully thought-out choices  citation   are often implicit and automatic  citation   and are based on  gut-feelings   citation  or emotions  citation
MISC	recently  sanfey et al citation  made a clear distinction between these two psychological systems involved in economic decision-making  an emotional system  which involves the activation of automatic processes and a deliberative system involving controlled processes  with each having separate neural substrates
OWNX	in the present contribution  we want to apply this recent knowledge to risk aversion
MISC	is risk aversion after gains the consequence of people's deliberate  conscious decisions to avoid risk
OWNX	in the present study we examined the role of reference point in a task designed to encourage automatic  emotional driven decision-making  the iowa gambling task igt
MISC	during the igt participants have to select cards from four decks that range in probability and magnitude of rewards and punishments  citation
OWNX	to translate our hypothesis pertaining to risk aversion to the igt  it is necessary to explain the igt in some detail
MISC	in the igt  participants can repeatedly choose usually up to  number  times between four decks of cards
MISC	two of the decks e g   a and b are disadvantageous
MISC	they produce large immediate gains  but these gains are followed by large losses  leading to an overall loss in the long run
MISC	the gains are modest but consistent and the losses are small
MISC	consistently choosing these decks leads to gains in the long run
MISC	this means that people who are risk seeking would be predominantly choose decks a and b  leading to losses in the long run
MISC	conversely  people who are risk averse will predominantly choose decks c and d  leading to overall gain
MISC	this means that risk aversion translates into better performance overall gains on the igt  whereas risk seeking would translate into poor performance overall losses
MISC	a general consensus is that people performing the igt at some point steer towards certain profitable decks  in rather automatic way
MISC	whether this automatic behavior is entirely unconscious is still subject to debate  see maia and mcclelland  citation   and dunn et al citation
MISC	behavior on the igt can be seen as a form of implicit learning  citation   whereby behavior changes before people can verbalize why they do what they are doing
MISC	therefore  the igt can be regarded as an instrument capable of assessing intuitive and emotion-based decision-making processes
OWNX	in addition to our central aimto test the relative automaticity of risk aversionwe have another goal
MISC	economic studies addressing theories of decision-making often rely on hypothetical situations and choices in which participants are confronted with monetary gambles without any real consequences
MISC	although the use of real incentives is often not crucial for the outcome of experiments  using real incentives has an important role to play in establishing the quality  credibility  and generalizability of experimental data  citation
OWNX	in the present study  we addressed this point by using real monetary remunerations in order to mimic real-life decision-making more closely
OWNX	for the purpose of the present study  we experimentally manipulated the reference point
MISC	note that this experimental set-up comes close to real-life situations in which a person's reference point real or perceived is often the result of their prior choices
MISC	it is known that individual differences can influence behavioral decision-making
MISC	these individual difference variables include reward sensitivity  citation   gender  citation   and age  citation
OWNX	in line with previous research  citation   we expected that our experimental manipulation would have an effect on participants' affect
MISC	it has been suggested that affect might influence decision-making  citation
MISC	positive affect can promote increased sensitivity to losses  citation
MISC	the main hypothesis was that people who experienced a prior gain on a gambling task performed better i e   made more advantageous choices as a consequence of risk aversion on the igt as compared to persons who experienced a prior loss
OWNX	furthermore  we asked whether this effect was influenced by subjective affect  and various other individual differences
MISC	individuals are generally reluctant to trade goods-a phenomenon identified as the endowment effect
OWNX	three studies demonstrate that individuals are more willing to exchange less vivid lottery tickets e g   tickets concealed in envelopes  or tickets with an unknown number compared to more vivid tickets e g   tickets not concealed in envelopes  or tickets with a known number when offered an incentive to exchange
MISC	moreover  this effect is mediated by anticipated regret  such that less regret is anticipated when exchanging less vivid tickets  thus increasing individuals' willingness to exchange tickets
OWNX	throughout our lives we gamble
MISC	some gambles are explicit  like horse races or lottery tickets
MISC	others  like purchasing a house  getting on a plane  or getting married are more implicit
MISC	imagine  for example  that you have received a lottery ticket in a sealed envelope
MISC	what would you do
MISC	the rational thing is to exchange the tickets  since a ticket-plus-  number  is more valuable than a ticket
MISC	but  would you
MISC	would your decision to exchange be different if the ticket was not in a sealed envelope
MISC	the endowment effect literature  citation  would predict that people would not be willing to exchange due to the loss experienced from giving up a pre-owned object  citation
MISC	however  trade between identical goods should not evoke such a loss  and indeed  most people would exchange  for example  one pen for an identical pen  citation  or one candy for an identical one  citation  when offered a small incentive to do so
MISC	in contrast  people are generally reluctant to exchange lottery tickets with identical distribution  i e   tickets with an equal chance of winning  even when offered an incentive to do so  citation
MISC	according to bar-hillel and neter  citation  it is the anticipation of ex-post regret from exchanging the ticket and losing the lottery that prevents people from exchanging
MISC	for example  by going to an unfamiliar restaurant  or by ordering an exotic  non-traditional entree  one is gambling the quality of the food and the nature of experience in that restaurant
MISC	once people have chosen a gamble  let it be a restaurant  an entree  or insurance plan  would they be reluctant to trade them  as they would be when offered to trade other goods
MISC	that is  when it is easy to imagine the consequences of the gamble e g   winning a lottery  one is likely to anticipate greater regret from exchanging that gamble and possibly changing the consequences of the gamble e g   losing the lottery as a result of the exchange
MISC	for example  when deciding among unfamiliar restaurants  being close to the restaurant as opposed to deciding when still at home  increases the vividness of the restaurants  making regret more salient  which in turn reduces likelihood of switching from one gamble  i e   restaurant  to another  even when offered an incentive to switch e g   a promotional offer
MISC	it is proposed that less vivid tickets evoke fewer thoughts about the tickets potentially winning the lottery and make it harder imagining the ticket winning
OWNX	the next section reviews the literature on the endowment effect  regret  and vividness
MISC	study  number  additionally tests the mediating role of anticipated regret when analyzing the effect of tickets' vividness on willingness to exchange them
MISC	researchers in the decision making tradition usually analyze multiple decisions within experiments by aggregating choices across individuals and using the individual subject as the unit of analysis
MISC	this approach can mask important variations and patterns within the data
MISC	specifically  it ignores variations in decisions across a task or game and possible influences of characteristics of the subject or the experiment on these variations
OWNX	we demonstrate  by reanalyzing data from two previously published articles  how a mixed model analysis addresses these limitations
MISC	experiments within the broad decision making tradition can involve subjects making multiple decisions  either with different partners or groups  citation  or as repeated decisions in a learning task  citation
MISC	analyses of these data typically involve examination of how the rewards received are related to characteristics of the experiment and or the individuals involved  citation
MISC	complex multivariate analyses are relatively rare
MISC	this typical analytic approach has at least one major drawback
MISC	most studies in this tradition involve multiple decisions for each individual
MISC	that is  each subject participates in several decisions
MISC	it is entirely possible that individuals vary their decisions across the rounds of play in which they engage
MISC	aggregated analyses do not allow the researcher to fully examine the ways in which characteristics of participants and the experimental design affect decisions
MISC	in other words  these analyses can provide descriptive results  but only hints of the decision-making dynamics within the experiments
MISC	mixed models have been specifically developed to deal with multi-level units of observation and can help us understand the process or dynamics of decision making within our studies
OWNX	we then demonstrate the use of these models with decision making data by reanalyzing data from two previously published articles
MISC	the first study  citation  involves a modification of the iowa gambling task with multiple decisions by individual players in response to a variety of stimuli  and the second  citation  involves prisoner dilemma games conducted within seven person groups
MISC	a mixed model is one in which there are both between- and within-subject variables
MISC	as noted above  studies in the decision research literature often focus exclusively on between-subject variables in their analyses and ignore within-subject variables  those that affect the variations in decisions that one individual makes
MISC	yet  variations in individuals' decisions are often theoretically and substantively important
MISC	in addition  mixed models are very flexible and can adapt to a wide variety of experimental designs
MISC	the first panel of table  number  illustrates this design  assuming that there are two different design elements a and b
MISC	in this design  each subject s participates in each condition of design element a a and design element b b
MISC	an example would be the classic lichtenstein and slovic  citation  study in which gamblers in a las vegas casino showed within-subject preference reversals based on response mode bids and choices
MISC	the pure between-subjects design is one in which each subject serves in only a single condition and there is no within-subject variation
MISC	this design is illustrated in the second panel of table  number   where each subject s is in only one condition of the two design conditions a and b
MISC	in other words  in the pure between- subjects design  subjects are nested within a and b  ab  each subject contributes a single observation on the dependent variable and thus appears in only a single treatment condition
MISC	many decision making studies use this design  citation  or simplify their data to mimic this design by summarizing across all of the decisions that an individual makes to form a summary score  citation
MISC	this summary number is then used as the dependent variable
MISC	researchers also use a design that involves repeated measures or conditions for one or more factors that are presented to each subject within-subject variables such as a set of rewards in a neuroimaging study and variables such as gender or culture or experimental conditions such as positive and negative frames that subjects do not share between-subject variables
MISC	this design is frequently referred to by psychologists as a mixed design and is illustrated in the third part of table  number   with b as the within- subjects factor and a as the between-subjects factor
MISC	the term mixed is particularly apt in that there are sources of variance that are produced by between-subjects differences and by within-subjects differences and both types of differences contribute to the statistical analysis
OWNX	this design allows us to assess within-subject differences at the same time as we study between-subject relationships
MISC	researchers have used mixed models in a variety of settings
MISC	much of the original work on mixed models was conducted in agricultural settings and thus  statisticians also refer to such models as a split-plot design
MISC	in the agricultural setting  plots were often considered random with each plot exposed to the same set of fixed experimental conditions on one of the experimental variables  while the plots were nested within experimental conditions of a different experimental variable
MISC	the panel models used by economists have both a between-units often firms component and a within-units changes over time component  citation
MISC	sociologists have used hierarchical linear models to examine the influence of characteristics of school classrooms and entire schools on individual student achievement  citation
MISC	developmental psychologists and educational researchers have used the models to examine  growth curves   changes in individuals' achievement or developmental characteristics the within-subject variable for students varying on different characteristics the between-subject analysis  citation
MISC	thus  there are a wide variety of analytical methods that pay close attention to within and between individual or group variables
MISC	two widely used general modeling strategies are hierarchical linear models and mixed models
MISC	either of these allows for the modeling of random variation for individuals and of decisions nested within individuals
MISC	within many such experiments  a given individual makes numerous choices  often across a variety of experimental settings
MISC	such a practice  however  ignores potential variation and limits the extent to which researchers can assess the impact of experimental variables on individual choice
MISC	it also encourages researchers to conduct numerous separate bivariate analyses
MISC	use of mixed models can provide both a more inclusive  yet more parsimonious and efficient  method of analysis
OWNX	we now illustrate the utility of these models by reanalyzing data from two different studies
MISC	the allais paradox  or common consequence effect  has been a standard challenge to normative theories of risky choice since its proposal over  number  years ago
OWNX	however  neither its causes nor the conditions necessary to create the effect are well understood
MISC	two experiments test the effects of losses and event splitting on the allais paradox
MISC	experiment  number  found that the allais paradox occurs for both gain and mixed gambles and is reflected for loss gambles produced by reflection across the origin
MISC	experiment  number  found that the allais paradox is eliminated by splitting the outcomes even when the probabilities used do not increase the salience of the common consequence
MISC	the results of experiment  number  are consistent with cumulative prospect theory  the current leading theory of risky choice
MISC	however  the results of experiment  number  are problematic for cumulative prospect theory and suggest that alternate explanations for the allais paradox must be sought
MISC	when expected utility theory eu was first proposed  citation  it was assumed that eu was not only the normative theory of risky decision making  but a descriptive theory as well
MISC	however it quickly became apparent that eu did not work as a descriptive theory of risky choice
MISC	one of the first and most famous challenges to eu was presented by allais in  number 
MISC	suppose one is given a choice between the following gambles       decision-makers  allais proposed  will generally choose the safer  certain gamble
MISC	however  when asked to choose between      decision-makers will generally chose the riskier gamble
MISC	thus  subjects' preference reversals are nonnormative
MISC	the allais paradox has been demonstrated under many different conditions  citation
MISC	it is a real and robust phenomenon  at least when it involves a standard presentation of large monetary gains
MISC	however  the literature on the results of varying the presentation of the paradox is mixed
MISC	the present experiments investigate two circumstances in which the leading explanation of the allais paradox  cumulative prospect theory cpt  predicts an allais common consequence effect should occur  but in which the effect has not always previously been found
MISC	experiment  number  addresses the issue of the allais paradox and losses  while experiment  number  investigates the effects of event splitting on the paradox
MISC	a number of explanations for the allais paradox have been advanced
MISC	these theories include fanning-out theories  which explain the paradox via the shape of indifference curves in the unit triangle  citation   and expected cardinality-specific utility theories  which speculate that the utility function varies with the number of outcomes  citation
MISC	the most common explanation for the paradox is that decision-makers weight the probabilities of outcomes via a p function that overweights small values of p and underweights large values of p  as in original prospect theory  citation
MISC	decision-makers are thus drawn to the safe gamble
MISC	the difference between them seems small  and decision-makers choose the more valuable  riskier gamble
MISC	under cumulative prospect theory  citation  the p function is not applied directly to the probability of an outcome but rather to the cumulative probabilities  the utility of the outcome is multiplied by pthe probability of obtaining an outcome at least as good as x minus pthe probability if an outcome strictly better   than x
MISC	thus  the weight given to an outcome depends not only on the probability and utility of the outcome itself  but also on how good the outcome is relative to the other possible outcomes of the gamble
MISC	rather than using cumulative probabilities  configural weight models  citation  directly weight the outcome according to its rank in the outcome set  with the smallest outcomes given the highest weight
MISC	by weighting smaller outcomes more heavily than larger ones  a configural weight model captures the intuition that people are more interested in avoiding the worst outcomes than they are in obtaining the best outcomes
MISC	for example  in the transfer of attentional exchange tax model  citation   each lower outcome  taxes  probability weight from each higher outcome
MISC	the tax model therefore explains the allais paradox primarily via the transfer of probability weights  in the three-outcome cc-high risky gamble  the highest outcome is weighted less than its probability alone would suggest  the middle outcome weighted somewhat less  and the lowest outcome more
MISC	the decision-maker thus prefers the safe gamble in the cc-high pair  which  as a single-outcome gamble  has an unaltered probability weight
MISC	in the cc-low gambles  both gambles have two outcomes
MISC	thus  the probability weights undergo similar changes in both gambles and decision-makers simply choose the better  higher-paying risky gamble
MISC	although the allais paradox has been demonstrated for a wide variety of monetary gains  the few studies that have used losses or mixed gambles have had conflicting results
MISC	camerer  citation  found a reverse allais paradoxthat is  greater risk-seeking for the cc-high gambles than for the cc-low gamblesfor losses obtained by subtracting a common amount from all the outcomes of small-magnitude gains gambles
OWNX	neither probability weighting theories nor the tax model predict a reverse paradox under such conditions
MISC	however  birnbaum  citation  obtained an allais paradox for mixed gambles obtained in the same manner
MISC	three other studies found no paradox for either losses or similarly sized gains  citation
MISC	thus  the literature is conflicting on the existence of allais paradox for losses
MISC	moreover  no studies that i am aware of have examined the effect of reflecting the paradox across the origin rather than shifting it
MISC	the question of the allais paradox for reflected loss gambles will be addressed by experiment  number 
MISC	under original pt  the effects of the split depend on whether the decision-maker chooses to coalesce the gambles during the editing stage
MISC	if so  the split gambles should be treated identically to the standard ones
MISC	if not  the split should serve to increase the desirability of the safe cc-low gamble as  number  percent  and  number  percent  considered separately seem larger than  number  percent  and decrease that of the risky cc-low gamble  thus eliminating the paradox
MISC	under the tax model  the split will also serve to increase the value of the safe cc-low gamble  the outcomes with the highest payout lose less weight to the lowest outcome when split into two outcomes than when coalesced as one outcome
MISC	at the same time  the value of the cc-low risky gamble decreases when split  as the highest outcome loses more weight to the lowest outcome when the lowest outcome is split
MISC	thus the tax model predicts that such a split should reduce or eliminate the paradox
MISC	such a manipulation is known as event splitting  citation
MISC	several studies have found that event splitting  or presentation formats that constitute event splitting  reduce violations of eu in allais paradox
MISC	citation   although other studies have failed to find an effect of presentation format  citation
MISC	the extent to which event splitting disrupts something fundamental to the paradox is unclear
MISC	it is possible that it simply makes the common consequence more obvious by separating out the shared probability of obtaining the lowest outcome  a possibility that could tested by splitting the gambles in a fashion that does not make the common consequence more apparent
MISC	birnbaum  citation  partially accomplished this by examining the effects of splitting only one of the two cc-low gambles
MISC	he found that splitting only the risky gamble which makes the common consequence most evident did not eliminate the allais paradox  while splitting only the safe gamble did
MISC	however  splitting one of the two cc-low gambles and not the other still means at least one of the outcomes is easily comparable across gambles
MISC	the effect of splitting the allais paradox cc-low gambles so that none of the outcomes may be easily compared is not known and will be examined in experiment  number 
MISC	however  what is important about the allais paradox is not the preference reversal itself  but rather the increase in risk seeking when the common consequence is removed
MISC	a set of two single-choice pairs can detect a shift in risk preference only if the presented gambles happen to span the shiftthat is  if the shift causes to decision-maker to prefer the safe cc-high gamble but the risky cc-low gamble
MISC	this limitation of the choice technique poses challenges for experimenters  if a manipulation produces a reduction in the number of subjects making the allais paradox pattern of choices  does it actually indicate a reduction in the common consequence effect  or have risk preference merely been changed overall
MISC	one aim of the present experiments was to examine the effects of sign and event splitting on the paradox using a matching technique more sensitive than the choice technique used in previous studies
MISC	professional judges in traffic courts sentence many hundreds of offenders per year
MISC	it remains remarkable that using only a fraction of the variables and combining them non-compensatorily  mh obtained nearly as good a fit as the weighing method
AIMX	this paper compares compensatory and non-conpensatory models as descriptions of how decisions are made in real-life settings by experienced practitioners
MISC	the study concerns traffic judges  and the punishment they mete out to alleged offenders brought in their court
MISC	judges in traffic courts are professional decision makers
MISC	their decisions are  for them  routine  and they handle dozens of cases every month
MISC	for the defendants appearing in court  the decisions are significant  involving sometimes hefty fines  driving license suspension or even prison
MISC	such a study  relying on actual cases of professional decision-making  contributes to the debate about the plausibilitiy of the fast and frugal heuristics as psychological models of cognition  citation
MISC	there is an extensive literature on how decision makers proceed when they have to rely on multiple cues to come to a decision
MISC	many researchers maintain that decisions makers do not rely on all the information available  or combine it in any sophisticated way
MISC	how simple or how complex are the judgments meted out
MISC	do traffic judges consider all the elements of the case
MISC	to what extent do they integrate all the information available to them
MISC	there are at least two causes for the superficial treatment of available information
MISC	people do not use an optimal approach because the proper integration of all the information available is beyond their mental powers
MISC	all humans have limited cognitive abilities  citation   and this fundamental difficulty is exacerbated by the conditions under which traffic court judges have to work
MISC	their workload is high  with only a few minutes available for a case  each characterized by some twenty parameters
MISC	strategy selection is contingent on task demands  citation
MISC	time pressure  and specifically the time available per variable has been shown to affect decision making  citation  resulting in fewer variables being considered and the replacement of complex cognitive strategies by simpler ones  citation  processing hundreds of cases month after month  traffic court judges acquire a vast experience
MISC	there is therefore reason to expect their decisions to settle into some pattern
MISC	however  and this is the second factor  they do not have the benefit of feedback  and this has important consequences
MISC	feedback on the appropriateness of one's decisions has been shown to be essential to developing good strategies  citation
MISC	in particular  while interactions are often ignored in multivariable decisions  citation  this is not the case when decision makers have habitual access to feedback on their decisions and care greatly about the outcome  citation
MISC	even if the judges knew what happened to the offenders they sentenced  they lack a clear criterion by which to evaluate the quality of their decision
MISC	judges have little incentive to develop complex decision rules
MISC	yet they surely do not render random judgments
MISC	instead of accuracy  they may strive for an adequate judgment  one that they consider appropriate to the circumstances and expresses their attitudes about each case
MISC	yet even if this criterion of adequacy replaces accuracy  it is unlikely that the judges attempt to reach the best possible decision in every case
MISC	since their task is routine and each case must be quickly dispatched lest the backlog increase  it is plausible they do not invest as much care as judges in higher courts  where stakes arehigher and acquaintance with the offender protracted
MISC	they may also use methods that are less well thought out than if resources were unlimited  motivation high and information complete
MISC	the comparison is based on what we call the linearity test  which examines whether appropriateness judgments are a linear function of the epidemiological value of p  the probability of deterioration of the patient condition if he would have received the treatment
MISC	this comparison allows for the assessment of the validity of the experts' judgments under the assumption that the decision analytic model is valid  or alternatively  the assessment of the validity of the decision analytic model under the assumption that the experts' judgments are valid
MISC	under the former assumption the results indicate that appropriateness judgments are by and large accurate
MISC	under the latter assumption the results support the idea of a constant treatment effect  the idea that efficacy of a treatment is constant over various levels of severity of the disease
MISC	appropriateness judgments such as  how appropriate it is to perform procedure x on a patient with symptoms y and z   which communicate information of how worthwhile it is to perform a medical procedure  play a major role in clinical guidelines systems  citation
MISC	these judgments can later be used by practitioners in deciding whether or not the treatment should be administered to their patients
MISC	there are three perspectives from which the relationship between a decision model and judgments of appropriateness could be understood
MISC	first  if the model is assumed to correctly describe the judgments  it could be used to uncover the implicit rules  or policies  underlying these judgments
MISC	this is a  policy capturing  view of judgment modeling  citation   primarily used to assess attribute weights in expert judgment  but also to determine the presence of configural i e   interactive or other nonlinear rules underlying judgment
MISC	third  if a set of appropriateness judgments are viewed as prescriptively accurate  agreement between the model and the judgments could be viewed as supporting the normative stand of the model and the basic tenets on which it is based
MISC	the term  appropriateness  is the common language analogue of the difference between the expected utility of taking an action and the expected utility of not taking that action
MISC	thus  when rating the appropriateness of a treatment as  number  on a  number  not appropriate at all to  number  very appropriate scale  the clinician implies that the expected utility of administering the treatment is slightly higher than the expected utility of not administering it  whereas when rating this appropriateness as  number   the clinician implies that the expected utility of administering this treatment is much higher than the expected utility of not administering it
MISC	as such  they should serve as a direct i e   linear indicator of utility  and deviations from linearity should be viewed as inappropriate
MISC	to use an example  consider a panel of experts who are asked to judge water temperature by sensing the water
MISC	appropriate temperature judgment in this case should be linearly related to temperature  and the a linearity test could be viewed as a test of their validity
MISC	consider now a clinician's judgment of the appropriateness of a treatment of a condition that has a probability of p  of deteriorating e g   death and  number -p  of remitting
MISC	assume that the treatment is associated with probability p of deteriorating p   less than  p   and a probability  number -p  of remitting
MISC	figure  number  depicts the decision tree facing the clinician
OWNX	in our model we assume that the probability of adverse events under treatment equals one
OWNX	we denote by u  the utility for remission and u  for deterioration death
MISC	thus  the difference between the expected utility of administering the treatment eu  and the expected utility of not administering it eu  is given by     number    if appropriateness judgment is a linear representation of du eu-eu  this assumption is further discussed below  then it could be expressed as     number    where app represents the level of appropriateness and a is a positive constant
MISC	the assumption that p  p k is constant is equivalent to asserting that the efficacy of a treatment is constant over various levels of severity of the disease or that the effect of the treatment in reducing mortality is constant over various levels of severity of the disease
MISC	for example  if treatment reduces the probability of mortality of patient a  whose initial probability of mortality is  number   number   by  number  percent  to  number   number  it will also reduce the probability of mortality of patient b  with an initial probability of  number   number   by  number  percent  to  number   number 
MISC	the constant treatment effect  although not necessarily universally true  may reasonably describe the effect of treatment in many situations
MISC	this assumption is made in many epidemiological studies
MISC	moreover  it is mandatory in epidemiological studies where the relative risk reduction is estimated by regression
MISC	therefore  policy capturing studies usually model appropriateness judgments as a function of the level of symptoms rather than p or any other relevant probabilities  citation
MISC	this approach has two disadvantages
MISC	first  it does not allow for relating the descriptive policy capturing model  based on symptoms  to a prescriptive decision analytic model  based on probabilities and utilities
MISC	second  the scales of the symptom levels may not be linear  thus introducing distortion into the interpretation of the results
MISC	in particular  it is not clear whether nonlinear relationships between the symptom and the judgment represent a nonlinear clinical rule or nonlinearity in the scale of the symptoms
MISC	this process could be viewed as an intervalization of the symptom scale
MISC	whereas the raw  number  to  number  scale is not necessarily an interval scale equal changes on the scale are not necessarily equivalent with respect to their impact  e g   a change from  number  to  number  may differ from a change from  number  to  number   the transformed scale is interval equal changes on the scale could be viewed as equivalent in terms of their impact
MISC	assessment of validity in medical judgments has taken primarily either the approach of comparing methods  citation   or examining whether the decision process suffers from biases  citation
MISC	a few studies have also examined the validity of appropriateness judgments by comparing them to normative models  citation
MISC	both need to be valid for linearity to occur
MISC	a basic question in medical decision making is whether aggregating the judgments of clinicians result in more valid clinical judgments
MISC	despite the fundamental importance of this question  not much relevant empirical evidence is available  primarily because of problems associated with the establishment of criteria that will allow the evaluation of the utility of the aggregation
OWNX	our discussion so far has focused on the validation of appropriateness judgments under the assumption that our decision analytic model is a valid model of the appropriateness of a medical treatment
MISC	however  as mentioned earlier  a complementary perspective emphasizes the validation of the model under the assumption that the appropriateness judgments are valid
MISC	in particular  if appropriateness judgments are assumed to be normatively valid and linearity is satisfied  the assumption of a constant treatment effect is supported
MISC	malignant melanoma is a common cancer in the western world
MISC	during the last  number  years  numerous agents have been evaluated in a series of both nonrandomized and randomized adjuvant therapy trials in melanoma
MISC	for patients who are in advanced stages of malignant melanoma  controversy abounds regarding high-dose adjuvant interferon alfa- number b therapy
MISC	in other words  relapse-free survival is  bought  at the price of increased frequency of serious toxicity
MISC	so the appropriateness judgments must revolve around the perceived tradeoff between harms and benefits
MISC	the present research aimed to test the role of mood in the iowa gambling task  citation
MISC	in the igt  participants can win or lose money by picking cards from four different decks
MISC	they have to learn by experience that two decks are overall advantageous and two decks are overall disadvantageous
MISC	previous studies have shown that at an early stage in this card-game  players begin to display a tendency towards the advantageous decks
OWNX	based on empirical evidence for the relation between mood and cognitive processing-styles  we expected and consistently found that  compared to a negative mood state  reported and induced positive mood states increased this early tendency towards advantageous decks
OWNX	our results provide support for the idea that a positive mood causes stronger reliance on affective signals in decision-making than a negative mood
MISC	when people make a decision  one thing they can do is rely on such affective reactions towards decision-options
OWNX	decision-makers can also base their decision on a cognition-based  rule-governed and precise analysis of the different options
MISC	this distinction between decision-making based on feelings and decision-making based on thorough deliberation is a prominent distinction in psychology and decision-making research  citation
MISC	most american respondents give  irrational   magical responses in a variety of situations that exemplify the sympathetic magical laws of similarity and contagion
MISC	in most of these cases  respondents are aware that their responses usually rejections  as of fudge crafted to look like dog feces  or a food touched by a sterilized  dead cockroach are not  scientifically  justified  but they are willing to avow them
OWNX	we interpret this  in some sense  as  heart over head
MISC	sympathetic  magical  thinking is recognizably irrational to most educated adults who show the effects
MISC	participants often laugh at themselves or almost apologize in face-to-face studies in which they acknowledge reluctance to engage in activities such as eating a piece of chocolate that is shaped to look like dog feces  drinking apple juice from a brand new bed pan  wearing a sweater that had been previously worn by someone with aids after it was sterilized by heat  or drinking a glass of juice that had previously been touched to a dead  sterilized cockroach
MISC	the two relevant laws are contagion  once in contact  always in contact  and similarity  like causes like   and  appearance equals reality 
MISC	if two entities are associated  and one has negative properties  then the second may take on some of these properties  citation
MISC	for example  an object owned by but never touched by a disliked person  may take on negative properties
MISC	consider a person who feels bad about wearing a new sweater that has the words  convicted murderer  written on the label inside the neck rim
MISC	although embarrassment would be thought to work against such admissions  participants seem to sense that in this peculiar domain they have license to display their feelings
MISC	participants observed as sugar from a commercial package was poured into two clean bottles
MISC	they were then given two labels  one saying  sugar  and the other saying  sodium cyanide  poison   and asked to place one label on each bottle  as they chose
MISC	most participants subsequently showed more reluctance to drink sugar water made from the bottle that they had labeled with the cyanide or even a  not sodium cyanide  label
OWNX	we suspect that this willingness to show a rather silly  if genuine response  would be curbed if the stakes were higher  that is  for example  if money were at stake
MISC	one might be willing to acknowledge a silly magical feeling  but not to put money behind it
OWNX	identical magical scenarios are described  and respondents indicate  in a between-subject design  their feelings or willingness to pay to avoid interaction with a magically degraded object
OWNX	we also include a data set in which the same respondents make both types of judgments  at different periods of time  two months apart
MISC	in markets with asymmetric information  only sellers have knowledge about the quality of goods
MISC	sellers may of course make a declaration of the quality  but unless there are sanctions imposed on false declarations or reputations are at stake  such declarations are tantamount to cheap talk
OWNX	moreover  we find in this experimental market that deceptive sellers offer lower prices than honest sellers  which could possibly be explained by the same wish to limit the damage to the other party
OWNX	however  when the recipient of the offer is a social tie we find no evidence for lower prices of deceptive offers  which seems to indicate that the rationale for the lower price in deceptive offers to strangers is in fact profit-seeking by making the deal more attractive rather than moral
MISC	a market is said to have asymmetric information if only the sellers know the quality of goods
MISC	experimental studies support this basic argument  citation
MISC	the core features of the traditional market-for-lemons model are quality and prices of goods
MISC	high quality goods are assumed to be more valuable to sellers and buyers alike  but only sellers know the quality at the time of sale
MISC	in order for any deception to take place  sellers must also be able to make a quality declaration  true or false
MISC	if no reputation-building or other sanctions are possible  such declarations are considered cheap talk and are usually discarded as irrelevant in game theory  citation
MISC	the archetypical example of a market-for-lemons is the market for used cars
MISC	however  uri gneezy  citation  points out an empirical departure from the theoretical prediction        he then suggests that buyers often place sufficient trust in private sellers' honesty because many private sellers actually prefer to be honest
MISC	indeed  many experimental studies have found that most subjects usually do not take advantage of a possibility to deceive another party  citation
MISC	these studies also identify several moderators of the decision whether to deceive  in particular  gneezy  citation  found that deception is less likely to occur the more it damages the other party
OWNX	we will think of this as a moral cost of deception
OWNX	here we present a novel experimental study of deception and price in a market for lemons
OWNX	our first aim is to establish that also in this context  most subjects will tend to be honest
OWNX	said differently  we expect most subjects who advertise a  peach  will actually sell a peach and not a lemon
OWNX	our second and main aim is to study the relationship between deception and pricing
MISC	in a market where the sellers set the prices  no gain is made from deception unless the seller actually charges more for the good when the buyer believes it to be of high quality
MISC	this pricing aspect has no counterpart in gneezy's study  where subjects only chose whether to be honest or to deceive
OWNX	in our experiment   gadget  sellers compete for buyers both with declared quality and price
MISC	at first glance  it may seem unreasonable for honest and deceptive sellers to deviate in the price they offer  since the gadgets are indistinguishable to the buyers at the time of purchase
OWNX	however  as we will discuss immediately below  there are several reasons why deceptive sellers might charge less
MISC	in the terminology of wolinsky  citation  higher price  signals  higher quality
OWNX	hence  our second question is whether sellers in our market employ price signaling
MISC	why would deceptive sellers charge less
MISC	following gneezy  liars that are concerned with the damage their deception causes buyers might want to compensate by offering a lower price  let us call this mechanism moral price signaling
MISC	an alternative mechanism is rational price signaling  profit-maximizing sellers who believe that most buyers prefer to buy lower-priced goods would actually charge less when deceptive than when honest
MISC	it is difficult to distinguish between these two mechanisms within the same market framework
OWNX	our approach is to let sellers make offers both to strangers and to friends
MISC	the rationale for this comes from research in sociology and social psychology showing that information asymmetries lead to strong preferences for socially embedded transactions on the part of buyers since friends are more trusted to behave honestly  citation
MISC	consequently  rational price signaling would not be expected between friends whereas moral price signaling would  if anything  be more accentuated between friends
OWNX	the cross-national experiment outlined in the section to follow was designed to answer these questions
OWNX	we collected data on sellers as well as buyers
MISC	these latter data allow us to investigate buyers' preferences over prices and social embeddedness
OWNX	in particular we want to ascertain that buyers tend to prefer lower priced offers unless the offer is from a friend
MISC	it has been proposed that recognition can form the basis of simple but ecologically rational decision strategies citation
MISC	borges  goldstein  ortmann  and gigerenzer citation found that constructing share portfolios based on simple name recognition alone often yielded better returns than the market index
OWNX	we find no support for the claim that a simple strategy of name recognition can be used as a general strategy to select stocks that yield better-than-average returns
MISC	however  there was some suggestion in the data that recognition performs better when the market is falling and worse when it is rising
MISC	we conclude that  with respect to changes in value  selecting stocks on the basis of name recognition is a near-random method of portfolio construction that offers little  if any  benefit to the personal investor
MISC	can quick-and-dirty decisions reasonably be expected to result in satisfactory outcomes  or do complex problems demand complex strategies
MISC	one of the simplest choice or inference strategies imaginable is the recognition heuristic
MISC	quite simply   if one of two objects is recognized and the other is not  then infer that the recognized object has the higher value   citation
MISC	when the rate or frequency of exposure correlates positively with value  the heuristic will lead to choice or inference accuracy above chance levels  citation
MISC	recent analysis by schooler and hertwig  citation  shows that the effectiveness of recognition may even be enhanced by forgettingeven though this leads to a failure to recognize some previously seen objects
MISC	if remembered objects are more likely to be associated with the relevant characteristics of the environment than forgotten ones  this will enhance the predictive or inferential power of recognition
MISC	here the recognition heuristic demands that   when choosing a set of objects from a larger set  choose the subset of recognized objects   citation
MISC	why might people use such a heuristic
MISC	first  in some situations  they may consciously accept the logic expressed in the previous paragraph
MISC	it probably makes sense to many people that the consumer products  movies  sports teams  and sports personalities that they have heard of are more successful than those they have notand they will be happy to make inferences accordingly
MISC	there are occasions when failure generates notoriety  ford's edsell car  the movie flop waterworld  the  number  jamaican bobsleigh team  or  eddie the eagle  whose olympic ski-jumping preparation lacked only a ski-jump
MISC	nonetheless  generally speaking  people know that it is success that breeds the personal exposure or column inches that will encourage recognition
MISC	alternatively  there may be other occasions when  in the absence of deliberative reasoning about recognition  more intuitive processes may drive recognition-based choices
MISC	people reliably prefer familiar stimuli  citation more so when they fail to recognise previously presented stimuli at better than chance levels and are presumably not conscious of prior exposure  citation
MISC	bornstein  citation  suggests that a preference for the familiar may be adaptive  as unfamiliar stimuli and situations have greater potential for risk than familiar ones do
MISC	although not necessarily easy to distinguish empirically  such accounts are conceptually distinct from the recognition heuristicstimuli may be more or less familiar  fluent or available  but are simply recognised or not recognised
MISC	nonetheless  recognised stimuli are inevitably more familiar and more available than unrecognised ones  and possibly  on average  more fluent too  citation
MISC	these features could explain why recognition-based choice may occur  even when the conditions that make it an effective strategy in certain circumstances are unknown or absent
MISC	the use of the recognition heuristic has been the subject of several empirical investigations
MISC	gigerenzer and goldstein  citation  reported that this heuristic helped people to make correct inferences when faced with the task of assessing which of two foreign cities had the greater population
MISC	assessing such geographical objects is associated with stable characteristics  the true answer has rarely changed in living memory  and will usually not change for many years to come  citation
MISC	for example  the correct answer to the question  which city is larger  colchester or stockholm
MISC	  has been the same for centuries and is unlikely to be different in the foreseeable future
MISC	this contrasts with dynamic domains such as sports events  where the accuracy of inferences varies over time
MISC	for instance  tennis ace roger federer is likely  though not certain  to beat the lowly-ranked ezequiel krivulin
MISC	furthermore  there may eventually come a time when this highly recognized superstar will begin to lose on a regular basis to younger unknown players
MISC	nonetheless  it has been shown that recognition can  to some extent  predict the outcome of sports events  citation
MISC	this task is also associated with variable characteristics  and so provides a tough test for the recognition heuristic
MISC	borges et al citation  found name recognition to be a surprisingly successful basis for stock investment
MISC	lay people and business graduates in the usa and germany indicated which company names they recognized among the largest companies listed on the new york and frankfurt stock exchanges
MISC	portfolios of shares consisting of the most frequently recognized shares outperformed portfolios consisting of shares recognized by fewer than  number  percent  of participants over a six-month period beginning december  number 
MISC	these portfolios of frequently recognised shares outperformed the market index in six of eight possible comparisons treating recognition data from the four pools of participants across each of the two stock markets as distinct comparisons
MISC	only for americans' recognition of u s stocks did recognition-based investment under-perform the market index
MISC	this was symptomatic of a general trend in which the advantage for highly recognised stocks was greatest when people were apparently most ignoranti e   using the recognition data for foreign stock markets where recognition rates were  unsurprisingly  lower than for domestic stocks
MISC	that such a simple strategy should prove to be effective was surprisingand therefore grabbed attention among the financial press as it runs counter to the efficient market hypothesis  which anticipates that the index cannot consistently be beaten by simple investment strategies
MISC	borges et al citation  provide some speculation on the reasons for their results  for instance the possibility that features such as market share  company size and prestige may all be associated with both recognition and profitability  and that limited recognition best exploits the ability of the recognition heuristic to discriminate profitable and unprofitable shares
MISC	put simply  the suggestion is that company success and other features that foster recognition also tend to drive up share value
MISC	hence recognized shares will yield higher average returns than unrecognized ones
MISC	if an individual recognizes few shares  they probably only recognize the elite companies whose size and success has made them household names with good prospects for share return
MISC	however  an important question is whether such a mechanism could be sustainable in a market
MISC	boyd failed to replicate borges et al 's  citation  results in a falling  bear  market with a sample of american students providing recognition data on us stocks
MISC	both boyd  citation  and borges et al citation  discuss the possibility that recognition may not be a good strategy in such markets when  big  firms are often observed to perform poorly
MISC	merton's  citation  model of capital market equilibrium predicts that attempts to replicate borges et al 's  citation  finding are more likely to fail than to succeed
MISC	merton  citation  points out that investors can acquire only those shares that they recognize
MISC	consequently  demand and value will tend to be higher for company shares that are widely recognized
MISC	however  merton's theory predicts that investment returns will correlate negatively with recognitionmore highly recognized firms will yield lower returns  implying that the recognition heuristic should under-perform the market index
MISC	this is consistent with the  neglected firms effect  whereby the shares of firms with narrow investor bases outperform more widely held shares  citation
MISC	the effect persists even when company size is controlled  and may be interpreted as an informational effect
MISC	for obvious reasons  investors need information in order to predict future profits  dividends  and stock returns
MISC	the less information investors have  the greater the chance that important information that predicts extreme changes in value is missing
MISC	therefore  in order to invest in unfamiliar companies  investors require a risk premium on their investment  which roughly corresponds to their increased effort in searching for information about those companies
MISC	in contrast  the market will sustain share returns from well-known companies that are more modest  as investors feel that they have  or can obtain  sufficient information on these shares to be able to guard against the risk of severe losses
MISC	several studies have examined factors that ought to affect recognition  citation  such as analyst coverage  advertising expenditure or exchange listing
MISC	many of these have found an effect upon security value consistent with merton  citation
MISC	for instance  barber and odean  citation  showed that private investors tended to purchase  high-profile  stocks that had previously experienced high volumes or returns  or had been in recent news reports
MISC	this strategy was shown to under-perform the market index
MISC	weber  siebenmorgen and weber  citation  provide some insight into why investors might follow an unprofitable investment strategy driven by the  attention-grabbing  features of shares
MISC	they found that people tend to perceive shares that they recognize as less risky than those that they fail to recognize
MISC	more direct tests of merton's  theory have tended to focus on breadth of ownership among institutions with holdings in excess of   number  million as a proxy for recognition
MISC	however  lehavy and sloan  citation  showed that changes in the breadth of ownership do indeed positively predict current share value and negatively predict future returns when autocorrelations for value or return over time are controlled
MISC	lehavy and sloan  citation  and others who have examined breadth of ownership recognize its limitations as a proxy for recognition
MISC	whilst it is plausible that increases in recognition will often result in increases in the breadth of ownership  it is illogical that decreases in the breadth of ownership might imply that some investors no longer recognize a particular company that they previously knew of
MISC	thus share recognition is considered at the level of the individual potential investor  rather than at the level of the large corporate investor
OWNX	we use these data to re-examine whether simple recognition alone can form the basis of a viable investment strategy
MISC	in particular  two questions that relate to how well borges et al 's  citation  findings generalize are considered
MISC	firstly  were their results simply a function of random variation in prices or applicable only to a particular period of time
OWNX	to this end our studies commence at different time points  and we track share value over differing periods of time
MISC	readers will see that  despite being at the mercy of the markets  this allowed us to test the effectiveness of the recognition heuristic in markets that fell and rose to differing degreespermitting a detailed re-evaluation of borges et al 's  citation  and boyd's  citation  findings under a variety of conditions
MISC	secondly  are borges et al 's findings restricted only to particular combinations of populations of participants and stock markets
MISC	thus  can one say that  recognition is an ecologically valid strategy for stock selection  or simply that  recognition data from germans and americans selects better than average german stocks
MISC	this permits us to test the recognition heuristic over a range of recognition rates typically high for domestic or  home  shares  and low for overseas or  away  shares
MISC	examination of many such participant-market combinations is important in order to determine whether there might be any general effect that favours or penalizes recognized over unrecognized shares
MISC	although borges et al citation  report eight comparisons between portfolios of recognized and unrecognized shares  these are not independent comparisons
MISC	for instance  there was some overlap in which shares are always recognized by laypeople and business graduates from a given country  citation
MISC	note that we are not interested in whether personal or professional investors actually use the recognition heuristicsimply in whether  if they did  it would be effective
MISC	open-ended methods that elicit willingness-to-pay wtp in terms of absolute dollars often result in high rates of questionable and highly skewed responses  insensitivity to changes in health state  and raise an ethical issue related to its association with personal income
MISC	wtp as a percentage of financial resources generated fewer questionable values  had better distribution properties  greater sensitivity to severity of health states  and was not associated with income
MISC	many economists elicit people's willingness to pay wtp for healthcare interventions through contingent valuation surveys so that the benefits of those interventions can be valued in monetary terms  citation
MISC	this is despite many known biases that occur when attempting to elicit a dollar value from people for a good that is not usually directly available in the market  e g   perfect health  citation
MISC	much literature focuses on developing consensus on the most valid method for eliciting wtp  putting aside any philosophical issues that question the validity of eliciting wtp through a single elicitation
MISC	early wtp surveys elicited values using an open-ended question from a self-interest perspective to obtain personal use values  e g  how much would you be willing to pay to be cured
MISC	    citation
OWNX	these open-ended formats ask for wtp values without presenting a starting point value and without using a search routine to help respondents determine a value
MISC	however  researchers have questioned the validity of this format because responses are prone to a high number of non-response or zero values and because responses are heavily skewed toward high values  perhaps  in part  due to strategic bias  citation
MISC	in response to these concerns  a u s federal panel in  number   led by kenneth arrow  concluded that  both experience and logic suggest that responses to open-ended questions will be erratic and biased   citation
MISC	since then  researchers have moved away from eliciting wtp using an open-ended format and developed three types of closed-ended formats in an attempt to overcome shortcomings of the open-ended format
MISC	these  close-ended  formats ask respondents to say yes or no to a series of questions or to select a value from a pre-specified list
MISC	all three methods have methodological issues  however
MISC	the single-bounded discrete choice format is statistically inefficient and studies using this approach are very expensive to conduct because  all else being equal  it requires a larger sample size and more sophisticated design and analysis techniques  citation
MISC	in addition  this format is prone to several biases including  yea-saying  where respondents have a tendency to agree with the amount presented  citation
MISC	a double-bounded choice format was derived to increase statistical efficiency
MISC	however  even responses from people who report a high level of certainty about their willingness to pay exhibit significant anomalies that increase as uncertainty increases  citation
OWNX	we believe the open-ended format deserves further exploration
MISC	although different formats produce different responses  it is not clear which format is superior  citation
MISC	a recent study comparing alternate elicitation formats concluded   
MISC	it would seem that the most informative elicitation format in the present context
MISC	appear s  to be the open-ended format
MISC	 though this  format is nowadays distinctly unfashionable in health economics  having long since given way to supposedly-superior elicitation formats   citation
MISC	advantages of the open-ended format are that it does not introduce range or starting-point biases and it can be highly statistically efficient compared to discrete choice formats
MISC	the open-ended format also has several clear disadvantages  however
MISC	this format may place a heavy cognitive demand on respondents
MISC	in fact  the other formats were developed  in part  to make the elicitation simpler and more realistic for respondents  citation
MISC	furthermore  asking for wtp in terms of dollars using an open-ended format requires using an unbounded response scale a scale that starts at zero but with no defined upper end that naturally contributes to the highly variable and skewed responses typically seen with open-ended wtp elicitations  citation
MISC	in addition  people may be more likely to give  strategic  values with an unbounded scale  a respondent may believe that the treatment has high intrinsic or social value and thus places a very high value not grounded in the reality of actually paying such a figure in the form of taxes or as an out-of-pocket expense  citation
MISC	conversely  a respondent may give an artificially low response in an attempt to influence the actual price eventually charged
MISC	it could be that a more constrained  but still essentially open-ended approach might avoid some of the problems reviewed above
MISC	specifically  eliciting wtp as a percentage of financial resources has two potential advantages
MISC	first  a percentage measure will force the use of a bounded  numbernumber  response scale creating a more statistically efficient scale measure  citation
MISC	generally  people are unable to map their preference for a health effect using a scale consisting of dollars with that starts at zero but with no clear maximum amount an unbounded scale  citation
MISC	second  percentages involve smaller numbers a  numbernumber  scale for the percentage formats versus  number  to an undefined maximum for the dollar formats and people process smaller whole numbers more reliably
MISC	in one study  thompson  read  and liang  citation  found that a percentage measure exhibited more significant associations with key independent variables such as the number of symptoms suffered by respondents and medications taken than did wtp expressed in dollars
OWNX	we predicted that the percentage method would be less prone to inconsistent responses  would be more sensitive to differences in severity across health states  and would show more desirable distributional properties
MISC	we asked for percentages based on  financial resources  rather than income because it is realistic to expect that many people would consider savings  borrowing power  and other financial resources to pay for a cure of a condition they want to avoid
MISC	thinking about paying out amounts on a monthly basis rather than a single lump sum enables respondents to think of smaller quantities and the amounts proposed are likely to be more salient because many people budget their finances on a monthly basis
MISC	advantages of the percentage format could be reduced or eliminated when monthly payments rather than lump sum payments are considered
MISC	the current study extends the studies done by thompson and colleagues the largest study  to date  that has elicited wtp as a percentage in several ways
OWNX	first  we introduce a within-subjects measure of sensitivity
OWNX	second we compare the effects of using a monthly timeframe to elicit wtp to a single lump-sum amount
OWNX	third  we focus specifically on distributional properties of responses to further assess percentage formats as a more efficient measure
MISC	finally  the current study utilizes a larger sample  and surveys the general public instead of patients
OWNX	we study individual decision making in a lottery-choice task performed by three different populations  gamblers under psychological treatment    number  ddicts   gamblers' spouses  victims   and people who are neither gamblers or gamblers' spouses  normals 
MISC	the large majority of victims report themselves unwilling to take any risk at all
MISC	however  addicts in the first year of treatment react more than other addicts to the different values of the risk-return parameter
MISC	since the late  number s  individual decision making under risk has been one of the most popular issues studied by economists and psychologists
MISC	on the other hand  empirical contributions from both disciplines have adopted a variety of methodologies
MISC	the most salient and intriguing result across all these different methodologies is that decisions in a risky environment are very sensitive to the framing of the choice task and to some individual characteristics
MISC	since  citation   pathological gambling has been included in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published by the american psychiatric association  number 
MISC	patients with spectrum-related disorders show an intense desire to perform a specific behavior preceded by unpleasant feelings and physiological activation  all of which are relieved when the behavior is performed  citation
MISC	thus  several authors consider pathological gambling pg as an obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder  citation
MISC	moreover  compulsive behaviors include increased evasive behavior  anticipatory anxiety and risk aversion  which are not usually observed in the behavior of pathological gamblers pgs
MISC	this lack of agreement among experts on whether gambling is an egosyntonic or egodystonic disorder could even imply that gamblers may be heterogeneous with respect to their attitudes towards their addiction
MISC	therefore  at a first stage  whether gambling is an egosyntonic or egodystonic disorder would influence the way pgs feel about their condition
MISC	at a second stage  this could interfere with the degree to which they feel more attracted than normal subjects by bets involving riskier options
MISC	therefore  studying whether pgs behave differently from normal subjects in risky decision-making tasks would require isolating the first level of pleasure or discomfort due to being a gambler from the second level of pleasure due to betting on riskier options
MISC	a natural way of obtaining a more homogeneous population of gamblers with respect to their attitude towards their addiction is isolating and studying a population of egodystonic gamblers as are those who have voluntarily decided to quit and participate in a gambler anonymous ga therapy group
MISC	several aspects of pgs' behavior have been studied so far
MISC	such studies are either aimed at shedding light on specific methodological issues that should be accounted for when studying decision making by pgs or are directly addressing the question whether pgs suffer form some kind of cognitive bias
MISC	among different kinds of cognitive bias  the most obvious suspect is probability distortion due to attraction to risky bets  which could yield irrational behavior reflected on higher degrees of risk taking as compared to normal subjects
MISC	along this line are the studies by toneatto   citation   gaboury and ladouceur citation  and  especially  leopard  citation   while goodie  citation  adopts a slightly different approach to higher levels of risk taking showing that they are the result of overconfidence
MISC	we want to know whether the decisions of the aforementioned groups in an abstract lottery-choice task significantly differ from those taken by  normal  subjects and  if so  in what way
MISC	in order to address this question   number  subjects played a hypothetical version of the lottery-choice task introduced by sabater  and  georgantz   number  s   citation  and further developed and discussed in georgantz   number  s et al citation
MISC	first  it can be used to distinguish between risk-averse and risk-neutral risk-loving subjects
MISC	it also measures an individual's degree of risk aversion
MISC	second  the task captures a subject's reaction to different risk premia
OWNX	our sample consists of three different subsamples
MISC	the second subsample  labeled  victims  consists of  number  spouses of subjects from the first subsample
OWNX	the third subsample consists of  number  subjects which are our control population  labeled  normals
MISC	sabater  and  georgantz   number  s  citation  and georgantz   number  s et al citation  provide us with a much larger data set obtained with normal student-subjects faced with the same task under different payment methods
MISC	interestingly  victims are even more risk-averse
OWNX	in section  number   we further discuss our objectives and hypothesis
OWNX	in section  number   we explain the experimental design
OWNX	section  number  summarizes the results and section  number  contains the conclusions
MISC	the appendix presents an english translation of the instructions
MISC	five experiments addressed a controversy in the probability judgment literature that centers on the efficacy of framing probabilities as frequencies
MISC	the natural frequency view predicts that frequency formats attenuate errors  while the nested-sets view predicts that highlighting the set-subset structure of the problem reduces error  regardless of problem format
MISC	previous studies reporting that frequency formats reduced conjunction errors confounded reference class with problem format
MISC	after controlling this confound  the present study's findings show that conjunction errors can be reduced using either a probability or a frequency format  that frequency effects depend upon the presence of a reference class  and that frequency formats do not promote better statistical reasoning than probability formats
MISC	there is evidence for a frequency advantage in bayesian reasoning  citation   overcoming the overconfidence bias  citation   and in reducing conjunction errors in extensional reasoning  citation
MISC	although specific explanations for the frequency effect vary by task  the general conclusion reached by proponents of the natural frequency perspective is that presenting frequencies promotes intuitive statistical reasoning because such formats are compatible with an evolutionary-based computational algorithm  citation
MISC	alternative explanations  as well as contradictory evidence  for the frequency effect have been offered  citation
MISC	in particular  the nested-sets hypothesis  citation  suggests that frequency effects may be an indirect consequence of inducing a set-inclusion problem representation  which contributes to making the problem's logical structure transparent  and thus easily solvable
MISC	according to the nested-sets hypothesis  presenting information in a way that allows people to extract subsets relative to supersets in the problem structure is the key to facilitating reasoning
MISC	such facilitation can occur whether or not information is presented as frequencies or as probabilities  so long as the critical set-subset structure is made salient
MISC	for example  sloman et al citation  tested three versions of a medical diagnosis problem first posed by casscells  schoenberger  and grayboys  citation
MISC	the probability version of the problem was stated as follows a frequency version of the problem  adapted from cosmides  and  tooby  citation  was stated as follows the third problem version was a nest-sets probability version that highlighted the set-subset structure of the problem
MISC	what is different between problem versions  however  is that both the frequency version and the nest-sets probability version highlight the set-subset structure among the critical categories of those who test positive whether or not they have the disease  number   number   and those who test positive and have the disease  number   number 
MISC	the nested-sets hypothesis predicts that both the frequency version and the nested-sets probability version will facilitate correct responding because both versions make the set-subset relationships among the critical categories transparent
MISC	sloman et al 's  citation  findings support the nested-sets hypothesis
MISC	they found that the probability version resulted in significantly fewer correct answers than did either the frequency version or the nested-sets probability version
MISC	the latter two problem versions did not significantly differ in the number of correct solutions they elicited
MISC	evans et al citation  ran a similar study but included a  frequency hard  condition in which the false positive rate of  number  percent  was stated as  number   number  instead of  number   number   thus obscuring the problem's nested-sets structure
MISC	in further support of the nested-sets hypothesis  evans et al citation  found that both the probability and the frequency hard problem versions resulted in significantly fewer correct responses than did the frequency version that highlighted the set-subset structure by stating the false positive rate as  number   number 
MISC	perhaps the strongest evidence in favor of the nested-sets hypothesis is provided by yamagishi  citation   who presented a bayesian reasoning problem in frequency and probability formats  crossed with the presence or absence of a diagrammatical representation of problem structure a roulette wheel whose areas reflect the relative proportion of hits  misses  and false positives
MISC	he found that  in the absence of the diagram  there was a frequency effect
MISC	in the presence of the diagram  however  there was no significant difference in proportion of correct responses between frequency and probability problem formats
MISC	such evidence suggests that bayesian reasoning is facilitated by proper problem representation  and that frequency formats offer no additional advantage when the problem structure of the task is clarified
MISC	aside from bayesian reasoning  almost no research examining the nested-sets hypothesis has been conducted on other judgment biases in which frequency effects have also been reported
MISC	it is theoretically meaningful to extend the growing evidence favoring the nested-sets hypothesis to tasks that reveal failures of extensional reasoning  such as the conjunction fallacy  citation
MISC	to date  only two published accounts have examined frequency effects in the classic linda problem  citation   and only one study provided a direct test of the nested-sets hypothesis for that problem  citation
MISC	both fiedler  citation  and hertwig and gigerenzer  citation  reported that frequency formats led to fewer proportions of participants committing conjunction errors in comparison to probability formats
MISC	there was a potential confound in those studies  however
MISC	a reference class was given in the frequency version of the problem that was absent in the probability version
MISC	it is unclear from those studies whether the reduction in conjunction errors is the direct result of manipulating problem format or the result of presenting information in a manner that facilitates problem representation
MISC	to illustrate  consider the two versions of the linda problem presented by fiedler  citation
MISC	both versions presented the following information in the probability format  participants were asked to rank order a list of  number  statements about linda according to their probability
MISC	among the statements were two constituent categories  linda is a bank teller   linda is active in the feminist movement  and their conjunction  linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement 
MISC	the probability format asks for ranks and does not provide a reference class for the judgment
MISC	a similar confound existed in the studies reported by hertwig  and  gigerenzer  citation
MISC	the confound between response mode numeric estimate vs rank and reference class present vs absent prohibits a clear interpretation of the findings
MISC	indeed  hertwig and chase  citation  reported that significantly more conjunction errors are committed in a ranking probability response mode than in a numeric probability estimation response mode
MISC	the frequency effect found in both the fiedler  citation  and the hertwig  and  gigerenzer  citation  studies could be the result of confounding response mode with problem format  citation
MISC	the facilitating effect of a frequency format could also be a secondary consequence of providing participants with a reference class and focusing their attention on sub-categories within that class  rather than be a direct result of framing the problem as a frequency judgment
MISC	sloman et al citation  reported finding no significant differences between frequency and probability formats in the linda problem when the set-inclusion relationships between critical categories were made opaque by separating constituent categories from their conjunction with seven  filler  statements
MISC	their finding suggests that  when the set-subset structure of the problem is obscured  the frequency effect disappears
MISC	the finding is consistent with the nested-sets hypothesis
MISC	economic games involving allocation of resources have been a useful tool for the study of decision making for both psychologists and economists
MISC	in two experiments involving a repeated-trials game over twenty opportunities  undergraduates made choices to distribute resources between themselves and an unseen  passive other either optimally for themselves but non-competitively  equally but non-optimally  or least optimally but competitively
MISC	surprisingly  whether participants were told that the anonymous other was another student or a computer did not matter
MISC	using such terms as  game  and  player  in the course of the session was associated with an increased frequency of competitive behavior
MISC	males were more optimal than females  a gender-by-incentive interaction was found in the first experiment
MISC	in agreement with prior research  participants whose resources were backed by monetary incentive acted the most optimally
MISC	overall  equality was the modal strategy employed  although it is clear that motivational context affects the allocation of resources
MISC	imagine being repeatedly given the choice between receiving   number  and   number 
MISC	the obvious choice is to take the   number  every time
MISC	now imagine that this choice comes with the following strings attached  if you select the   number  for yourself  then an anonymous other will receive   number   but if you take the   number   that anonymous other will instead receive   number 
MISC	   to this person  it was well worth it to sacrifice a couple of dollars to ensure having a relative advantage over the stranger
OWNX	another stated that she would take the unusual path of alternating between the options from trial to trial   i'd get   number  and then   number   while he'd get   number  and then   number   so we'd both end up with the same amount  number  eachafter every other trial
MISC	   this person had calculated that while such a strategy would not yield maximal amounts for either party  it would reduce any discrepancy in earnings between them
MISC	a third noted that his decisions may differ depending on how the situation was framed
MISC	popular economic games examine how participants allocate resources
MISC	for example  two commonly studied games are the ultimatum game  citation  and the dictator game  citation
MISC	in the ug one student proposes a distribution of resources for example  if   number     number  for him and   number  for the other player
OWNX	if the other player accepts  the   number      number  split becomes reality
OWNX	if he rejects the offer neither gets anything no negotiation is possible
OWNX	in the dg whatever the proposing participant proposes becomes reality the second  player  is passive
MISC	it is also instructive to ask participants to choose between two possible fixed allocations of resources between themselves and another player  citation
MISC	half the participants are told that the other player is a person and half that the other player is a computer
MISC	according to the  computers are social actors  or  casa  model  citation   the social rules applying to human-human interaction apply equally to human-computer interaction  implying that participants in the sharing game might treat computer players the same way as  human  players
MISC	in no way does the recipient act upon the allocator in either game
MISC	in contrast  the participants and computers in the casa experiments always performed some sort of two-way interaction with each other  whether the participants were told that the computer was running a program or was acting as the medium through which another person was communicating
MISC	for half the participants the points earned have monetary value  for the others they do not
MISC	this manipulation assesses a question  sometimes contentious between economists and psychologists  of whether comparable results can be obtained with and without monetary incentive  citation
MISC	messick and mcclintock  citation  previously found there to be no significant difference between these two display conditions  but their results involved a game in which both participants had equal decision-making power
MISC	although van lange  de bruin  otten  and joireman  citation  assert that people generally exhibit stable preference patterns  de dreu and mccusker  citation  and fantino and colleagues have argued that contextual variables can and do affect persons' behavior in choice situations  citation
MISC	the present study asks whether the distribution of the sharing game strategies is affected by the economic context in which the game is played
MISC	a corollary of this question concerns the extent to which the strategies are relatively stable as they might be if reflective of fundamental personality characteristics
MISC	theories of inequality aversion  citation  state that in economic situations  people tend to act to minimize the difference between their own and others' payoffs
MISC	these theories would predict sharing game allocators to choose so as to reduce or eliminate the difference between players' totals which can be ideally accomplished by alternating between the payoff choices in each pair of trials
MISC	on the other hand  charness and rabin's  citation  theory of reciprocal fairness would predict that players would consistently choose the optimal option so as to maximize social welfare
MISC	the issue of whether or not financial incentives affect decisions in economic games has been discussed extensively
MISC	hertwig and ortmann  citation  noted that the use of real financial incentives as opposed to hypothetical financial incentives often distinguished between the research of economists and psychologists  respectively   economists generally pay participants on the basis of clearly defined performance criteria  psychologists usually pay a flat fee or grant a fixed amount of course credit   citation
MISC	subsequently  stolarz-fantino  fantino  zizzo  and wen  citation  found no effect of immediate financial incentives on performance in a conjunction fallacy task
MISC	camerer and hogarth  citation  report that performance in certain types of economic game experiments is helped by financial incentives while performance in other types of economic games are not
MISC	the sharing game bears a similarity to the dictator game in that one participant is the sole decision maker with respect to how resources are to be allocated
MISC	in their survey of dictator game experiments that used hypothetical and varying amounts of real money as reinforcers  camerer and hogarth  citation  reported that       if our sharing game participants have a similar goal of wishing to appear generous  then we can expect them to behave competitively less often when points are not backed by real money
MISC	in addition  hertwig and ortmann  citation  call for  learning more about the specific conditions under which payoffs improve  do not matter to  or impair task performance
MISC	   from a theoretical perspective it appears important to further clarify the conditions under which financial incentives affect performance  as hertwig and ortmann  citation  have argued
MISC	it is also important from a pragmatic standpoint   if certain studies of economic games produce the same results with hypothetical and real incentives  then a great deal of human participant money may be saved
MISC	the sharing game task used in the present experiments shares a characteristic with the popular prisoner's dilemma game  citation  in that both games constrain the choices of participants and present them with conflicting options
MISC	in that regard the sharing game differs from the popular ug and dg in that on any given choice the participant must choose between getting more for oneself and still more for the other participant or less for oneself and still less for the other participant
MISC	choices on the ug and particularly the dg are relatively unconstrained
MISC	the sharing game forces the participant to choose between an outcome that is optimal for both participants and one that is competitive giving a relative  but non-optimal advantage to the allocator
MISC	an equitable choice is absent
MISC	however  the trials are arranged so that it is possible for the participants to respond equitably over trials
MISC	thus  as mentioned above  participants behaving according to inequality aversion theories  citation  may be expected to alternate choices  thereby maintaining equal payoffs for both participants
MISC	the possible effects of other variables such as monetary incentive and whether the other participant is a person or computer should enable us to determine the extent to which these distributions of choices are stable or are influenced by these variables
MISC	would participants allocate resources optimally in this task by always selecting the larger payoff for themselves and the other player
MISC	if not  how would the frequency of non-optimal choices choosing the smaller payoff be affected by each of the three variables nature of other player  monetary incentive  and display of the other player's cumulative score
MISC	would participants who do not consistently choose optimally consistently choose the  competitive  outcome lower payoffs  with the participant receiving the larger share
MISC	or would they equalize the payoffs for the two players
MISC	when offered a choice between two lotteries  individuals consistently choose the lottery with the greater number of potential successes  even when it offers a smaller probability of success
OWNX	in the current study  we conduct experiments to confirm this phenomenon and test for the existence of bias as distinct from general irrationality
OWNX	we confirm the existence of the bias
MISC	moreover  the existence of an incentive significantly reduces the extent of irrationality exhibited  and that this effect is roughly linear in response to changes in the size of the incentive within the magnitudes investigated
MISC	consider the following problem  you are asked to draw a red marble from either of two urns
MISC	urn b contains  number  marbles   number  of which are red
MISC	which urn do you choose
MISC	a rational actor maximizing the probability of choosing a red marble will choose urn a
MISC	psychologist seymour epstein and colleagues  citation  have documented that many individuals choose urn b when presented with this choice or similar choices
MISC	epstein named this the ratio-bias phenomenon  as it appears that individuals are biased toward choices with large numbers of potential successes  rather than large probabilities of potential successes
OWNX	first  we test for errors within this framework in a symmetric fashion
MISC	referring to the example above  we not only present participants with decisions like that one  but also with decisions in which the urn with the larger number of marbles has the greater probability of success and is therefore the optimal choice
MISC	the second dimension of interest is that of incentives
MISC	the participant in a ratio-bias experiment confronts a decision that is well suited to the introduction of a small monetary incentive and the testing of its marginal effect
MISC	modern conceptions of the skill component include control citation and competence citation
MISC	the control hypothesis states that a task's skill component the sensitivity of the task to skill affects decision making  the competence hypothesis states decision making is affected only if the participant possesses the skill
MISC	one group faced bets on random events  and another group faced bets on their answers to general knowledge questions  which is a task characterized by control
MISC	in experiment  number   control increased risk taking markedly with all statistical properties held constant
MISC	in experiment  number   decisions made in domains of varying difficulty  and by individuals of varying ability  yielded further qualified support for the role of competence
MISC	decision researchers know a great deal about the terms of risk that people will accept and reject on random events such as the drawing of a lottery number  rolling a die  or pulling a poker chip from a bookbag
MISC	less is known about how individuals accept or reject risk when they are betting on their own golf putts  stock picks  organizational decisions or answers to trivia questions
MISC	researchers readily build models of decision making around risky decisions based on random events
MISC	much decision research is analogous to psychophysical perception research  relating psychological events to objective criteria
MISC	a bookbag with  number  percent white and  number  percent red poker chips presents a clear objective criterion to which subjective perceptions may readily be compared
MISC	sinking a free throw does not present such a clear criterion with regard to its associated probabilities
MISC	ellsberg  citation  and many others have found that people are generally ambiguity averse  in the domain of gains  people prefer a prospect in which probabilities of possible outcomes are known to a prospect in which probabilities of the same outcomes are not stated ambiguous but have the same average value
MISC	the major exception to this is at very low probabilities  where ambiguity is preferred
MISC	in the domain of losses  these preferences are reversed
MISC	examination of the effect of a skill element constitutes a special case of ambiguity
MISC	what is shaquille o'neal's probability of making his next free throw
MISC	at his next free throw opportunity  he may be suffering from the flu  or coming off a terrible game  or on a hot streak  or he may merely believe he's on a hot streak  citation
MISC	in other words  the prediction of performance is variable over time in a skilled task  hence it is more difficult to predict on the basis of past performance
MISC	in fact  most definitions of skill state or imply that the person exerting skill can change the probability of success
MISC	the existing evidence suggests that a skilled task that determines an uncertain outcome has an effect on probability assessment and decision making that is distinct from that of ambiguity alone
MISC	for example  in demonstrating the illusion of control  langer  citation  showed that people responded differently to vague likelihoods when certain superficial characteristics of the prospects were distorted  for example when the familiar symbols of a deck of cards were replaced by unfamiliar symbols  or when participants were permitted to practice on a random mechanism similar to a roulette wheel
MISC	langer argued that the changes in the appearance of a skill component caused changes in responses
MISC	confidence ratings  bet acceptance and bet amounts were all affected by apparent control  although the illusion of control is not robust to multi-shot gambles  citation
MISC	participants bet more when given skill-relevant manipulations such as being able to choose whether to receive more cards in a simulated blackjack game  but not when given skill-irrelevant manipulations such as choosing a different dealer  citation
MISC	also  participants high in desire for control bet more than those low in desire for control on events over which they had falsely perceived control
MISC	those high in desire for control bet less than others on events over which they did not have illusory control  citation
MISC	recent research has advanced two major conceptions of the role of skill in decision making  competence  citation  and control  citation
MISC	these conceptions have important commonalities  sharing an emphasis on the role that the skill component of a task plays in shaping decision making under uncertainty apart from the probability and magnitude of possible outcomes
MISC	the control hypothesis claims that people bet more when skill makes a difference  the competence hypothesis claims the same effect but only when an individual possesses the relevant skill
MISC	control is a property of the task  if the task requires actions that can be learned  then it is characterized by control  even if a participant has not yet learned the skill
MISC	competence  on the other hand  is an interactive characteristic of both the task and the person  competence exists only if the task both can be learned the task component and has been learned the person component
MISC	heath and tversky  citation  argued that people prefer to bet on questions about knowledge topics in which they feel competent rather than incompetent
MISC	in their studies  participants chose to bet on either the correctness of their answer to a general knowledge question or a random event whose probability matched their previously stated confidence  with identical payoffs in each bet offer
MISC	across an assortment of situations  when betting on questions drawn from intermixed domains  the proportion of times that participants chose to bet on their knowledge was a steeply increasing function of the probability of winning experiments  number  and  number 
MISC	because confidence consistently exceeded accuracy in these experiments  betting on a random event whose probability of winning was equal to confidence was more likely to win than betting on the belief itself  and heath and tversky  citation  noted that the acceptance of knowledge-based bets over random bets resulted in a  number  percent  loss of expected earnings
MISC	heath and tversky then experiment  number  tested the competence hypothesis by drawing questions from discrete domains in which participants believed themselves to be either competent or incompetent
MISC	they observed that  with subjective probability held constant  participants displayed a consistent behavioral pattern  bets in a domain of competence were preferred to bets on random events  which in turn were preferred to bets in a domain of incompetence
MISC	they concluded that people seek out ambiguity in domains of competence but avoid it in areas of incompetence
MISC	fox and tversky  citation  presented a companion to the competence hypothesis  the comparative ignorance hypothesis  positing that relative knowledge affects decisions most strongly when the contrast between conditions of greater and lesser competence is brought to the decision maker's attention
MISC	more recent studies  citation  assessed risk attitude by pitting a bet on knowledge item against no bet at all  rather than a bet on a random event of equivalent probability
MISC	goodie constructed bets on knowledge items to be fair  having zero average marginal value if confidence was well calibrated
MISC	in the first two experiments  bet acceptance sharply increased as confidence increased for knowledge bets  bearing a striking resemblance to the comparable data obtained by heath and tversky  citation  when using mixed-domain questions
MISC	in experiment  number   one group considered bets on their knowledge
MISC	the other groups considered bets on events that appeared random to participants but that goodie constructed to be identical in every statistical way to bets on knowledge
MISC	participants accepted more bets on random events at low probabilities and more bets on their knowledge at high probabilities  revealing the anticipated crossover effect
MISC	an important difference arises between studies that utilize questions drawn from a single domain e g   u s history and those that use questions from mixed domains e g   greek mythology  u s history  and sports
MISC	as heath and tversky  citation  noted in discussing the differences between single and mixed domains  low confidence items in mixed-domain populations will systematically include more questions from low-competence domains
MISC	similarly  gigerenzer  citation  noted the importance of utilizing single-domain questions in assessing confidence in answers
MISC	in a mixed-domain set of general knowledge questions  the methods used by the decision maker to generate confidence assessments become uninterpretable because the decision maker may be using a different reference set than the experimenter
MISC	asking participants questions in a single domain allows for more reliable representations of confidence across all questions asked
MISC	there is reason to expect that control per se influences decision making
MISC	skinner  citation   in a major review of the literature  notes that   w hen people perceive that they have a high degree of control  they exert effort  try hard  initiate action  and persist in the face of failures and setbacks  they evince interest  optimism  sustained attention  problem solving  and an action orientation   citation
MISC	where control prevails  a prospect with negative expected value  narrowly conceived  might also be an opportunity to learn new skill that will result in future prospects with positive value  and might therefore be worth accepting
MISC	the possibility of accepting bets in order to increase skill does not apply when competence already exists  only when the possibility of exerting control to increase competence prevails
MISC	the present experiments test the competence hypothesis against the control hypothesis by eliciting betting decisions within domains of varying difficulty and among participants of varying ability
MISC	the distinction between competence and control is most evident in a skill-based task in which a particular participant has little skill
MISC	the control hypothesis suggests people bet more when skill could be attained  the competence hypothesis only when it has been attained
OWNX	we report three experiments which use the methods developed by goodie  citation
MISC	the first question type was a two-alternative forced choice question
MISC	prior studies  citation  adapted questions from a collection  citation  that sampled from diverse domains
OWNX	three question populations selected two of the  number  u s states at random and asked for a binary comparison on one statistic  population  land area  or population density  manipulated between-subjects
MISC	the second question type asked for an assessment of confidence in each question  placed in one of the following categories   numbernumber  percent    numbernumber  percent    numbernumber  percent    numbernumber  percent    numbernumber  percent    numbernumber  percent   and  numbernumber  percent 
OWNX	we used these categories to assess risk taking across a well-defined array of probabilities from chance to certainty  combining equal spacing of categories in the mid-range and greater discrimination near the endpoints
MISC	this range confers the advantages of reflecting all binary choices and being simple and easily understood  although it also bears the clear limitations of excluding half the probability spectrum
MISC	these studies adopted confidence elicitation methods without alteration from those used by goodie  citation
MISC	a third question type elicited acceptance or rejection of a bet on the correctness of each answer that was given
MISC	participants played out these bets for point accumulations that were not backed by monetary incentives
MISC	in all conditions  participants faced a two-alternative choice between a certain outcome and a bet
MISC	the bet was always fair  having average value equal to the certain option if the participant's confidence judgment was well-calibrated
MISC	its average value was less than that of the certain option if the participant was overconfident and greater than the certain option if the participant was underconfident
OWNX	we used two betting formats  with mixed gains and losses  and gains only
MISC	the gains only format was used to eliminate the complexity of possibly differing value and weighting for gains and losses
MISC	betting formats were always varied between subjects  or were kept constant within an experiment  so that no participant needed to comprehend  remember  or distinguish between both
MISC	in the mixed format  the certain option was no change in points  and the bet provided for a gain of  number  points if the answer was correct or a loss of  number    confidence  number -confidence points if the answer was incorrect
MISC	if she rejected the bet  she did not gain or lose any points
MISC	in the gains only structure  the certain option was a gain of  number  points
MISC	it is easy to show that the average outcome of accepting a bet in either format is equal to the certain option no change in the mixed format or a gain of  number  points in gains only if pcorrect   confidence  less than the certain option if pcorrect  confidence  and greater than the certain option if pcorrect  confidence
MISC	the answers group bet on their answers  using either the mixed or gains only format in different experiments
MISC	the random group's bets held all statistical properties constant  differing from the answers group's only in appearing to rely on random events rather than participants' answers
MISC	many dimensions of bets on knowledge are determined by the participants' responses  such as the distribution of subjective probabilities of winning determined by confidence  the frequency of winning determined by accuracy  and any order effects on these dimensions  citation
MISC	bets that appeared stochastic in fact relied on participants' answers and confidence assessments in the knowledge questions
MISC	the magic number this time is   number 
MISC	if the chosen number is less than or equal to the magic number  you gain  number  points
MISC	if the chosen number is greater than the magic number  you lose  number  points
OWNX	we prevented participants from participating in more than one of the present experiments or in any additional related experiments
MISC	participants ran in groups of up to three in a room with individual computer stations separated by five-foot-tall partitions
MISC	we omitted participants' data from analysis if they did not use more than three confidence categories  or if they showed evidence of not attending to the task i e   exclusive betting acceptance or rejection  or radical over- or underconfidence
MISC	thirty participants were excluded for this reason  number  out of  number  in experiment  number    number  out of  number  in experiment  number   and  number  out of  number  in experiment  number 
OWNX	see table  number  for a layout of the structure of our experimental design
MISC	the deliberation without attention dwa effect refers to apparent improvements in decision-making following a period of distraction
MISC	it has been presented as evidence for beneficial unconscious cognitive processes
OWNX	we identify two major concerns with this claim  first  as these demonstrations typically involve subjective preferences  the effects of distraction cannot be objectively assessed as beneficial  second  there is no direct evidence that the dwa manipulation promotes unconscious decision processes
MISC	decision theorists have long distinguished between analytical and intuitive decision making  citation   often attributing them with different processing modes  citation
MISC	despite the flourishing theoretical literature supporting this dichotomous view  the number of empirical attempts to contrast the effects of intuition and deliberation is limited
MISC	one reason for this lack of research is the difficulty of assessing the goodness of any particular decision  citation
MISC	another reason could originate from the traditional assumption that reasoning and analysis always lead to better outcomes  citation
MISC	nevertheless  some of the theories subscribing to this dichotomous view assume that under certain circumstances intuitive decisions can bring more optimal results than rational thinking
MISC	these results were often explained by the hypothesis that reasoning can lead people to use non-optimal criteria and consequently to make worse decisions  citation   or that intuitive decisions can benefit from the use of  smart heuristics   citation
MISC	according to unconscious thought theory  citation  intuitive decisions may benefit from unconscious thought  a high capacity process which can weight numerous pieces of information and integrate them into decisions automatically and via distributed  bottom-up processing
MISC	they argue that this  smart  unconscious process is more capable in complex  information-dense decision situations than conscious thought  which is limited by working memory capacity
MISC	empirical support for utt comes primarily from the deliberation-without-attention dwa paradigm  citation  in which participants are presented with a list of positive and negative attributes describing a variety of possible choices within a particular category e g   apartments
MISC	according to utt  the best choices will be made by participants in the unconscious thought condition  because the irrelevant task interval provides an opportunity for unconscious processing of information
MISC	as has been noted previously  citation   it is also possible that a forced delay between evaluation which may be completed early in the four minute interval and response in the conscious thought condition may somehow e g   by self-generated interference reduce performance  the immediate decision condition acts as a baseline  providing control for this counterintuitive effect of forced delay
MISC	initial studies using this paradigm provided many illustrations of this  dwa effect   supporting for utt  citation
MISC	however  several recent papers have challenged this interpretation and questioned the degree of support the original paradigm offers for utt
MISC	a series of studies has reported a failure to replicate the original results  citation
MISC	others have found that the effect may only occur under specific circumstances  citation
MISC	acker  citation  used a meta-analysis to determine that the benefit for choices following unconscious thought in the first  number  studies published was modest mean effect size g     number 
MISC	a more recent meta-analysis of  number  studies strick et al   n d reported a similar effect size g    number   which the authors propose as evidence for important moderators of the effect in the different designs of the task
MISC	overprecision is the most robust type of overconfidence
OWNX	we present a new method that significantly reduces this bias and offers insight into its underlying cause
MISC	in three experiments  overprecision was significantly reduced by forcing participants to consider all possible outcomes of an event
MISC	each participant was presented with the entire range of possible outcomes divided into intervals  and estimated each interval's likelihood of including the true answer
MISC	the superiority of this subjective probability interval estimate spies method is robust to range widths and interval grain sizes
MISC	its carryover effects are observed even in subsequent estimates made using the conventional   number  percent  confidence interval method  judges who first made spies judgments considered a broader range of values in subsequent conventional interval estimates as well
MISC	the federal home loan mortgage corporation  otherwise known as freddie mac  provides an online calculator on its website  to help potential clients determine whether they should buy a home or rent one
MISC	among the factors included in this calculation is the estimated appreciation value of the home in question  defined by the website as  the yearly percentage rate that an asset increases in value 
MISC	the user has to enter a percentage value by which  according to her best judgment  her potential home will increase or decrease
MISC	however  when a negative value i e   a forecast that the house's value will go down was entered  it was followed by an error message   please fix the following errors  appreciation rate must be a number between  number   number  and  number   number 
MISC	  the design of this online calculator conveyed freddie mac's belief that housing prices can change only between  number  percent  and   number  percent   with any rate outside this range being improbable
MISC	however  according to the federal housing finance agency  citation   the average yearly appreciation rate of houses in the united states was consistently outside this range from the second quarter of  number  through the first quarter of  number   falling as low as - number   number  percent  and even lower than - number  percent  in some states
MISC	this forecasting error  among others  resulted in freddie mac's near failure  before its take-over by the u s government in  number 
MISC	citation the failure of freddie mac to anticipate a depreciation of u s house prices is but one of many examples of overprecision in judgment
MISC	overprecision is a form of overconfidence  found to be both prevalent and particularly impervious to debiasing  citation
MISC	also referred to as overconfidence in interval estimates  citation   overprecision is the excessive certainty that one knows the truth
MISC	among its documented consequences are errors in clinical diagnosis  citation   excessive market trading  citation   and excessive conviction by individual climate scientists that they know the future trajectory of climate change  citation
MISC	overprecision is typically measured by eliciting a confidence interval - a range of values that the judge is confident  to a certain degree  will include the true value in question  citation
MISC	research has repeatedly found that the confidence people have in their beliefs exceeds their accuracy  meaning that the confidence intervals they produce are too narrow  citation
MISC	this pattern is observed in novice as well as expert judgments  citation
MISC	attempts to debias overprecision have had limited success
MISC	koriat  lichtenstein  and fischhoff  citation  argued that people's excessive confidence in their beliefs is driven by the more extensive search they conduct for supporting evidence than for evidence that contradicts their beliefs
MISC	however  when asked to consider evidence contradicting their answers before reporting their confidence  participants reported lower confidence levels
MISC	using this approach  soll and klayman were able to modestly reduce overprecision
MISC	other research has tried to reduce overconfidence by focusing on the format of the question  citation
MISC	this research found that interval evaluation  based on probability judgments of fixed intervals  produces less overconfidence than interval production
MISC	building on these findings  winman  hansson   and  juslin  citation  proposed the adaptive interval assessment adina method of eliciting judgments
MISC	an interval is produced around a specific value generated either by the judge  a peer  or at random  and the judge estimates the probability that this interval contains the correct answer
MISC	if this probability is higher than the desired confidence level  a narrower interval is presented next  and  similarly  if the initial probability is lower than the desired probability  then a wider interval is presented
MISC	this procedure is repeated until the probability assigned to the interval matches the desired confidence level
MISC	the authors found that the resulting intervals from this procedure displayed less overprecision than intervals that were produced directly
MISC	unfortunately  this reduction in overprecision appeared to be tied to the assessment format  subsequent assessments made with a different response format e g   confidence intervals reverted to their old  overly precise form  suggesting that the change in methods did not affect the cognitive process by which estimates were produced
MISC	shame leads to devaluation of the social self  and thus to a desire to improve self-esteem
MISC	the desire for money as reflected in overestimated coin sizes mediated the effect of shame on self-interested behavior
MISC	feelings of shame are often accompanied by a sense of shrinking or being small and by a sense of exposure in front of a real or imagined audience  citation
MISC	in current research  shame refers to a particular self-conscious emotion that is elicited when one's social self is threatened  citation
MISC	in line with the view of shame as a negative emotion  studies have so far mainly focused on tendencies to withdraw or to hide  citation
MISC	however  the feelings-as-information framework proposes that people with a negative affect tend to proactively adopt strategies to amend their negative mood  citation
MISC	frijda  kuipers  and ter schure  citation  found that shame was characterized by the tendency to disappear from view but also by the desire to undo the shame situation
MISC	these action tendencies are an important experiential component of emotions because they reflect the priority of mood-repair behavior that is motivated by the emotion  citation
MISC	the central focus of experiences of shame is a threatened or damaged self  citation
MISC	thus  a central motivation of shame will be to cope with this threat
MISC	consistent with the threatened egotism theory  citation   several psychologists have argued that people who feel shame are likely to seek positive feedback  or self-enhancement  to improve their self-esteem  citation
MISC	evolutionary psychology may also provide insight into money as an ego-protective function in relation to shame
MISC	shame is a human survival mechanism  citation
MISC	the evolutionary roots of shame may be grounded in the negotiation and evaluation of status in social dominance hierarchies  citation
MISC	social status determined whether a person could secure the resources necessary to survive  citation   thus  shame associated with a low social status would lead to the desire to increase money acquisition to ensure survival
MISC	moreover  money may help people express their competence and abilities  citation  and gain self-esteem and respect from others  citation
MISC	money and self-esteem partially compensate for one another when an option contains an abundance of one type of utility and lacks the other  citation
MISC	additionally  money produces a state of self-sufficiency  citation   which may buttress self-esteem
MISC	because money may not only serve as an entity for survival but also compensate for self-esteem  citation   it should possess a self-protective function with regard to shame
MISC	this second characteristic often leads to the disappearance of the framing effect in small group contexts comprising of  number  or  number  people
MISC	their results could shed new light on the effect of contextual group size on people's risk choice
OWNX	this study aims to examine the external validity of these results through different ways of experimentation and with a different sample base
MISC	over the last three decades  empirical research on human cognition and decision-making behavior has shown a systematic bias in a number of decision-making areas
MISC	one of the pioneering studies in this field was performed by kahneman and tversky on the effects of framing in life-death decision problems citation
MISC	a number of studies have been conducted to test the reliability and generalizability of tversky and kahneman's original study
MISC	on the one hand  with the standard cover story  strong framing effects have been replicated not only in different kinds of respondents  such as university faculty staff  students  and physicians citation but also in various applied areas citation
MISC	in support for the cognitive social line of inquiry  a series of studies by wang and colleagues observed an obvious effect of contextual group size on people's attitude to risk detailed in the next section
MISC	however this effect was usually detected in experiments with university students
MISC	thus  to examine the external validity of the contextual group size effect  it is worth verifying whether this effect can be replicated with a different method of experimentation with different sample types
OWNX	section  number  will explain wang's effect of contextual group size
OWNX	in section  number   we conclude with a summary and discussion of these results
MISC	binary sequences are characterized by various features
MISC	two of these characteristics-alternation rate and run length-have repeatedly been shown to influence judgments of randomness
MISC	the two characteristics  however  have usually been investigated separately  without controlling for the other feature
MISC	because the two features are correlated but not identical  it seems critical to analyze their unique impact  as well as their interaction  so as to understand more clearly what influences judgments of randomness
OWNX	to this end  two experiments on the perception of binary sequences orthogonally manipulated alternation rate and maximum run length i e   length of the longest run within the sequence
MISC	the effect of maximum run length was found to be small and less consistent
MISC	together  these findings extend prior randomness research by integrating literature from the realms of perception  categorization  and prediction  as well as by showing the unique and joint effects of alternation rate and maximum run length on judgments of randomness
MISC	in everyday life  individuals often encounter binary sequences of outcomes  such as tossing of coins  gains and losses in gambles  black and red outcomes on roulette wheels  birth orders in families  or ups and downs in the stock market  citation
MISC	whether such sequences are perceived as either random or lawful and patterned has important implications  both on the level of cognitive processes e g   categorizations  inferences and on the level of behavioral manifestations e g   following up on a  streak 
MISC	understanding how individuals form judgments of randomness is therefore critical
MISC	the present manuscript contributes to this goal by investigating the effects of two critical features of binary sequences-the length of the longest run and the alternation rate-on judgments of randomness
MISC	imagine a coin being tossed five times
MISC	first  the coin comes up heads
MISC	then  heads again
MISC	the same is true for the third  fourth  and fifth toss  resulting in a sequence of five heads hhhhh
MISC	most individuals who perceive this sequence would judge it as non-random  because they evaluate randomness not based on the generating mechanism-a coin toss-but on the resulting sequence of outcomes  such as hhhhh or hthth  citation
MISC	two characteristics of binary sequences of outcomes  alternation rate and run length  have repeatedly been identified as determining judgments of randomness
MISC	usually  however  these two characteristics have been investigated in separate lines of research  without controlling for the other
MISC	specifically  research on the perception and categorization of randomness primarily has focused on alternation rate  citation   while neglecting run length
MISC	in contrast  research on the prediction of randomness has primarily focused on run length  citation   while neglecting alternation rate
OWNX	here we offer evidence that the two characteristics may not only have unique effects  but that the effect of one may be contingent on the other
MISC	these efforts are potentially undermined  however  by variations in wording used by different researchers
MISC	the current study sought to determine whether  when  and how variations in wording influence moral judgments
MISC	online participants responded to  number  different moral vignettes e g   the trolley problem using  number  of  number  adjectives   wrong    inappropriate    forbidden   or  blameworthy 
MISC	for half of the sample  these adjectives were preceded by the adverb  morally 
MISC	results indicated that people were more apt to judge an act as wrong or inappropriate than forbidden or blameworthy  and that disgusting acts were rated as more acceptable when  morally  was included
MISC	although some wording differences emerged  effects sizes were small and suggest that studies of moral judgment with different wordings can legitimately be compared
MISC	more and more psychological and neuroscientific research on moral judgments appears each year
MISC	as fascinating results accumulate  the question arises of whether and how individual studies fit together to form a larger picture
MISC	in order to connect various studies and guide future work in this field  researchers need to determine which studies conflict  which support each other  and which are simply talking past each other
MISC	unfortunately  precise comparisons are hampered by the use of different moral terms across studies
MISC	different researchers ask whether acts are wrong  citation   forbidden versus permitted  citation   inappropriate  citation  or deserve blame  citation
MISC	some researchers include the adverb  morally  before these terms  citation   whereas others do not  citation
MISC	it is unclear whether judgments of what is morally wrong vary in response to the same factors as do judgments of what is forbidden  inappropriate  or blameworthy
MISC	some evidence comes from a meta-analysis on the asymmetry between  forbid  versus  allow  in attitudes research
MISC	this study demonstrated that people are reluctant to forbid but will readily not allow  even though these judgments are conceptually equivalent  citation
MISC	this asymmetry suggests that moral judgments  as well  may be influenced by subtle variations in wording
MISC	further evidence from cushman  citation  showed that harmless acts were judged as more wrong than blameworthy only when the act was intended and believed to cause harm
MISC	this finding also suggests that people  in some circumstances  will draw fine distinctions between moral terms
MISC	in addition  some wording effects on moral judgments would undermine the search for a moral faculty
MISC	some researchers suggest that moral judgments result from innate psychological mechanisms  or even a moral module that conforms to a universal moral grammar  citation
MISC	these theories and many more would be challenged if people judge acts in very different ways based on the moral terms used  because psychologically real mechanisms would be unlikely to vary markedly with such fine differences in wording within a particular natural language
MISC	conversely  if certain patterns of moral judgments are robust enough to persist through non-substantial variations in wording  it would help defend the assumption that these studies are investigating distinctive psychological mechanisms
MISC	hypotheses about decision processes are often formulated qualitatively and remain silent about the interplay of decision  memorial  and other cognitive processes
MISC	at the same time  existing decision models are specified at varying levels of detail  making it difficult to compare them
OWNX	we provide a methodological primer on how detailed cognitive architectures such as act-r allow remedying these problems
OWNX	additionally  to illustrate how such models can be tested  we conduct a model comparison  fitting the models to one experiment and letting them generalize to another
MISC	behavioral data are best accounted for by race models
MISC	one way to increase the precision of theories of decision making is to specify the cognitive processes decision-making mechanisms are assumed to draw on
MISC	corresponding process models predict not only what decision a person will make  but also how the information used to make the decision will be processed
MISC	the past decades have seen repeated calls to develop process models  and in fact  such models have become increasingly popular  citation
MISC	the predictions made by these models have motivated a number of debates  for example  whether people rely on noncompensatory  lexicographic as opposed to compensatory  weighted-additive processes in inference  choice  and estimation  citation
MISC	yet  often such process models are underspecified relative to the process data against which they can be tested
OWNX	in this article  we show how precision can be lent to process models by implementing them in a cognitive architecture
MISC	these models have been at the focus of a debate about what processes describe people's decisions best when they make inferences about unknown states of the world  such as when predicting which sports teams are likely to win a competition  which politician will win an election  or which cities are likely to grow fastest in the number of inhabitants
MISC	the current field study compares the time preferences of young adults of similar ages but in two very different environments  one more dangerous and uncertain than the other
MISC	soldiers  college students and a control group of teenagers answered questionnaires about their time preferences
MISC	during mandatory service  soldiers live in a violent atmosphere where they face great uncertainty about the near future and high risk of mortality measured by probability of survival
MISC	university students and teenagers live in much calmer environment and are tested for performance only periodically
OWNX	we suggest that the higher subjective discount rate among soldiers can be the result of high perceived risk in the army as an institution  or higher mortality risk
MISC	the subjective discount rate is the rate at which individuals trade current value for future outcome
MISC	this rate varies from person to person  depending on each one's willingness to wait
MISC	in general  an individual who values the present more than the future will have a higher subjective discount rate than a person who places more value on the future
AIMX	in the current paper  we examine how military service influences the time preference of soldiers
OWNX	we compare the time discount of soldiers in the israel defense forces idf to the time discount of university and high school students
MISC	since its establishment in  number   the state of israel has had universal conscription for all youths male and female upon completing high school at the age of  number 
MISC	by law  soldiers serve full-time for two females or three males years  and then continue serving in the reserves
MISC	their  employer  is a harsh and total institution-where all parts of life of the individuals under its authority are subordinate to and dependent upon the hierarchy of the organization-with very clear values
MISC	the soldiers are intensively trained and tested from the first day of basic training
MISC	conversely  university students in israel usually work and have higher earnings
MISC	they live in much calmer environment and are tested for performance only periodically
MISC	a few studies have tested soldiers' decision making and compare them to civilians
MISC	warner and pleeter  citation  studied the choices regarding early retirement plans of older soldiers in the us army
MISC	these soldiers were heterogenic in age  education  and earnings  and choose to join the army as a profession
MISC	in a recent article  haerem et al citation   compared educated  military decision makers to business students  and found that the soldiers exhibited high levels of self-efficacy that correlated with risk-seeking behavior
MISC	unlike other studies  our study is the first to test time preferences of young soldiers who did not join the army as a career choice but rather were drafted for mandatory service
OWNX	in order to ensure similar test conditions for the soldiers and other young adults  we distributed the questionnaires to both groups when they were travelling on the train
OWNX	section  number  presents the hypothesis
OWNX	section  number  describes the experimental design
OWNX	section  number  presents the results regarding the time preferences of soldiers and students
MISC	unfortunately most real world forecasts are not expressed clearly
MISC	this lack of clarity extends to both the description of the forecast event and to the use of vague language to express forecast certainty
MISC	it is thus difficult to assess the accuracy of most real world forecasts  and consequently the accuracy the methods used to generate real world forecasts
OWNX	to demonstrate applicability  the inferred probability method is applied to measure the accuracy of forecasts in fourteen documents examining complex political domains
MISC	in contrast to forecasting research  most published forecasts describe forecast events with considerable imprecision and use vague certainty expressions  citation
MISC	this is particularly true of forecasts about complex international political events  which is a substantive domain of interest to us
MISC	consider for example the statement from the stratfor forecasts for  number  for iran it's rather difficult to gauge what is meant by  fair chance 
MISC	if the event occurs  it would be unclear if it should be judged as a mostly accurate or inaccurate forecast
MISC	consider also the following statement from the stratfor iran  number  forecast in addition to the fact that different individuals vary widely in their interpretation of the word  likely   citation   the phrase  backing down  is itself hard to define
MISC	if there is a negotiated settlement does that mean that iran  backed down   that the other parties  backed down   or that a settlement was found where everyone could claim success
MISC	in such cases it is difficult to specify clear criteria a priori for determining whether or not the event occurred
MISC	they believe that clarity requirements severely limit their ability to express what they intend to say
MISC	for example  a phrase such as  backing down  succinctly describes an important element of a forecast event-namely that the individuals involved will be accepting an option that is less desirable than their expressed preference
MISC	though there may be valid reasons for expressing forecasts imprecisely there is still a need to evaluate forecast accuracy
MISC	research in expert political judgment  citation  would suggest that  lacking objective feedback on the accuracy of their forecasts  experts are unlikely to accurately determine when their forecasts were inaccurate
MISC	furthermore  without measuring the accuracy of real world forecasts it is difficult to compare the accuracy of different forecasting methods outside of artificial research settings-and unfortunately results from artificial research settings are widely ignored by practitioners
MISC	the distinction between academic research and practice is well illustrated by the fourteen years of research with political analysts summarized in tetlock  citation
OWNX	our objective is to add sufficient rigor to the evaluation of imprecise forecasts to enable the application of common metrics of forecast accuracy to forecasts that are actually published
OWNX	our approach incorporates two basic techniques  inferred probabilities and impartial ground truth judgments
OWNX	first we use inferred probabilities to impute quantitative probabilities from verbal expressions of certainty
OWNX	simply put  we ask multiple readers to assign quantitative probabilities based on their understanding of the written document  rather than their personal beliefs
OWNX	in addition  as needed  we use inter rater agreement data to statistically adjust estimated ground truth frequencies
OWNX	below we present the details of our current instantiation of the inferred probability method
MISC	difficulty making decisions is one of the symptoms of the depressive illness
MISC	previous research suggests that depressed individuals may make decisions that differ from those made by the non-depressed  and that they use sub-optimal decision-making strategies
MISC	these styles and estimates of decisional self-esteem were then related to depressive symptoms
MISC	depressive symptomatology correlated negatively with perception of self as a decision-maker
MISC	those with higher depression severity scores characterized themselves as being more anxious about decisions  and more likely to procrastinate
MISC	they also reported using fewer productive decision-making strategies  depending more on other people for help with decisions  and relying less on their own intuitions when making decisions
MISC	further research is needed to determine the extent to which these decision-making styles are antecedents to depressive symptomatology or are instead products of  or aspects of  the phenomenology associated with depression
MISC	like personality traits  these styles do not have perfect predictive power  but instead represent likelihoods of behavior across situations and domains
MISC	that is  a person scoring high on a particular decision-making style  such as spontaneity  when needing to make a decision can be expected to act in a spontaneous manner more often than in a thoughtful and deliberate one
MISC	the number of styles of decision-making is subject to debate
MISC	for instance  scott and bruce  citation  suggested that there are five decision styles  whereas harren  citation  and nygren  citation  identified three decision styles
MISC	decision styles were found to be associated with a variety of behaviors and attitudes  including life choices  such as career and health-related decisions  citation   consumer behavior  citation   evaluations of new technology  citation   and cultural backgrounds  citation
MISC	sadness - the emotion most closely associated with depression - has been shown to influence decisions made in both experimental tasks  citation  as well as real-life decisions  citation
MISC	individuals suffering from a variety of psychopathological conditions that influence the degree and the quality of affect  stress  or anxiety  are therefore likely to engage in decision-making that differs from that of better-adjusted individuals  which may result in less productive decisions  citation
MISC	thus  individuals with disorders such as depression may have a particular pattern of decision styles
MISC	an individual's most prominent decision-making style is one that reflects the default coping strategy employed when making important decisions
MISC	a questionnaire to assess both the confidence as a decision-maker as well as the coping strategies has been developed  citation   assessing for three styles of decision-making defensive avoidance  hypervigilance  and vigilance as well as the individuals' confidence as a decision-maker
MISC	a strong emotion or psychopathology may affect a decision process either through its effect on decisional self-esteem or by increasing the likelihood that a suboptimal decision coping style such as defensive avoidance or hypervigilance will be employed  rather than the more adaptive decision-making style  namely vigilance
MISC	indeed  avoidant decision style was found to be associated with greater perceived stress  citation
MISC	radford  nakane  ohta  mann  and kalucy  citation  used the mann  citation  questionnaire in a cross-cultural study comparing decision styles of japanese and australian depressed subjects and controls
MISC	australian depressed subjects exhibited lower self-esteem as decision makers compared to australian controls  whereas for japanese subjects there was no such difference
MISC	echoing the findings from their previous work examining decision-making in inpatients with psychiatric disturbances  citation   australian depressed subjects found decision-making very stressful  and were more likely than non-depressed to use maladaptive decision styles  interestingly  few differences were found between depressed and nondepressed japanese subjects
MISC	as in the radford et al citation  study  depressive symptoms correlated with poor self-esteem as a decision-maker  careless decision style  and avoidance of decisions
MISC	many important decisions that will affect later adult life  such as willingness to persevere in school  interest in potential occupations  and choice of peers  are made during the adolescent years
MISC	the association of maladaptive decision styles with adolescent dysphoria  citation  highlights the need for earlier identification of the potential problem  which would then allow for earlier  targeted interventions
MISC	other evidence suggesting that depressed individuals may have a distinct pattern of decision-making comes from research in areas related to decision-making
MISC	indecisiveness has been noted as one of the core symptoms of depression  according to the dsm-iv-tr  citation
MISC	decisional avoidance  or a tendency to  avoid making a choice by postponing it or by seeking an easy way out that involves no action or change   citation  may be especially problematic for depressed individuals  citation
MISC	pietromonaco and rook  citation  compared the decision styles of dysphoric college students to those of controls by asking them to make decisions about real-life situations with a possible risk and a possible benefit
MISC	dysphoric students considered risks to be more likely  more important  and more damaging in all types of situations
MISC	for social situations  dysphorics also under-rated benefits  as compared to the non-dysphorics  and were more reluctant to proceed with a decision  which is consistent with findings that affective component of decision-making may produce an inverse correlation between perceived risks and benefits  citation
MISC	the pietromonaco and rook results suggest that dysphoric individuals may be more avoidant in decisions  and that it might be due to increased perception of risk  which makes them more cautious
MISC	depressed individuals may therefore exhibit greater indecisiveness  greater avoidance of decisions  as well as greater avoidance of risk
MISC	perfectionist tendencies  insofar as they contribute to feelings of disillusionment and dissatisfaction with oneself and with the world  have been shown to be associated with depression  citation
MISC	schwartz et al citation  found that individuals who tend to pursue the best possible option  rather than the  good enough  option  are more likely to have depressive symptoms
MISC	whereas  satisficers  are likely to be happy with the option that just satisfies their needs   maximizers  are considerably less likely to be fully satisfied with their choices  because the  perfect  option is usually a rather elusive goal
MISC	maximizers are also more prone to experience regret  which further contributes to dysphoria
MISC	regret has also been found to be associated with depressive symptoms  citation
MISC	it is therefore likely that decision-making styles based on perfectionism  and tendency towards regret would be associated with depressive symptoms
MISC	interestingly  a recent study found that maximizers may have a somewhat distinct decision style profile  specifically greater spontaneity in their decisions  citation
MISC	several questionnaires assessing decision styles have been developed  citation   each of which targets a relatively small set of decision styles
MISC	for instance  the analytical subscale from the nygren  citation  instrument is similar to the rational subscale from the scott  and  bruce  citation  questionnaire  and similar to the mann  citation  vigilance subscale
MISC	similarly  the defensive avoidance subscale  citation  has features similar to both avoidant and dependant subscales from the scott  and  bruce  citation  questionnaire
MISC	however  administering more than one questionnaire to study participants would be impractical given the aforementioned overlap
MISC	furthermore  current instruments do not address some styles of decision-making that are likely to be especially relevant for depressed individuals
MISC	as discussed above  risk-avoidance  perfectionism  and being prone to regret have not been included in decision style inventories
MISC	the new instrument sampled a broad set of decision-making styles and constructs that are related to decision-making
MISC	in study  number   the resulting instrument was used to identify patterns of decision-making that are common to depression by relating decision-making styles to the assessment of depressive symptoms
MISC	environmental events such as natural disasters may influence the public's affective reactions and decisions
OWNX	shortly after the  number  tsunami disaster we assessed how affect elicited by thinking about this disaster influenced risk perceptions and future time perspective in swedish undergraduates not directly affected by the disaster
MISC	an experimental manipulation was used to increase the salience of affect associated with the disaster
OWNX	in study  number  we found that participants reminded about the tsunami had a sense that their life was more finite and included fewer opportunities than participants in the control condition not reminded about the tsunami
OWNX	in study  number  we found similar effects for risk perceptions
MISC	in the face of a major environmental event  many people tend to react with emotion and emotion-laden decisions  citation
MISC	the  number  east asian tsunami disaster had a profound psychological impact on many countries  not only those that were directly hit by the tsunami waves
MISC	sweden pop  number  million had an unusually high number of tourists visiting the area at the time of the disaster  resulting in over six hundred swedes being killed or missing
MISC	the tsunami disaster was therefore considered a major national tragedy in sweden  citation
MISC	a consequence of this tragedy  and the media attention it received  citation   was that many swedes felt deeply involved and saddened  citation
MISC	the feelings elicited by such an event may also have an impact on everyday decisions
MISC	previous research in judgment and decision making has shown that preferences are constructed on the basis of various contextual factors  citation  and people tend to rely on their affective reactions when making decisions  citation
MISC	affect is defined here as the specific quality of goodness or badness experienced as a feeling state with or without awareness and demarcating a positive or negative quality of a stimulus
MISC	most previous research on affect and decision making has focused on integral affect  citation
MISC	however  in many judgments other sources of affect are also present
MISC	a large number of studies shows that affective states that are unrelated to the judgmental target influence judgments and decisions nonetheless  citation
MISC	in a famous example  johnson and tversky  citation  found that incidental affect i e   a mood state induced by reading a newspaper article influenced subsequent risk judgments
MISC	however  the effect of incidental affect on judgments is not a stable  unchangeable or unavoidable fact  it should rather be seen as a constructive process where the individual tries to determine if their affective reactions to a target are a reliable and relevant source of information  citation
MISC	at the core of this argument lies the notion that when asked to make an evaluative judgment  individuals seek information to determine how they should make this judgment
MISC	people tend to use whatever information is available to them at the time of making a decision  citation
MISC	in the absence of other relevant or more salient information  people use their affective reactions to the target to evaluate the object  citation
MISC	people in positive moods tend to evaluate objects more favorably than participants in a negative mood  citation
MISC	one important point here is that people incorrectly attribute their incidental moods as a reaction to the target
MISC	this misattribution can be corrected or changed by introducing information that questions the diagnostic value of the affective reaction for the judgment
MISC	for instance  in schwarz and clore's  citation  study participants were given a simple reminder about the cause sunny vs cloudy weather of their moods which resulted in mood no longer influencing judgments of well-being
MISC	importantly though  it was the diagnostic value of the affective reaction for the judgment task  not the affective reaction itself  that was affected by this manipulation  citation
MISC	incidental mood is only one of many sources of experiential information that can be used in judgments
MISC	the meta-cognitive experience of the ease or fluency of information processing has been shown to be an important experiential factor informing judgments and decisions  citation
MISC	in a study on the effect of fluency on decision making  participants were more likely to defer choice when they generated more reasons for making the choice  citation
MISC	studies on perceptual fluency the subjective ease of perceptual processing have found that if the color in which a statement is printed makes it easy to read  this can impact the perceived truthfulness of the statement  citation
OWNX	previous research has documented the effects of laboratory-induced mood using standardized mood induction procedures autobiographical recall or affect-inducing scenarios
OWNX	our research strategy compared ratings of affect and ratings of future personal and societal events in two groups of participants  one reminded about the tsunami and a control group
OWNX	we hypothesized that reminding participants about the tsunami would elicit negative affect associated with the event
MISC	in study  number   participants in both conditions completed a measure of future pessimism future time perspective ftp scale  lang  and  carstensen   number  and rated their well-being  citation
MISC	the ftp scale was originally developed as an individual difference measure of the perceived time remaining in life  citation
MISC	in study  number   half of the participants in the tsunami-remind condition were given an additional experimental manipulation  citation
MISC	participants then made risk estimates of various future positive and negative events  citation
MISC	conflict over iran's nuclear program  which involves a us-led policy to impose sanctions on iran  is perceived by each side as a preeminent challenge to its own national security and global peace
MISC	yet  there is little scientific study or understanding of how material incentives and disincentives  such as economic sanctions  psychologically affect the targeted population and potentially influence behaviour
OWNX	we integrate experiments within a survey of  number  iranians
OWNX	we find that a relatively small but politically significant portion of the iranian population believes that acquiring nuclear energy has become a sacred value  in the sense that proposed economic incentives and disincentives result in a  backfire effect  in which offers of material rewards or punishment lead to increased anger and greater disapproval
MISC	this pattern was specific to nuclear energy and did not hold for acquiring nuclear weapons
MISC	the present study is the first demonstration of the backfire effect for material disincentives as well as incentives  and on an issue whose apparent sacred nature is recent rather than longstanding
MISC	in dealing with political conflict  two broadly different approaches to modeling the values that drive decisions and choice of behavior are the consequentialist approach  based on instrumental or material values  citation   and the deontological approach  based on moral or sacred values  citation
MISC	the consequentialist approach suggests that all decisions are ultimately based on the expected outcomes of actions
MISC	there are serious misgivings about the explanatory adequacy of theories of rational choice in economics  citation  and politics  citation
MISC	recent work in social and cognitive psychology suggests that sacred values may be critically involved in important decisions in life  citation   as well as in sustaining seemingly intractable cultural and political conflicts  citation
MISC	sacred values svs appear to be intimately bound up with sentiments of personal and collective identity  citation   may have privileged links to emotions  citation   show insensitivity to quantity and calculations of loss versus gain  citation  and resist material tradeoffs  citation
MISC	a psychological implication is that holders of sacred values are strongly averse to using traditional utility-based models to reason about these values
MISC	fierce inter-group conflicts may also arise over issues with a much narrower history  such as iran's national nuclear program  which is perceived as a major source of challange to security by each side
MISC	the nuclear program has been repeatedly depicted by the iranian leadership as an uncompromisable  citation   and  inalienable    citation  right
MISC	the white house recently acknowledged the possibility that iran's  ideological commitment to nuclear weapons is such that they're not making a simple cost-benefit analysis on this issue   citation
MISC	a preliminary experiment  citation  suggested operation of svs for iran's nuclear program  however  the sample was small  and  most importantly  the study was ambiguous about whether the svs were about acquiring nuclear energy or nuclear weapons
AIMX	in the current paper we investigate how feedback over decision outcomes may affect future decisions
MISC	this effect is not only observed when this feedback evoked regret with counterfactual outcomes being higher than factual outcomes  but even when the feedback evoked no regret with factual outcomes being equal to counterfactual outcomes
MISC	the findings suggest that this effect on subsequent decisions is at least partly due to the transfer of a comparison mind-set triggered in the prior choice
MISC	regret is a negative experience that most of us would want to avoid
MISC	it stems from comparing an obtained decision outcome to outcomes that might have been had one chosen differently  citation
MISC	although the literature on regret distinguishes between experienced regret and anticipated regret  it does acknowledge a connection between the two in the sense that the experience of current regret may affect the anticipation of future regret  citation
MISC	in agreement with this notion  creyer and ross  citation  found that experienced regret on a bidding subsequently led to more risk averse biddings
MISC	more specifically  it led people to subsequently prefer high probability  low payoff options over low probability  high payoff options
MISC	also  in the context of consumer decision making  cooke et al citation  showed that experienced regret over a first decision influenced subsequent purchase decisions
MISC	in a similar vein  zeelenberg and pieters  citation  showed that experienced regret led consumers to switch to a different product
MISC	in these studies  the effect of experienced regret on subsequent decisions was domain-specific  in the sense that for example regret on purchasing a specific product was found to affect subsequent purchases of the same or similar product
MISC	more recently  however  raeva  mittone  and schwarzbach  citation  found that the effects of experienced regret might be broader in scope and even extend to decisions in other domains
MISC	in their study  regret over a risky decision affected subsequent decisions in an intertemporal choice setting
MISC	after playing a gamble  participants who learned that they could have obtained higher outcomes had they decided differently i e   had they played another gamble showed a stronger time preference  citation
MISC	time preference does not refer to a comparison between factual and counterfactual outcomes  and it is not related to the traditional gamble paradigm  and thus pertains to a different domain than the one in which participants experienced regret
OWNX	so how should we explain these findings
MISC	for the domain-specific effects of experienced regret on subsequent choice  the most straightforward explanation would be that after the experience of regret  decision-makers merely learn that they should not repeat their mistake  and thus change their behavior i e    once bitten  twice shy 
MISC	this would be consistent with most models of emotion regulation  citation  and more specifically regret regulation  citation
MISC	for the broader effects of experienced regret  however  such an explanation in terms of learning may not suffice
MISC	after all  after experiencing regret in a risky setting  it does not directly follow that one can avoid making the same  mistake  by showing a strong time preference
MISC	note  however  that even for the non-domain specific effects of regret one could envisage a carry-over process by assuming that it is not the specific decision-related regret that carries over to subsequent decisions  but rather that it is a more unspecified nature of regret that carries over
MISC	that is  the experience of regret may sensitize decision makers to future experiences of regret  and increase their motivation to avoid anticipated regret
MISC	rather than concluding that they do not want to make the same mistake twice  decision makers may reason that they do not want to experience the same negative emotion twice
MISC	it is this explanation that was favored by raeva et al citation
MISC	one of the defining characteristics of regret is that it is an emotion that it results from comparing  what is  to  what could have been 
MISC	when the obtained outcomes what is after making a choice compare unfavorable to the outcomes one could have obtained  decision-makers will experience regret
MISC	the comparing of decision outcomes is therefore essential to the experience of regret  if you don't compare  you don't regret  citation
MISC	xu and wyer  citation  recently demonstrated such a carry-over effect in a series of studies on purchase decisions
MISC	for example  in one of their experiments  they presented participants with an opportunity to buy one out of four types of products chocolate bars  potato chips  chewing gum  and pens
MISC	consistent with their comparative mind-set idea  participants' willingness to purchase one of these products increased if previously they had completed a task requiring them to compare animals to each other e g   comparing elephants to hippos
MISC	in other words  the evoked comparative mind-set in the animals task carried over to the product purchase task
OWNX	to investigate this possibility  we designed an experiment in which participants made two successive decisions
OWNX	subsequently  we presented them with a different task a matching task in which they had to match two options in terms of attractiveness
MISC	to induce regret on the first task  participants were presented with a situation in which they obtained low outcomes and learned that they would have obtained higher outcomes had they chosen differently
OWNX	to investigate the idea that-at least part of-the effects of this induction of regret may be attributed to the invoked comparative mind-set  we also included several alternative inductions
MISC	in these conditions  participants thus obtained low outcomes but could not compare their outcomes to what could have been
MISC	in the absence of a comparison of decision outcomes  people could therefore not regret their decision
MISC	this is consistent with bell  citation   who argued that  key to the identification of regret as a factor in decision making under uncertainty is the hypothesis that it may matter whether a foregone lottery is resolved or not
OWNX	this is the predicted phenomenon on which experimentation should be concentrated
MISC	  indeed  studies followed up on this advice and found that decision makers are most likely to anticipate regret when expecting feedback  citation
MISC	note that this condition is crucial  because in this condition too  participants would experience no regret  but this no-regret would now be the result of a similar comparison process  in this case  the conclusion that there is nothing to regret also results from a comparison of  what is  with  what could have been
MISC	it first examines its generality  analysing whether the kind of question being asked has an effect on the size of potential gains
MISC	previous results reporting potential accuracy gains are reproduced for year-estimation questions  and extended to questions about percentage shares
MISC	on the other hand  no gains are found for general numerical questions
MISC	an effective strategy to answer such questions is to make an estimate and average it with that of a second judge  a friend  a colleague or just about anybody else  citation
MISC	what  though  if your colleague or friend is unavailable and cannot give you that second opinion
MISC	the effectiveness of this suggestion  however  will depend on both the degree to which you are able to elicit two independent estimates from yourself and your willingness to average them
MISC	previous research has focused on the method used to elicit the second estimate
MISC	the focus here lies on the type of question being asked  and its interaction with how successive estimates are generated
OWNX	i report experimental results for different sets of questions which aim to be more representative of quantitative judgments  citation
MISC	   citation
MISC	while i find similar gains for questions about percentage shares e g    which percentage of spanish homes have access to the internet
MISC	   i do not find evidence of accuracy gains for general numerical questions such as  what is the distance in kilometers between barcelona and the city of hamburg  in germany
MISC	  or  what is the average depth of the mediterranean sea
MISC	i then investigate whether this difference can be explained by the degree to which answers to the various question types are implicitly bounded  but this hypothesis is not supported by the data
MISC	larrick and soll  citation  argue that people often do not understand the properties and benefits of averaging procedures
MISC	often  judges settle for one of their first two judgments as the final answer instead or even extrapolate  providing a final answer that lies outside of the range spanned by their first two estimates
MISC	affective forecasting skills have important implications for decision making
MISC	however  recent research suggests that immune neglect-the tendency to overlook coping strategies that reduce future distress-may lead to affective forecasting problems
MISC	prior evidence for immune neglect has been indirect
MISC	more direct evidence and a deeper understanding of immune neglect are vital to informing the design of future decision-support interventions
MISC	in the current study  young adults n    number  supplied predicted  actual  and recollected reactions to an emotionally-evocative interpersonal event  valentine's day
MISC	supporting the immune neglect hypothesis  participants overlooked the powerful role of coping strategies when predicting their emotional reactions
MISC	immune neglect was greater for immediate emotional reactions than more enduring reactions
MISC	biases in emotional judgment can disrupt decision making
MISC	affective forecasting  citation  is a particular type of emotional judgment that involves predicting how future events will affect one's emotional state
MISC	affective forecasting can significantly influence a range of important life choices  citation   including decisions to seek diagnostic medical testing  citation   exercise  citation   get divorced  citation   or file for personal bankruptcy  citation
MISC	in an effort to elucidate potential biases in affective forecasting  recent studies have examined how well predicted emotional reactions correspond to actual emotional reactions to life events
MISC	this research shows that affective forecasting is prone to error  and people are often biased toward overpredicting the intensity and duration of emotional reactions to future events  citation
MISC	a key reason for biased affective forecasting may be that people overlook coping strategies that attenuate emotional reactions to events
MISC	this phenomenon has been labeled immune neglect-the tendency to overlook coping strategies and other aspects of the  psychological immune system  that can reduce future distress  citation
MISC	three studies have provided indirect evidence for immune neglect  but none of these studies directly assessed coping strategies used by participants in the course of managing distressing events
MISC	an initial study showed that people overlook subtle aspects of the situation-particularly its potential influence on coping-when making affective forecasts  citation
MISC	in that study  participants predicted how they would feel in the event that they received negative personality feedback  either from expert psychologists purportedly infallible source or a computer purportedly fallible source
MISC	the source of the personality feedback did not influence predicted emotional reactions  but powerfully influenced actual emotional reactions experienced in response to the personality feedback
MISC	that study provided preliminary support for the possibility that  when engaging in affective forecasting  people might overlook coping strategies  such as being able to rationalize information from a fallible source
MISC	a follow-up study examined affective forecasting for college football team losses  citation
MISC	in that study  dispositional coping styles were found to be significantly correlated with actual emotional reactions to football losses but were unrelated to predicted reactions  situation-specific coping strategies were not assessed
MISC	cognitive processes  such as working memory  were associated with better emotional functioning after the loss  but had no bearing on predicted reactions
MISC	in these studies  situational factors  dispositional coping styles  and cognitive processes were unrelated to predicted emotional reactions  however  they were related to actual emotional reactions  presumably through an implied-but-unmeasured influence on situation-specific coping strategies that buffered emotional reactions to distressing life events see figure  number 
MISC	the time is ripe for basic research directly testing the immune neglect hypothesis
MISC	recent reform initiatives by the national institutes of health  citation  and institute of medicine  citation  have called for an expanded emphasis on the emotional processes underlying decision making
MISC	research on decision-support interventions is already targeting immune neglect in an effort to facilitate decision-making processes  citation
MISC	arguably  decision-support interventions are most likely to be effective when they are informed by a foundation of sound empirical evidence  citation
MISC	direct evidence and a deeper understanding of immune neglect is essential for the development of future evidence-based interventions that will use findings on affective forecasting to improve decision making
MISC	past studies have documented situational influences  dispositional coping styles  and cognitive processes that are associated with actual emotional reactions to life events  but not predicted emotional reactions-leading to biased forecasts
MISC	these three factors are thought to influence actual emotional reactions through their effect on situation-specific coping strategies
MISC	no study to date has assessed situation-specific coping strategies  the presumed proximal mechanism underling forecasting problems  despite implications for decision making and public health
MISC	in order to examine immune neglect directly  the present study used quantitatively-coded qualitative data on coping strategies used by participants on the day of a stressful life event
MISC	coping strategies can be assessed reliably using qualitative data  citation
MISC	furthermore  situation-specific coping strategies may be more robust than indirect or dispositional measures of coping in predicting emotional response to discrete life events  citation   suggesting that past studies may actually underestimate immune neglect
MISC	the central hypothesis of the study was that coping strategies would be associated with actual emotional reactions to a stressful life event  but not predicted reactions  thereby demonstrating immune neglect as a source of bias in affective forecasting
OWNX	the study was also designed to identify moderators of immune neglect to expand our understanding of the phenomenon
MISC	foremost  the valence of the event-whether the event is pleasant or unpleasant-may influence immune neglect
MISC	thus  the role of immune neglect in pleasant life events warrants further consideration
MISC	second  immune neglect may vary across the time course of emotional reactions
MISC	emotional reactions in response to life events attenuate over time  and empirical evidence is mixed as to whether affective forecasting is more difficult for immediate or more enduring emotional reactions to events  citation
MISC	thus  the present study examined whether participants were more likely to overlook the immediate or more enduring effects of coping strategies upon their emotions
MISC	several studies have examined predicted  actual  and recollected emotional reactions to life events to determine whether people learn from experience to make emotional judgments more accurately see hoerger  chapman  epstein   and  duberstein  in press
MISC	findings have been mixed as to whether predicted and recollected reactions are similarly problematic  or recollected reactions are less vulnerable to bias
MISC	in identifying moderators of immune neglect  this research can determine situations where immune neglect is most relevant and potentially inform future interventions for improving affective forecasting skills
MISC	the current investigation builds on the prior work of my colleagues and i  examining affective forecasting for valentine's day of  number   citation  and  number  hoerger  quirk  chapman   and  duberstein  in press
OWNX	these studies  and those from other labs  citation   demonstrate that young adults are vulnerable to overpredicting the intensity of emotional reactions to events involving relationships  dating  and breakups
MISC	for example  young adults overestimate how happy they will feel in the event of having a date on valentine's day  and overestimate how unhappy they will feel if they do not have a date  citation
MISC	the current investigation involves primary analyses of existing qualitative data relevant to coping that was gathered during the second of these studies hoerger  quirk et al   in press
MISC	supplemental analyses also examined whether immune neglect varied as a function of the valence of the event a pleasant event for those with a date  and unpleasant for those without a date  timing valentine's day  the day after  and two days after  or the type of emotional judgment predicted ratings versus recollected ratings of emotional reactions to valentine's day
OWNX	we present the concordant-ranks cr strategy that decision makers use to quickly find an alternative that is proximate to an ideal alternative in a multi-attribute decision space
MISC	cr implies that decision makers prefer alternatives that exhibit concordant ranks between attribute values and attribute weights
OWNX	we show that  in situations where the alternatives are equal in multi-attribute utility mau  minimization of the weighted euclidean distance wed to an ideal alternative implies the choice of a cr alternative
MISC	in experiment  number   participants were presented with a cr alternative and a number of arbitrary alternatives
MISC	in both experiments  participants tended to choose the cr alternative
OWNX	the cr alternative was on average evaluated as more attractive than other alternatives
MISC	in addition  measures of wed  between given alternatives and the ideal alternative  by and large agreed with the preference order for choices and attractiveness evaluations of the different types of alternatives
MISC	these findings indicate that both choices and attractiveness evaluations are guided by proximity of alternatives to an ideal alternative
MISC	this is true for large investments such as the purchase of a car or a home  but also for everyday consumer choices such as deciding what to eat
MISC	in all these choice situations  there might be several alternatives that cannot easily be discarded
MISC	usually  decision makers find a promising alternative that serves as a candidate for the final choice  which may be checked more or less thoroughly and differentiated from other alternatives before making the final choice  citation
MISC	they look through car ads  or browse a website for homes for sale  and may quickly find a promising alternative
MISC	this ability to make quick choices helps the consumer to solve life puzzles because lack of time is a fundamental feature of the modern consumer society  citation
OWNX	this manifests itself by using a strategy that we call the concordant-ranks strategy cr
MISC	according to this strategy  decision makers choose the alternative for which there is a concordance between the rank-order of the attribute values and importance weights of the attributes  provided that the overall attractiveness of the alternatives is approximately equal
OWNX	to study such choices and to test the validity of the cr strategy  we presented participants with individually tailored alternatives to choose from  each constructed to be approximately equal in attractiveness
MISC	assuming that multi-attribute utility mau  citation  could be used as an approximate indicator of alternative attractiveness  the alternatives were constructed such that they were equal in mau based on attributes and attribute weights that participants generated themselves
MISC	the study focused on how participants quickly find the promising alternative i e   a tentative or preliminary choice  rather than on how they build up a complex argumentation structure to justify a final choice  citation
OWNX	we asked jurors awaiting trial assignment to listen to a recorded synopsis of an authentic criminal trial and to make a choice among  number  verdict possibilities
MISC	analysis of the transcripts of these deliberations revealed both characteristics general to the sample and characteristics for which variation appeared across participants
OWNX	more frequently than challenging the other's statements  we found  a juror agreed with and added to or elaborated them
MISC	epistemological stance - whether knowledge was regarded as absolute and certain or subject to interpretation - predicted several characteristics of discourse
MISC	absolutists were less likely to make reference to the verdict criteria in their discourse
MISC	those who did so  as well as those who made frequent reference to the evidence  were more likely to persuade their discourse partners
MISC	the discourse by means of which jurors reach their verdict decisions arguably falls into this category
MISC	jury deliberation is a component of a democratic legal system traditionally shrouded in secrecy
MISC	even if it were more available to external observers  the complexity of  number  individuals engaged in largely unconstrained dialog about controversial and often intricate matters is so great as to challenge analysis of the process
MISC	unsurprisingly  then  the bulk of jury research has been devoted to an examination of influences on jury outcomes  rather than the deliberation process itself
MISC	the research that does exist on the deliberation process typically is concerned with social influence processes  and has little to say about the phenomenon of key interest to us here - the reasoning by means of which jurors influence one another
MISC	jurors awaiting trial assignment were asked to listen to a tape-recorded synopsis constructed from the transcript of an actual trial and to make a verdict judgment
MISC	an individual juror's task  two of us have argued earlier  is one of theory-evidence coordination  citation
MISC	the juror needs to construct multiple theories story-verdict constellations that are evaluated against the presented evidence
OWNX	a specific prediction we test here is therefore that the nature of representations of both will affect the nature and outcome of jurors' deliberation
MISC	individual variation data are consistent with such a model
MISC	kuhn et al citation  found that individuals at more advanced epistemological levels who believe that absolute certainty is not possible  and who also tend to be more highly educated  were more likely to choose more moderate intermediate verdicts  number  degree murder or manslaughter in their individual verdict choices
MISC	performance was also related to a number of argument skills - e g   discounting  counterargument  justifying alternative verdict - that require evidence-theory coordination  citation
OWNX	specifically  we pose two research questions
MISC	does jurors' discourse in fact have these characteristics
MISC	education level has been found a strong predictor of individual juror reasoning  citation  and therefore could be anticipated to affect discourse between jurors as well
MISC	however  by itself  education level is a complex  largely opaque variable
MISC	what is likely to make the more educated individual a more incisive reasoner in a juror context
OWNX	here we investigate level of epistemological understanding as a likely candidate
MISC	research on epistemological understanding  citation  has identified three broad levels of understanding  absolutist an absolute  objective truth can be determined  multiplist subjectivity of interpretation and judgment is recognized and given priority  and evaluativist subjectivity is recognized but does not preclude evaluation and judgment of conflicting interpretations
OWNX	these different levels of understanding regarding the nature of knowing and certainty  we propose  are implicated in the education difference in juror behavior  and similarly may have implications for the ways in which jurors talk to one another and hence conduct their decision-making task
OWNX	specifically  we predict that the absolutist conception of knowledge as certain and objectively knowable works against execution of the theory evidence coordination entailed in the juror task
MISC	the multiplist or relativist conception of knowledge as entirely subjective is more open to examination from multiple perspectives  yet omits the judgmental component characteristic of the evaluativist conception  in which multiple perspectives can be compared and evaluated in a framework of argument and evidence
MISC	individuals are often ambiguity-averse when choosing among purely chance-based prospects  citation
MISC	however  they often prefer apparently ambiguous ability-based prospects to unambiguous chance-based prospects
MISC	according to the competence hypothesis  citation   this pattern derives from favorable perceptions of one's competence
MISC	in most past tests of the competence hypothesis  ambiguity is confounded with personal controllability and the source of the ambiguity e g   chance vs missing information
OWNX	we unconfound these factors in three experiments and find strong evidence for independent effects of both ambiguity aversion and competence
MISC	in experiment  number   participants preferred an unambiguous chance-based option to an ambiguous ability-based option when the ambiguity derived from chance rather than uncertainty about one's own ability
MISC	in experiments  number  and  number   which used different operationalizations of ambiguity in choice contexts with actual consequences  participants attempted to avoid both ambiguity and chance insofar as they could
MISC	  most people abide by this logic when choosing between options with known probabilities and others that have ambiguous probabilities or second-order uncertainty
MISC	people often choose the former - manifesting what decision scientists call  ambiguity aversion
MISC	  in a classic demonstration by ellsberg  citation   decision makers faced a choice between two urns  one contained  number  percent  red and  number  percent  black marbles whereas the other had an unknown distribution
MISC	selection of a marble of a specified color produced a monetary prize
MISC	participants showed no color preference  but they did show a clear preference for the  number   number  urn
MISC	later work showed that people prefer the unambiguous urn even when the expected value of the other ambiguous urn is higher  citation   and that they are willing to pay more an  ambiguity premium  to draw from the  number   number  urn  citation
MISC	several persuasive explanations have been offered to account for ambiguity aversion
MISC	these authors also suggest that people are concerned about the blame and regret that may follow a decision made in the context of missing information
MISC	as an example  parents are relatively less willing to vaccinate their children in a setting where the characteristics of children who experience side effects from the vaccination are unspecified  citation
MISC	similarly  heath and tversky  citation  argue that participants in the ellsberg paradigm mentally simulate the attributions that will be made following selection of the marble  and consequently worry about being blamed if the ambiguous urn turns out to present a smaller chance of winning
MISC	indeed  curley  yates  and abrams  citation  observed that ambiguity aversion is greater when the contents of the ambiguous urn will be revealed to others
MISC	an important feature of the ellsberg paradigm is that the contents of the ambiguous urn are knowable - just unknown to the participants
MISC	the outcome of the decision also hinges on chance and is not in any way tethered to participants' own knowledge or abilities
MISC	heath and tversky  citation  suggest that if people feel competent in the decision domain - and if competence is related to the outcome - they should exhibit less ambiguity aversion
MISC	in an illustrative study  participants predicted outcomes of american football games over a five-week period and also assessed their own knowledge about each game
MISC	they then chose between betting on the team they predicted would win or a lottery in which the chances of winning were identical but determined by chance
MISC	as long as participants perceived the probability of winning to be   number  or higher  those with higher perceived knowledge chose the bet over the lottery  suggesting that perceptions of competence in the domain attenuated ambiguity aversion
MISC	similar findings emerged in contexts where voters made predictions about outcomes in the november  number  presidential election and where students made predictions about future news events  citation
MISC	competence in the decision domain likely reduced the perception of missing information that frisch and baron posited to be key to ambiguity aversion
MISC	thus  heath and tversky proposed that perceived competence affects perceived ambiguity and does not have an independent effect of its own
MISC	however  other characteristics of this decision paradigm suggest that competence has an independent effect
MISC	most importantly  people generally prefer controllable to uncontrollable outcomes  citation   and are more optimistic about the outcomes of controllable outcomes  citation
MISC	in most though not all tests of the competence hypothesis  the unambiguous option is chance-determined  meaning that the manipulation of competence may be confounded with outcome controllability
MISC	if the probabilities of the skill-based option were ambiguous  participants might still choose the skill option  suggesting they prefer skill over chance  enough to override any opposing effect of ambiguity
MISC	controllability  rather than ambiguity  may also account for the choice of betting on familiar vs unfamiliar domains of competence e g   weather in one's own geographical area vs weather in a distal unknown geographical area  given that familiarity or proximity can be conflated with controllability due to magical thinking  citation
MISC	another possibility in the current context is that people are responding not to competence or controllability per se but rather to the reason for the ambiguity
MISC	that is  ambiguity could have different effects depending on its source
MISC	in tests of the competence hypothesis  the ability-based option is ambiguous because it is not associated with a clearly stated probability of winning as there is for the chance option
MISC	the ambiguity is instead related to natural variation in competence and perceptions of competence  thereby confounding the source of ambiguity with competence
MISC	if the ambiguity associated with the ability-based option derived from factors unrelated to personal competence  such as chance  it is likely that the ability-based option would become less appealing
OWNX	we report three experiments that systematically separate ambiguity from controllability and the source of ambiguity in order to determine whether people continue to exhibit ambiguity aversion as predicted by the competence hypothesis
MISC	in experiment  number   participants face a choice between an unambiguous chance-based prospect and an ambiguous ability-based prospect
MISC	importantly  the latter prospect is ambiguous because its difficulty is determined by chance
OWNX	we predicted that decision-makers would prefer the chance-based option - contrary to the typical pattern in tests of the competence hypothesis but nevertheless illustrative of ambiguity aversion
MISC	experiment  number  builds on this study by presenting participants with a chance option  a low-ambiguity ability-based option with approximately a  number  percent  chance of winning  and a high-ambiguity ability-based option with win probabilities ranging from  number  percent - number  percent 
OWNX	in this experiment  we also give participants performance feedback upon which to base their choices rather than relying on a priori beliefs about competence
MISC	experiment  number  builds on the standard competence hypothesis paradigm by pitting two ability-based options against each other while independently manipulating the level of ambiguity
OWNX	finally  we ask participants to make the same choice for someone else  thereby completely separating ambiguity from controllability
MISC	if ambiguity aversion is independent of controllability  then choices for other people should mirror those for the self
MISC	experiment  number  tests a similar hypothesis using a different operationalization of ambiguity which again is unaffected by personal controllability
MISC	an additional characteristic of previous studies in this literature is that the probability of winning the chance-based option was always unambiguous i e   a fixed probability
OWNX	in experiments  number  and  number   we also introduce ambiguity to the chance-based option in the form of a range of probabilities
MISC	doing so provides an even more conservative test of whether preference for ability-based tasks in previous tests was due to ambiguity or simply a preference for ability-based over chance-based tasks
OWNX	in sum  we report three experiments designed to test and extend the competence hypothesis
MISC	studies include both hypothetical and actual choices and in the final two experiments more than one ability-based choice
MISC	they should prefer chance-based options only when the ability options are more ambiguous  but when choosing among similar ability-based options they should prefer those lower in ambiguity
OWNX	we conclude that the evidence that unconscious thinking helps experts to make better predictions is tenuous both from theoretical and statistical perspectives
MISC	the literature on unconscious processing is vast and there is evidence that such processes can influence judgments  memory  and behavior  citation
MISC	an intriguing new theory  unconscious thought theory  citation  holds that the unconscious is a highly sophisticated  rational system that can make better decisions in complex situations than conscious thought  citation
MISC	furthermore  according to a recent publication  experts who think unconsciously can make better use of diagnostic information and arrive at better predictions than non-experts  or experts who think consciously  citation
OWNX	in the present article  we evaluate this claim and conclude that the hypothesis of superior performance by unconscious thinkers in a predictive judgment task is not conclusively substantiated statistically or theoretically
MISC	the current study looks at the role working memory plays in risky-choice framing
MISC	eighty-six participants took the automatic ospan  a measurement of working memory  this was followed by a risky-choice framing task
MISC	participants with high working memory capacities demonstrated well pronounced framing effects  while those with low working memory capacities did not
MISC	this pattern suggests that  in a typical risky-choice decision task  elaborative encoding of task information by those with high working memory capacity may lead them to a more biased decision compared to those with low working memory
MISC	many of these choices involve some aspect of risk  like choosing whether to invest in certain stocks  deciding on medical treatment options  or even deciding whether to risk human lives
MISC	the most studied examples of risk and decision making involve risky choices presented within a positive or negative framework  or risky-choice framing effects
MISC	risky-choice framing effects are derived from prospect theory predictions  citation  and have become one of the most studied examples of rational decision making
MISC	according to prospect theory the presentation of an outcome as either a loss or gain affects the amount of risk a person is willing to accept
MISC	this effect is attributed to differences in perceived subjective value and is captured by the value function  which is concave for gains  yielding risk-aversive preferences  and convex for losses  yielding risk-seeking preferences
MISC	in the most widely tested example  tversky and kahneman  citation  presented participants with an asian disease problem wherein  number  lives were at stake
MISC	participants were then presented with a set of alternatives  one risk-free and the other risky
MISC	the alternatives were framed either positively or negatively  in terms of people that would be  saved  or  die 
MISC	their findings revealed that  despite identical expected values  most participants preferred the risk-free alternative when the problem was framed positively and the risky alternative when framed negatively
MISC	affective forecasting with respect to two environmental risks ozone depletion  air pollution was investigated by studying tourists who travelled to either australia or bangkok and were thus confronted with one of these risks
OWNX	we measured anticipated outcome and anticipated emotions before the journey  actually experienced outcome and actually experienced emotions during the journey  and anticipated outcome and emotions concerning a future encounter with the same risk after the journey
MISC	results indicate that tourists underestimate air pollution or correctly predict ozone depletion both the seriousness of the outcome and their emotional reactions
MISC	furthermore  tourists learn from their travel experience and adjust their anticipations concerning future encounters with the environmental risk
MISC	findings suggest that the domain of environmental risks differs from personal outcomes with respect to the process of affective forecasting
MISC	over the course of the past decade  affect and emotions have evolved from neglected to 'hot' topics in the literature on human judgment and decision making  citation
MISC	even though the general importance of emotions in environmental risk perception has been acknowledged by some authors  not much research has specifically addressed this issue  citation
MISC	environmental risks differ in some important respects from personal risks or outcomes in that they are usually characterized by a more complex causal structure and low personal control  citation
MISC	whereas personal risks are taken by the same person who experiences the consequences  various actors and victims may be involved in the case of environmental risks  because they are often brought about by the collective actions of many individuals and also affect numerous heterogeneous groups of people who may be distributed over wide-spread regions of the world  citation
OWNX	we focus upon the role of anticipated emotions in environmental risk perception and upon the relationship between anticipated and actually experienced emotions
MISC	the anticipation of future emotions is often called affective forecasting  citation
MISC	that is  do anticipated emotions correspond to the emotions that are actually experienced when the future event takes place
MISC	b what is the basis for anticipated and experienced emotional reactions to environmental risks
MISC	that is  are they related to anticipated and experienced outcomes  respectively
MISC	c do people adjust their anticipated emotions based on experience
MISC	that is  if people anticipate their emotional reactions to some type of environmental damage and then experience their actual reactions to it  does this affect what emotional reactions they anticipate for future encounters with this type of environmental damage
OWNX	we chose two travel destinations and types of environmental damage  australia with ozone depletion and bangkok with air pollution
MISC	prior research has found mixed evidence for the long-theorized link between religiosity and pro-social behavior
MISC	i report a field experiment that examined when auction participants will respond to an appeal to continue bidding for secular charitable causes
MISC	religious individuals are more likely than non-religious individuals to respond to an appeal  for charity  only on days that they visit their place of worship  on other days of the week  religiosity has no effect
MISC	notably  the result persists after controlling for a host of factors that may influence bidding  but disappears when the appeal  for charity  is replaced by an appeal to bid for other i e   competitive reasons
MISC	psychologists  sociologists  anthropologists  and religious scholars  citation  have long posited a link between religiosity  defined as the degree to which one is involved in religious activities e g   prayer  church attendance  etc
MISC	and pro-social behavior e g   charitable giving  altruism  cooperation  helping  and volunteering
MISC	consistent with this  empirical investigations have repeatedly demonstrated that religiosity is a key predictor of self-reported pro-social behavior  citation
MISC	because self-reports are more likely than spontaneous behaviors to reflect a social desirability bias  citation   some have argued that religiosity is less linked to actual pro-social behaviors than it is to the desire to be seen by others and to see oneself as pro-social  citation
MISC	i hypothesize that pro-social behavior is linked not to religiosity per se  but rather to the salience of religion and religious norms  citation
MISC	because religious people are more likely to be in situations where religion is salient e g   in prayer  at church  etc
MISC	  they may in fact exhibit a greater propensity to behave pro-socially and to recall doing so in self-report surveys
MISC	in testing this hypothesis  the current investigation sets aside the oft-debated question   does religion make people nicer
MISC	   and instead asks   when does religion make people nicer
MISC	  i report on a field experiment that assesses whether and when religious vs non-religious auction participants respond to an appeal to continue bidding for non-religious charitable causes
MISC	the findings suggest that religious individuals are more likely to respond to an appeal for charity  but this effect is isolated to days on which they are likely to have attended their place of worship
MISC	prior research on the link between religion and pro-social behavior has insufficiently considered the role that environmental cues play in motivating behavior  citation
MISC	environmental cues can have non-conscious effects on behavior in social  citation  as well as private  citation  domains
MISC	for example  berger et al citation  find that voters are more likely to support an education initiative if their polling location the environmental cue happens to be a school vs some other location  and that this effect persists even after controlling for the voter's political views  demographic traits  and a host of other factors
MISC	these findings implicate the significant role that context plays in making behavioral norms salient
MISC	more specifically  research on priming effects demonstrates that environmental cues can activate relevant constructs in memory - and make them more accessible  citation
MISC	activation can also spread to related constructs that  in turn  guide judgment and behavior  citation
MISC	berger and fitzsimons  citation   for example  show that increased exposure to images of dogs can lead to increased activation and accessibility of a related category   cats   and to more positive evaluations of the puma brand of sneakers
MISC	likewise  hertel and kerr  citation  show that when there is ambiguity regarding the appropriate decision e g   whether to favor one's in-group  people will rely on normative scripts for guidance  the more accessible norms are more likely to be retrieved and to influence decision making
MISC	in the current context  i hypothesize that the link  if any  between religiosity and pro-social behaviors is to be found in the contextually triggered salience of religious norms
MISC	entirely consistent with this thesis  individuals have been shown to behave more cooperatively when they have been unconsciously primed with words associated with god and religion  citation
MISC	there is also evidence to suggest that those who are  intrinsically religious  e g   those who pray frequently - but not those who are  extrinsically religious  e g   those who are religious for social or political reasons - tend to be more pro-social in secular aspects of life  citation
MISC	these findings suggest that pro-social behavior may be associated less with religiosity i e   the degree to which one is religious than it is with the extent to which religion is salient at a particular time e g   due to a recent or impending trip to church
MISC	  this may help to explain why self-reported pro-social behavior is higher for religious people
MISC	the current investigation presents an experimental methodology that is able to separate religiosity viewed as a stable individual characteristic from religious salience triggered by contextual cues in a natural field setting  and which allows us to test whether these factors predict actual pro-social behavior
MISC	this article presents several studies that replicate and extend previous research on maximizing
MISC	the scale has adequate psychometric properties and reflects maximizers' aspirations for high standards and their preference for extensive alternative search  but not the decision difficulty aspect included in several previous studies
MISC	based on this scale  maximizing is positively correlated with optimism  need for cognition  desire for consistency  risk aversion  intrinsic motivation  self-efficacy and perceived workload  whereas the association with regret is inconsistent
MISC	analysis of correlates of the difficulty dimension suggests that decision difficulty should be conceptualized as a separate dimension rather than as a sub-dimension of maximizing
MISC	opportunities for future research are suggested
MISC	the distinction between maximizing and satisficing approaches to decision making has long been considered important in the decision making literature  citation
MISC	when maximizing  decision makers hope to find the best possible solution by systematically comparing available alternatives based on well-defined preferences
MISC	when satisficing  in contrast  decision makers aspire to find a solution that meets important minimum requirements and aspirations  i e   an option that is  good enough  rather than  the best 
MISC	schwartz et al citation  attracted considerable attention and interest when proposing that individuals differ in their global disposition to maximize versus satisfice in decision making
MISC	a new maximizing scale that was claimed to adequately measure individual maximizing tendency was presented
MISC	based on analysis of correlates of this scale  maximizers seemed to be less happy with life  to be less optimistic and to possess lower self-esteem
MISC	maximizers also appeared to be more prone to depression  perfectionism and regret as well as more inclined to engage in upward social comparison than satisficers
MISC	accordingly  schwartz  citation  argued that maximizing represents a recipe for unhappiness due to overly high expectations and self-fulfilling fears of regret
MISC	increased opportunities for choice were also claimed to represent a particular burden for maximizers  who would feel compelled to explore all possible opportunities and find it increasingly difficult to make a choice
MISC	this line of reasoning corresponds to schwartz's  citation  previous research on problems related to increased choice and the possible tyranny of freedom  and schwartz  citation  recommended that decision makers should make efforts to learn to accept  good enough  rather than searching for the elusive  best  as well as stop worrying about what they are missing
MISC	subsequent research has replicated several of the key results from schwartz et al 's  citation  studies and identified other negative correlates
MISC	for example  findings by parker  bruine de bruin and fischoff  citation  suggest that maximizing is associated with worse life outcomes  less behavioral coping  greater dependence on others and more decision avoidance
MISC	parker et al citation  argued that  if these relationships are causal  then it is of importance to teach normative decision making skills as well as to stress the benefits of satisficing in order to obtain better outcomes
MISC	inspired by the research opportunities associated with schwartz et al 's  citation  maximizing scale as well as the prospects of offering practical advice to decision makers  the scale was introduced to several groups of graduate students in business administration in norway
MISC	some groups responded to the original english version of the scale while other groups rated items on a pilot version in norwegian based on preliminary translations of items
MISC	surprisingly  hardly any of the subjects seemed to be maximizers based on their scores on the original maximizing scale  regardless of whether the scale was presented in the original english version or in the pilot-version in norwegian
MISC	all but very few subjects reported satisficing approaches to most of the tasks depicted in the items on the scale
MISC	yet  based on discussions of schwartz et al 's  citation  theoretical underpinnings  many subjects reported that they indeed considered themselves maximizers
MISC	however  many of the items on the scale were seen as too commonplace or too inconsequential to set off maximizing efforts
MISC	subjects also argued that many items referred to situations that were irrelevant to them
MISC	this feedback indicated that many items on the scale are not sufficiently general in terms of item content and simultaneously not sufficiently relevant to measure differences in individual maximizing tendency across samples  settings and cultures
MISC	these limitations in the construct validity of the scale have also been stressed by diab  gillespie and highhouse  citation   among others
MISC	however  schwartz et al 's  citation  scale comprises three distinct sub-dimensions and several items produce relatively weak or inconsistent factor loadings
MISC	accordingly  there has been a debate in the literature concerning the validity of the construct  the factor structure and reliability of the scale as well as the proposed correlates indicating that maximizers are less happy than satisficers
MISC	diab et al citation  asserted that the findings indicating that maximizers are less happy than satisficers need to be interpreted in light of inadequate definition and measurement of the core construct
MISC	based on the definition of individual maximizing tendency as the  general tendency to pursue the identification of the optimal alternative  diab et al citation  presented several alternative measures
MISC	as hypothesized  schwartz et al 's  citation  maximizing scale produced significantly higher correlations with maladaptive personality traits and dysfunctional decision making behaviors such as regret  indecisiveness  avoidance  neuroticism  and life-satisfaction than several of diab et al 's  citation  alternative measures  including their nine-item scale
MISC	nenkov  morrin  ward  schwartz and hulland  citation  also addressed the factor structure  reliability and validity of schwartz et al 's  citation  maximizing scale  and several short forms of the scale were tested using datasets from different populations
MISC	results replicated the three-factor solution from schwartz et al citation
MISC	nenkov et al citation  interpreted the first dimension to reflect preference for extensive alternative search  i e   the desire to continue seeking for even better options
MISC	the second dimension was interpreted to reflect decision difficulty  i e   decision makers' perceived difficulty in choosing and making decisions
MISC	the third dimension was taken to represent decision makers' tendency to hold high standards for themselves and their surroundings
MISC	however  although several short versions of schwartz et al 's  citation  scale appeared equally useful when analyzing correlates  the three sub-dimensions varied in their correlation with other variables
MISC	nenkov et al citation  therefore argued that the three dimensions should be examined separately in future research and that there is a need to resolve whether all or perhaps only one or two of the three sub-dimensions represent inherent components of the maximizing construct
MISC	the research reported by diab et al citation  and nenkov et al citation  suggests that the measurement of individual maximizing tendency is associated with several  fundamental  methodological problems that need to be resolved in order to advance research in this area
MISC	in view of the interest in schwartz et al 's  citation  seminal article  relatively few studies report empirical findings based on the original scale or refined versions of the scale so far
MISC	important exceptions include carrillat  edmondson and ladik's  citation  study of customer loyalty  iyengar  wells and schwartz's  citation  investigation of job search strategies  bruine de bruin  parker and fischoff's  citation  investigation of individual differences in decision making competence  parker  bruine de bruin and fischoff's  citation  exploration of decision making styles  competence  and outcomes  chowdhury  ratneshwar and mohanty's  citation  investigation of maximizing versus satisficing consumers  and lewer  gerlich and gretz'  citation  analysis of determinants of maximizing in consumer purchase
MISC	the first purpose  which derives from the lack of success when introducing schwartz et al 's  citation  scale to a new population  was to contribute to improving the measurement scale by testing original and new items across several new and large samples
MISC	the second purpose was to replicate and extend previous studies of correlates of individual maximizing tendency
MISC	improved insight into correlates may shed better light on maximizers' personality traits and the driving forces behind efforts to maximize in decision making
MISC	instrument development and testing across subjects and settings is important for practical as well as theoretical and methodological reasons
MISC	a reliable scale with adequate factor structure and discriminate validity would facilitate future research on maximizing  citation
MISC	the attention attracted to schwartz et al 's  citation  research also demonstrates that a reliable scale is of high interest and has high potential value for decision makers who wish to reflect on and improve their decision making
MISC	when making decisions that involve tradeoffs between the quality and timing of desirable outcomes  people consistently discount the value of future outcomes
MISC	a puzzling finding regarding such decisions is the extremely high rate at which people discount future monetary outcomes
MISC	most economists would argue that decision-makers should turn down only rates of return that are lower than those available to them elsewhere
MISC	yet the vast majority of studies find discount rates that are significantly higher than market interest rates  citation
OWNX	here we ask whether a lack of knowledge about the normative strategy can explain high discount rates
MISC	in an initial experiment  nearly half of subjects did not spontaneously cite elements of the normative strategy when asked how people should make intertemporal monetary decisions
MISC	this decline persisted  though attenuated  for at least one month
MISC	given the high level of discounting that remains  however  there are other contributing factors to high discount rates that remain to be quantified
MISC	several scholars have recognized the limitations of theories of moral reasoning in explaining moral behavior
MISC	they have argued that moral behavior may also be influenced by moral identity  or how central morality is to one's sense of self
MISC	this idea has been supported by findings that people who exemplify moral behavior tend to place more importance on moral traits when defining their self-concepts  citation
MISC	these results suggest that individuals with psychopathic traits may display immoral behavior partially because they do not construe their personal identities in moral terms
MISC	  individuals with psychopathic traits know the difference between right and wrong - at least in straightforward cases such as knowing whether an act is illegal
MISC	nevertheless  they often engage in frequent and flagrant bad behavior  citation
MISC	this discrepancy between the judgments people make about what they should do and their actual behavior is not unique to psychopathic individuals
MISC	research focusing on the discrepancies between judgment and choice has shed light on a key concept that may help to explain this discrepancy - that compared to judgment  choice elicits a greater degree of self-referent processing  citation
MISC	this refers to an evaluation of an option in relation to the individual's self-concept
MISC	individuals are aware that their choices are long-term reflections on their personality and are motivated to make choices that are consistent with their sense of self  citation
MISC	within the moral domain  this referencing to one's self-concept is called moral identity  citation
MISC	although prior research on moral behavior has primarily emphasized the role of reasoning and deliberation  citation   it has been suggested that moral identity is an important source of moral motivation that may help to account for the common disconnect between moral judgment and action  citation
MISC	previous studies have shown that moral identity is greater in individuals who are considered moral exemplars people whom others regard as highly moral  presumably partly due to their behavior  although these individuals do not necessarily have greater moral reasoning abilities  citation
MISC	however  studies have not explored whether moral identity is weaker in individuals with psychopathic traits
MISC	such weakness may contribute to the immoral behavior observed in psychopathy
MISC	oppenheimer and monin  citation  recently found that subjectively rare events are taken to indicate a longer preceding sequence of unobserved trials than subjectively common events  an effect which they refer to as the retrospective gambler's fallacy
MISC	participants were told about a streak produced by a random process coin flips or human performance basketball shots  and either predicted the next outcome or inferred the immediately preceding outcome
OWNX	for the coin scenarios  participants tended to expect streak termination - the gambler's fallacy - and this effect was the same for predictions and retrospective inferences
OWNX	in the basketball scenarios  no overall bias was found in either prospective or retrospective judgments
MISC	it is suggested that the term retrospective gambler's fallacy be used to describe situations where a streak is taken to indicate that the preceding unobserved outcome was of the opposite type  and that the phenomenon discovered by oppenheimer and monin be referred to as retrospective representativeness  or a retrospective belief in the law of small numbers
MISC	in a recent article in this journal  oppenheimer and monin  citation  raised the possibility that people's judgments about the past history of a random process might display the same biases as their predictions of future outcomes
MISC	the most common explanation of the gambler's fallacy is that people employ a representativeness heuristic - they believe in the  law of small numbers   citation   such that small samples should be representative of the underlying probabilities  a run of one outcome needs to be  balanced out  by the occurrence of the opposite outcome
MISC	oppenheimer and monin  citation  suggested that the gambler's fallacy might also operate when people reconstruct the past history of a random process
MISC	rather than having participants predict future outcomes  they asked people to estimate the number of trials that had preceded the occurrence of a particular event
MISC	for example  participants were asked to imagine walking into a room to find a man flipping a coin five times  either producing a streak of five heads or a mix of three heads and two tails
MISC	participants were then asked how many times the man had flipped the coin before they entered the room
MISC	the estimates of participants in the streak condition were much larger than those of participants in the non-streak condition
MISC	this result generalizes  across a wide variety of domains  oppenheimer and monin found that the estimated number of previous trials was greater when the outcome was subjectively unlikely  an effect they refer to as the retrospective gambler's fallacy
MISC	however  it is notable that the focus of oppenheimer and monin's  citation  work is not on the gambler's fallacy as traditionally conceived
MISC	rather than examining judgments about the outcomes of previous trials in a manner analogous to the prediction of future outcomes  the authors focussed on estimates of the number of preceding trials
MISC	the current experiment supplements oppenhemier  and  monin's  citation  work by providing such a test
MISC	participants were told about a streak of one outcome and asked either to predict the next outcome or to infer the outcome of the trial before the streak
MISC	as an additional manipulation  the data-generating process was varied  for some participants it was a physical process likely to be regarded as random coin flipping whilst for others it was a skill-based action basketball shooting
MISC	the motivation for this was that  although the gambler's fallacy is widespread  some judgment domains produce the opposite bias - the belief that a streak of one outcome increases the probability of that outcome  citation
MISC	what is the impact of additional decision-making time on choice accuracy
OWNX	we investigated these questions in four experiments in which subjects made binary food choices using saccadic or manual responses  under either  speed  or  accuracy  instructions
MISC	further  slowing down their responses by either asking them explicitly to be confident about their choices  or to respond with hand movements  generated about a  number  percent  increase in accuracy
MISC	consider  as an example  a trip to the local grocery store
MISC	while unfamiliar and high-stakes purchases often involve careful comparisons  casual observation suggests that many others are made at speeds that seem inconsistent with careful deliberation
MISC	this motivates an important open question in the psychology and neurobiology of decision-making  as well as in the domain of consumer research  what are the fastest speeds at which the human brain is capable of identifying the most valuable options
MISC	previous work on the computational and neurobiological basis of decision-making provides some clues
MISC	all of these models predict a speed-accuracy tradeoff  which has been observed in the data
MISC	however  this literature has not experimentally measured the fastest speeds at which value-based decisions can be made  citation
MISC	an examination of previous decision-making studies also suggest that decisions can be made quickly  but provide few clues about how fast these decisions can be made when speed is the goal  perhaps due to external constraints
MISC	for example  in krajbich  armel  and rangel  citation   hungry subjects made real choices between pairs of food stimuli displayed on a computer screen with reaction times rt that ranged from  number   number  seconds for the easiest choices to  number   number  for the most difficult ones
MISC	reaction times in the  number  ms range have been reported in various other choice studies  citation
MISC	studies examining more complex choices  those involving six to twelve options  have reported reaction times in the  number - number  seconds range  citation
MISC	however  work on the psychophysics of perceptual judgments suggests that the brain may be able to carry out the decisions computations much faster
MISC	vanrullen  and  thorpe  citation  found that subjects could distinguish between animals and vehicles in a go no-go task at similarly fast speeds mean rt of  number  ms for animals   number  ms for vehicles  minimum rt of  number  ms for animals   number  ms for vehicles as measured by earliest above-chance responses  differential erp activity detected in  number  ms for both tasks
MISC	further  kirchner  and  thorpe  citation  used a novel saccadic choice paradigm to show that a pair of natural scenes flashed in the left and right hemifields could be compared for the presence of one or more animals with a median rt of  number  ms  and a minimum rt of  number  ms
MISC	utilizing a similar paradigm  bannerman  milders  de gelder  and sahraie  citation  showed that subjects could distinguish a fearful facial expression or body posture from a neutral one in less than  number  ms mean rt
OWNX	finally  we recently showed that individuals can make magnitude comparisons between two single-digit numbers with high accuracy in  number  ms on average and are able to perform above chance in as little as  number  ms  citation
MISC	thus  given the similar computational demands  it is natural to hypothesize that the brain should be able to make accurate simple choices at much faster speeds than those that have been reported in the literature
MISC	what is the impact of additional computational time on choice accuracy
MISC	an important difficulty in answering these questions is that reaction time measures from standard choice paradigms overestimate the amount of time that it takes to make a decision i e   to compute and compare values  since they include the time that it requires to perceive the stimuli and to deploy the choice
MISC	first  since a significant fraction of decisions seems to be made at these speeds  it provides an insight into the general quality of human decision-making
MISC	the increased popularity of new technologies in which decisions are made with the click of a mouse further increases the importance of the question
MISC	labeling a food as  organic  entails a claim about its production but is silent on its calorie content
MISC	nevertheless  people infer that organic cookies are lower in calories and can be eaten more often than conventional cookies study  number 
MISC	these inferences are observed even when the nutrition label conveys identical calorie content and are more pronounced among perceivers high on pro-environmentalism
MISC	as americans' waistlines have grown  so has their appetite for organic foods u s
MISC	sales of organics rose from approximately   number  billion in  number  to   number  billion in  number   citation   meanwhile  roughly one-third of u s adults now qualify as obese  citation
MISC	yet  scant research has explored the implications of  organic  production claims for judgments and decisions related to weight gain
MISC	although organic claims license inferences about lower levels of conventional pesticides and synthetic additives in foods  citation   they are silent on calorie content
MISC	the tendency to overgeneralize health claims suggests this possibility
MISC	previous research has demonstrated that margarine advertised as  no cholesterol  and  healthy  is judged as lower in fat  citation  and that nutrient-based claims can promote calorie underestimation  thought to be an important factor in the obesity crisis  citation
MISC	it is not clear  however  whether such effects would extend to organic claims  which speak to production process and not nutrient content per se  citation
MISC	consistent with activation theory  citation   specific nutrient claims e g    no cholesterol  have been shown to affect judgments of closely associated nutrients e g   fat but not of more general  distal concepts e g   cancer risk  citation
MISC	from this perspective   organic  and other production-related claims may not be expected to activate  calories  and other nutrient-related concepts
MISC	on the other hand  a number of different theories suggest that organic claims might indeed bias - and specifically  reduce - calorie judgments
MISC	first  strong associations exist between the concepts  organic  and  healthy  in contemporary america  associations that are promoted by marketers and reflected in survey data in which most americans endorse organics as healthier  citation
MISC	moreover  natural foods as opposed to those altered by humans in some significant way tend to be seen as inherently good and healthy  citation   further supporting associations between organic production and healthy attributes
MISC	second  because calorie estimation is a cognitively demanding task  citation   consumers might even substitute the associatively related attribute  healthy  for  organic  as a means for simplifying complex calorie judgments  citation
MISC	third  consumers might go beyond the literal meaning of the producer's utterance  citation  and infer that a producer who adheres to organic production standards might also care about other health-related aspects of the product  again supporting more general inferences about the product's healthy attributes  citation
MISC	fourth  the logic of halo effects  citation  more generally suggests that consumers might judge products with one positive attribute more favorably on other attributes  even when they are not substantively related  if so  organics might be judged as lower-calorie to the extent that perceivers hold favorable attitudes toward organic production
MISC	because natural foods tend to be seen as inherently good and healthy  citation    organic  halos seem plausible given the back-to-nature connotations of organic production
MISC	these attitudes are likely to show more variation than attitudes toward health-related nutrient claims e g    no cholesterol    low-fat  and might vary partly as a function of individual differences in pro-environmentalism  citation
MISC	if so  people high on pro-environmentalism might be more affected by organic claims  reflecting that positive halo effects should increase with the positivity of the attitude toward the initial attribute here  organic production
MISC	despite different underlying assumptions  all of these considerations converge on the same core prediction  organic claims might reduce calorie judgments  making the consumption of organic foods seem more compatible with a weight-loss goal
MISC	the present studies test this prediction by assessing the effect of organic claims on perceived calorie content and consumption recommendations as well as the impact of organic consumption on the perceived need to exercise
OWNX	we also explore whether individuals high on pro-environmentalism are especially likely to show this effect  consistent with the halo logic outlined above
MISC	note  however  that an alternative prediction is also plausible  those high on pro-environmentalism may know more about organics  rendering them less susceptible to unwarranted inferences from organic claims
MISC	when faced with a choice  people can normally select no option  i e   defer choice
MISC	previous research has investigated when and why individuals defer choice  but has almost never looked at these questions when groups of people make choices
MISC	separate reasons predict that groups may be equally likely  more likely  or less likely than individuals to defer choice
MISC	assuming that the groups used a plurality rule but gave additional weight to individual preferences to defer choice allowed the groups' responses to be predicted quite well
MISC	when given a choice  as well as being able to select one option  people are often also able to select none of the options  that is  to defer choice
MISC	many of these choices are not made alone  but by a group of people  be it family members  friends  or colleagues
MISC	the current research investigates who is more likely to defer choice  groups making choices collectively or members of those groups making choices individually
MISC	it is possible to think of situations in which groups are more likely to defer choice compared to their members - just think of any time you were assigned to a committee of people who could not reach a decision  even though each of the individual members had a clear preference
MISC	in contrast  some established principles of group decision making suggest that groups may be less likely to defer choice than their members
MISC	the phenomenon of groupthink implies  for instance  that members who are hesitant to make a decision as individuals are swayed by the team spirit
MISC	as a consequence  groups may be more prone than some of their members to make hasty decisions rather than to delay a decision  citation
MISC	empirical evidence concerning whether groups or individuals are more likely to defer choice appears to be non-existent
MISC	the validity of the rds was tested in three studies
MISC	results showed that only the rds clearly differentiated between the constructs of regret and disappointment
MISC	study  number  confirmed the validity of the rds in a real-life scenario  in which both feelings of regret and disappointment could be experienced
MISC	study  number  showed the advantages of the rds over the traditional methods in gambling situations commonly used in decision making research  and provided evidence for the convergent validity of the rds
MISC	for example  we typically experience feelings of happiness and elation after having made a decision that leads to a good outcome for us
MISC	the emotion that is most frequently studied by decision theorists is regret  a counterfactual emotion that one experiences after realizing or imagining that a better outcome could have been obtained  had one decided differently
MISC	the experience of regret depends on choice- or behavior-focused counterfactual thoughts  and its intensity varies in relation to the availability of counterfactual alternatives  citation
MISC	economists and psychologists have been investigating the relation between regret and choice since the early  number 's  and there is now a general consensus concerning the influence of anticipated regret on decision making
MISC	specifically  the anticipation of regret can increase the attractiveness of certain alternatives  citation
MISC	the same process can also function to promote health safety behavior  citation  and computer security behavior  citation
MISC	although receiving less empirical focus  the effects of experienced regret have been more debated
MISC	for example  some studies have shown that feelings of regret diminish consumer satisfaction and intention to repeat purchases  citation  and that it also lowers ultimatum game players' offers  citation
MISC	other authors  however  have found that experienced regret has a lower impact than is generally assumed  citation
MISC	yet  although regret and disappointment are different emotions  they are both generated by comparing  what is  with  what might have been 
MISC	the emotion of regret results from a comparison between an actual outcome and a better outcome that might have occurred had another option been chosen choice- or behavior-focused counterfactuals
MISC	conversely  disappointment stems from the comparison of an actual outcome with a better outcome that might have resulted had world events occurred differently situation-focused counterfactuals  citation
OWNX	here we test this hypothesis in an international survey with  number  respondents from india and  number  from us where we ask questions about a hypothetical lottery
OWNX	in both countries we find that emotions about outcomes are stronger among women  and that this effect partially mediates gender difference in willingness to enter the lottery
OWNX	why do women engage in less risky behaviors than men
MISC	prior work demonstrates that females' lower risk preferences and less risky behavior is robust across a variety of contexts  citation
OWNX	women  for instance  are substantially less likely than men to enter lotteries  citation
MISC	a number of meta-theoretical perspectives - from structural role theories  citation  to evolutionary approaches  citation  - are consistent with these observations
MISC	however  only recently have researchers begun to study underlying causal mechanisms of these gender differences
MISC	there are several possible explanations of gender differences in entering lotteries
OWNX	the authors hypothesized that a tendency for women to experience stronger emotional reactions to outcomes may explain gender differences in risk preferences
MISC	the goal of the current study is to address this heretofore untested hypothesis using a cross-national sample
OWNX	to elaborate  the tendency for women to experience stronger emotional reactions would explain gender differences in risky financial decisions  such as whether to enter a lottery  if a compared to men  women evaluated losing more strongly  and b the strength of negative evaluations of losing predicted decisions about whether to enter lotteries
OWNX	thus  we predict that evaluations of losing will mediate gender differences in tendencies to join lotteries
MISC	but  assuming for the moment that females tend to experience stronger emotional reactions to all outcomes as suggested by croson and gneezy  they would also experience stronger positive reactions to winning
OWNX	we argue that the typical setup of lotteries that assigns much higher probabilities of losing than of winning does not allow stronger positive reactions to winning to counterbalance stronger negative reactions to losing
MISC	in other words  because people know that they are most likely to lose  the expected emotional reactions to losing lotteries should be a much stronger predictor of decisions to enter them than expected emotional reactions to winning lotteries
MISC	results from a recent study by harris et al citation  are consistent with this hypothesis
MISC	using a sample of undergraduate psychology students  these researchers measured gender differences in stated likelihood of engaging in a variety of risky behaviors
MISC	the researchers found that  in most domains  females weighed negative outcomes more strongly than did males
MISC	further  compared to males  females expected negative outcomes to occur with a greater likelihood
OWNX	but  to the extent that decision-makers overestimate the likelihood of negatively valued events  citation   we cannot know for certain whether gender differences in reactions to losing explain gender differences in lottery decisions
MISC	thus  one goal of the current reseaerch is to make the probabilities of winning and losing known and explicit  and measure gender differences in evaluations of winning and losing under these conditions
OWNX	the study outlined in the section to follow tests the hypotheses using amazon's mechanical turk
MISC	users tend to be disproportionately from the u s and india
OWNX	thus  our dataset allows us to test the robustness of our hypotheses using men and women from two different continents
MISC	prior work  citation  addressing cross-cultural differences in risk taking found that americans tend to be less risk seeing than chinese
MISC	hsee and weber use the  cushion hypothesis  to explain these cross-national differences  arguing that in times of financial need  decision makers in collectivist cultures can rely on network ties for help
OWNX	thus  we might expect to observe more risk taking among indians than americans
OWNX	we investigated the extent to which the human capacity for recognition helps to forecast political elections  we compared naive recognition-based election forecasts computed from convenience samples of citizens' recognition of party names to i standard polling forecasts computed from representative samples of citizens' voting intentions  and to ii simple-and typically very accurate-wisdom-of-crowds-forecasts computed from the same convenience samples of citizens' aggregated hunches about election results
MISC	results from four major german elections show that mere recognition of party names forecast the parties' electoral success fairly well
MISC	recognition-based forecasts were most competitive with the other models when forecasting the smaller parties' success and for small sample sizes
MISC	however  wisdom-of-crowds-forecasts outperformed recognition-based forecasts in most cases
MISC	yet it seems that a simple extension of the recognition-based forecasts-asking people what proportion of the population would recognize a party instead of whether they themselves recognize it-is also able to eliminate these downsides
MISC	this did not only bother brezhnev  but also keeps polling agencies busy around the world
MISC	they usually rely on intention-based election forecasts  generated by interviewing large representative samples of citizens about their voting intentions
MISC	for instance  in germany potential voters are typically asked which political party they will vote for in an upcoming election
OWNX	here  we investigate how far one can get with a much simpler  almost naive  method that does not require large and representative samples
MISC	the article is structured as follows
OWNX	third  we introduce election forecasts based on the wisdoms of the crowds
MISC	in tasks with cue information presented in on-screen displays  rule-based strategies tend to dominate unless the abstraction of cue-target relations is unfeasible
MISC	this dominance has also been demonstrated - surprisingly - in experiments that demanded the retrieval of cue values from memory  citation
MISC	the former representation might hinder cue abstraction
MISC	the cues were predictive of the severity of the disease  and participants had to infer in each trial who of two patients was sicker
MISC	both experiments replicated the rule-dominance with present-absent cues but yielded higher percentages of exemplar-based strategies with alternative cues
OWNX	the experiments demonstrate that a change in cue representation may induce a dramatic shift from rule-based to exemplar-based reasoning in formally identical tasks
MISC	in making choices between objects people express either preferences which bike do i like more
OWNX	often  multiple pieces of information about attributes or probabilistic cues have to be combined
MISC	traditionally  decision researchers formulate decision strategies as processing steps that somehow integrate the cues  either in a weighted additive fashion  citation   or according to noncompensatory rules like lexicographic orderings  citation
MISC	numerous strategies have been proposed  and participants appear to choose between them adaptively  citation
MISC	however  in categorization  exemplar-based models assuming the storage and retrieval of feature patterns as a basis for inference  rather than piecemeal cue integration cue abstraction models  cam  have proven successful  citation
MISC	juslin and his colleagues explored the applicability of exemplar models to multiple cue judgment tasks and found successes as well as failures  citation
MISC	persson and rieskamp  citation  extended juslin's approach to memory-based decisions in which cue values had to be retrieved from memory rather than being presented by the experimenter i e  during the judgmental phase of the experiments  participants received only the stimulus names  and all of their respective attributes - which had been learned beforehand - had to be retrieved from long term memory
MISC	to their surprise  p and r did not find more exemplar-based decision making  rather  most participants adopted cam
OWNX	we will test the conjecture that retrieval from memory per se does not induce exemplar-based decisions  whereas the difficulty of cue abstraction in combination with memory retrieval does
MISC	considerable research has pointed towards processing differences as a viable means for understanding the strength and likelihood of a framing effect
OWNX	in the current study we explored how differences in processing may emerge through diurnal patters in circadian rhythm  which varies across individuals
OWNX	we predicted that during circadian off-times  participants would exhibit stronger framing effects whereas framing effects would be relatively weaker during on-times
OWNX	six-hundred and eighty five individuals took part in the study  the findings supported our hypothesis  revealing a diurnal pattern of risk responding that varies across the  number -hour circadian cycle
MISC	the most studied examples of risk and decision making revolve around risky-choice framing  citation   which has its foundations in prospect theory  citation
MISC	according to prospect theory  the presentation of an outcome as either a loss or gain affects the amount of risk a person is willing to accept
MISC	this effect is due to differences in perceived subjective value and is captured by the s-shaped value function
MISC	this function is concave for gains  which leads to risk-averse preferences  and convex for losses  which leads to preference for risky alternatives
MISC	in the most well known example of this framing effect  participants read of an asian disease that will potentially kill  number  people  citation
MISC	the participant is then asked to choose between two alternatives for dealing with the disease
MISC	the alternatives are presented either positively people saved or negatively people die
MISC	people tend to choose the certain risk free option when the problem is framed positively and the risky option when it is framed negatively
MISC	while this framing effect has proved enduring  a number of studies have pointed toward processing differences as a determining factor for the strength of this framing effect
MISC	one of the most widely investigated personality factors in framing research is need-for-cognition nfc  citation
MISC	this personality trait reflects the extent to which people engage in effortful thought and how much they enjoy doing so
MISC	research has shown that framing effects are lessened for individuals who are high in nfc  citation
MISC	related research has shown that merely requesting an elaboration or rationale  citation  can influence the likelihood of framing effects
MISC	other research has shown that presenting a task as either high or low in personal importance  which should lead to more or less effortful processing respectively  influences the likelihood of framing effects  citation
MISC	overall  the findings from these studies tend to show that  when more effort is involved in the task  this framing effect is attenuated  with one exception  citation
MISC	in a somewhat similar approach  research from fuzzy-trace theory  citation  has shown that  when greater  gist like  memory retrieval is used  framing effects are robust whereas  when the more precise  verbatim  retrieval is relied on  framing effects are less evident
MISC	recent investigations have shown support for fuzzy trace as a viable means for understanding framing effects  citation
MISC	one ability factor that has been identified is numeracy  which refers to the propensity to integrate complex numeric information
MISC	in an investigation of another individual difference variable  frederick  citation  used a cognitive reflection test to show that risky-choice framing effects were attenuated for people relying on more conscious  deliberative processing and more robust for people using more automatic processing
MISC	similar findings were reported by oechssler  roider   and  schmitz  citation
MISC	other research has shown that ability differences may influence this framing effect
MISC	in one study  stanovich and west  citation  found that individuals with relatively higher cognitive ability  as measured by sat scores  were less likely to exhibit framing effects
MISC	later research has shown that working memory also plays a role in framing effects  citation  but the exact nature of this role has not been completely defined
MISC	recently  however  stanovich and west  citation  have reexamined their original assumptions in a larger study and their findings seem to call their prior hypotheses for framing effects into question
MISC	taken together  these findings create a picture of how framing effects can differ across individuals and situations
MISC	clearly the type of processing involved can have important and predictable influences on the choices people make
MISC	these findings suggest that framing effects will be less likely when a person is being more thoughtful  diligent  or involved in the decision task
MISC	a variety of factors may influence the effort and deliberative processing a person uses
MISC	is variety of the spice of life
MISC	decision makers  however  seem to under-appreciate the influence of consumption rate on preference for and satisfaction with variety
MISC	at high rates of consumption  they correctly anticipate their own  high  desire for variety  but at low rates of consumption people tend to overestimate their own desire for variety
MISC	these results complicate the picture presented by prior research on the  diversification bias   suggesting that people overestimate their own desire for variety only when consumption is spaced out over time
MISC	the dictum  variety is the spice of life  notwithstanding  people seem to show a surprising tolerance  even preference  for repetition
MISC	whether a favorite snack  pop song  or piece of art  people routinely expose themselves to the same liked stimulus repeatedly
MISC	indeed  prior work has shown that people even surprise themselves with this preference  research on the  diversification bias  has consistently shown that people predict a greater preference for variety and aversion to repetition than they show in their online  immediate preferences  citation
MISC	for example  when shopping for the week's supply of yogurt a person might supplement his or her favorite flavor say  strawberry with one or more less preferred alternatives say  vanilla  only to find a surplus of the less preferred flavor at the end of the week  citation
MISC	this apparent tolerance for repetition conflicts not only with people's own intuitions  but with on the surface  at least existing models of taste and satiation
MISC	a central tenet of most psychological and economic theories of taste is that enjoyment of enjoyable stimuli declines with repetition  citation
MISC	if people repeatedly consume a product  it is thought  they become satiated-and enjoyment decreases
MISC	indeed  in one illustrative study  participants listened to a  number -second sample of a favorite song  number  times in quick succession  rating their enjoyment of the experience along the way
MISC	what began as an enjoyable experience became decidedly less so after only the  number  iteration  citation
MISC	how can these seeming inconsistencies-the revealed preference for repetition shown in studies on the diversification bias and the aversion to repetition shown in studies like the above-be reconciled
MISC	one key to the discrepancy may lie in the inter-consumption interval the time between acts of consumption
MISC	this difference is likely to be of critical importance in light of the inherently fleeting nature of satiation
MISC	although people can and do satiate to a given stimulus  such satiation tends to be relatively short-lived  citation
MISC	with time  people's preferences typically return to their pre-consumption level
MISC	just as a muscle  citation  weakens in the short-term through repeated use  but replenishes over time  satiation seems to have the same property
MISC	whereas the same snack or pop song grows tiresome if repeated in quick succession  the drop-off in enjoyment may be much smaller  or even non-existent  if there is a sufficient gap between consumption intervals
MISC	and if rate of consumption influences the desirability of repetition  it logically follows that it should influence the desirability of its logical complement-variety-as well
MISC	are people aware of the influence of rate of consumption on satiation
MISC	most of us realize that the same favorite food would quickly grow tiresome if served as an appetizer  entree  and dessert at the same sitting-whereas those same three servings would be perfectly palatable if spread out over a month
MISC	and yet  research seems to show that people consistently underestimate their liking for repetition and overestimate their liking for its complement  variety  at least when consumption is spaced  citation
MISC	why
MISC	one reason is  time contraction   citation
MISC	people tend to underweight the importance of time when predicting their preferences for novelty and liking for repetition  imagining lengthy intervals as if they were short ones
MISC	when predicting their snack preferences over the course of a week  for instance  people think about how unappetizing the same food item would be if consumed in rapid succession  forgetting that time tends to reset one's preferences
MISC	consistent with time contraction  read and loewenstein  citation  showed that merely drawing people's attention to the otherwise neglected inter-consumption interval decreased the predicted and  in this instance  inaccurate preference for variety
MISC	note  however  that the time contraction explanation for this unwarranted preference applies only to lengthy inter-consumption intervals
MISC	to the extent that people underestimate their liking for repetition because they imagine a short inter-consumption interval  those predictions should be more calibrated when the inter-consumption interval is in fact short
MISC	in other words  as the inter-consumption interval decreases  predicted preference for variety should align with in-experience and thus actual preferences
MISC	a straightforward prediction naturally follows from this hypothesis concerning people's satisfaction with the choices they make in advance
MISC	as already mentioned  prior work on the diversification bias has consistently shown that people choose greater variety when deciding for future consumption than when deciding in the moment
MISC	it should come as no surprise  then  that people are sometimes dissatisfied with the degree of variety they select prospectively  citation
MISC	specifically  as the inter-consumption interval decreases  satisfaction with choices made in advance should increase
MISC	experiment  number  explores whether enjoyment of repetition and aversion to variety increases as the inter-consumption interval increases
MISC	experiment  number  examines whether the tendency to choose more variety in prospect than in the moment-the diversification bias-decreases as the inter-consumption interval decreases
MISC	experiment  number  also examines whether this causes people to be more satisfied with the consumption choices they make in advance as the inter-consumption interval decreases
MISC	experiment  number  extends these results by varying the length of the inter-consumption interval and observing the nature of the relationship between this interval  preference for variety  and subsequent enjoyment

MISC	the decision-making literature suggests people are ill-equipped to incorporate information about rare side effects into their decisions  citation
MISC	when information about a rare event comes externally from a description  as from a warning  people tend to overweigh the rare event in their decisions  citation
MISC	in other words  people behave as if the rare event is more likely to occur than its objective probability
MISC	conversely  when people learn from their own experiences  they tend to underweigh rare events  behaving as if the event is less likely to occur than its objective probability  citation
MISC	a recent literature has focused on the mechanisms underlying this apparent  gap  between description- and experience-based decisions and their relative importance  citation
MISC	the mechanisms include  number  recency - when rare events happen in the distant past and memory is constrained  decisions will rely on a small set of past outcomes   number  statistical sample bias - as rare events are underrepresented more often than overrepresented due to the skewness of the binomial distribution  and  number  judgment bias - as people incorrectly estimate an event's likelihood even in an unbiased sample
MISC	in deciding whether to adhere to a given warning  people who have previously used the risk-causing agent are subject to potentially conflicting influences from the warning and past experience
MISC	others  possessing little or no experience with the risk-causing agent  are presumably more reliant upon the warning
MISC	research has shown that inertia tends to guide the risk-taking behavior of people who have had safe experiences with the risk-causing agent  such that they continue their exposure to the agent despite new information about associated dangers  citation
MISC	the fda warning created an opportunity to examine this behavior as applied to a risk-causing agent that affects millions of parents and children  with clear implications for health policy
MISC	even if a warning with the appropriate content reaches and is understood by its target audience  recipients may still not know what to believe if communicators are perceived to have a vested interest  citation
MISC	in the united kingdom  for example  parents' decisions not to vaccinate against measles  mumps  and rubella mmr - despite assurances and campaigns by the uk government - stemmed largely from lack of trust in messages about the safety of these vaccines  citation
OWNX	thus  in order to isolate the effect of experience on adherence  we also measured parents' stated trust in the fda as a source of information
OWNX	on the basis of our findings  we propose a tentative strategy for increasing adherence
MISC	indecisiveness is an individual difference measure of chronic difficulty and delay in decision making
MISC	the present study explored whether the confidence levels and search behaviors associated with individual indecisiveness also emerge in group decision making contexts
MISC	in this study   number  decisive and indecisive participants were assigned to make a decision individually or in a homogenous three-person group
MISC	indecisiveness score was found to predict participant decisional confidence in the individual condition but not in the group condition  with group participants being overall more confident than individuals
MISC	similar results were obtained for other related measures of participants' perceptions of the decision task
MISC	the results provide initial evidence that indecisiveness does not influence group decision making and that  especially for indecisive individuals  working in groups may be a way to boost decisional confidence
MISC	indecisiveness is an individual difference measure associated with chronic difficulty and delay in decision making  citation
MISC	self-report descriptors include  taking a long time to decide  not knowing how to decide  feeling uncertain during decision making  avoiding decisions  changing ones mind  and regretting decisions  citation
MISC	given that the tendencies of indecisive individuals appear poorly adapted to many tasks  citation   an important goal is to identify circumstances in which indecisiveness is likely to compromise effective decision making
MISC	the present research is motivated by the question of whether the relationship between indecisiveness and patterns of decision making in informational search contexts observed with individuals extends to groups
OWNX	in the introduction  we first review past empirical work establishing a relationship between indecisiveness  decisional confidence  and informational search patterns
OWNX	we then motivate our interest in exploring these relationships in a group decision making context  and integrate relevant group literature
OWNX	finally  we present an empirical study of the relationship between indecisiveness and patterns of decision making in individuals versus small groups
OWNX	in study  number   we conducted a  number  probability level  higher vs lower x  number  reference information  yes vs no x  number  subjective numeracy  higher vs lower between-subjects design
MISC	persons with lower numeracy tended to differentiate between a higher and a lower probability when there was no reference information
MISC	persons with lower numeracy differentiated between higher and lower risk only when they were in the non-counting first condition
MISC	task sequence did not influence the risk perceptions of persons with higher numeracy
MISC	however  these groups seem to process the graph differently
MISC	persons with higher numeracy rely more on the numerical information depicted in the graph  whereas persons with lower numeracy seem to be confused when they are guided towards these numbers
MISC	patients are often confronted with difficult medical decisions
MISC	many of these decisions have to be made based on numerical information  citation
MISC	therefore  it is quite important that this information is understood correctly
MISC	past research has shown that many people have difficulties understanding numerical risk information  citation   and that persons with low numeracy skills the ability to understand numbers are especially challenged by numerical information  citation
MISC	therefore  not surprisingly  more and more studies show that low numeracy is associated with less understanding of medical information and unfavorable decision outcomes  citation
MISC	different solutions have been proposed for improving the communication of medical information
MISC	some authors suggest  for example  that numbers should be expressed as frequencies  citation  or  especially for persons with low numeracy  conveyed in graphs  citation
MISC	these so-called pictographs show the number of people affected by a certain medical condition in a larger group of people  citation
MISC	therefore  this type of graph seems to be a promising tool for communicating medical information to persons with low numeracy
MISC	several studies show that pictographs help people with low numeracy understand medical information  citation
MISC	however  although pictographs seem to improve low-numerates' direct understanding of the presented numbers e g   knowledge of how many persons are affected by a certain disease  it is not yet clear how this graph influences low-numerates' risk perception
MISC	the influence of pictographs on risk perception  however  may be crucial because perceiving a risk as either high or low might have a greater impact on behavioral intentions than understanding the numerical information alone  citation
MISC	generally  pictographs seem to evoke lower risk perceptions than other presentation formats such as the paling perspective scale  citation  or numerical frequencies  citation
MISC	unfortunately  it is not possible to decide whether a reported risk perception is the  correct  one  because it is subjective in nature
MISC	to handle this difficulty  one can conduct an experiment to investigate whether different levels of probabilities evoke different levels of perceived risk  citation
MISC	in this approach  participants are faced with either a higher or lower probability  and then estimate their perceived risk
OWNX	we then analyze the extent to which participants confronted with the higher risk perceive the risk as higher than participants confronted with the lower risk
MISC	results of two previous studies following this procedure using pictographs showed that a higher probability did not evoke a higher level of perceived risk than a lower probability  citation
MISC	thus  the type of task used in a study may influence the evaluation of pictographs
AIMX	we therefore conducted three studies to examine the influence of numeracy on people's perceptions and  as a new approach to this question  on people's processing of numerical medical information depicted in pictographs
MISC	numeracy is defined as a person's ability to understand and process numerical concepts  citation
MISC	objective measures assess people's numeracy by letting them solve mathematical tasks  citation
MISC	one problem with using such objective measures in mail-in surveys is that the respondents might use helping devices such as calculators
MISC	this would then bias the resulting numeracy score
MISC	furthermore  respondents might find it annoying to fill in such questionnaires and  thus  might simply avoid them when they have the opportunity to do so  citation
MISC	to cope with this problem  fagerlin and colleagues  citation  developed the subjective numeracy scale  which assesses self-reported numeracy skills
MISC	this measure offers the advantage of shorter administration and less reluctance from participants than objective measures  citation
MISC	on the other hand  this measure relies entirely on self-reported numerical ability and preference
MISC	moreover  although it is positively correlated with objective numeracy  citation   it does not measure exactly the same construct as the direct measurement of mathematical skills in objective numeracy measures
OWNX	in short  the aim of our first study was to examine the influence of subjective numeracy on the perception of cancer screening test results presented in pictographs
OWNX	to reach a deeper understanding into how pictographs might influence risk perception in relation to numeracy  we conducted a second study
OWNX	we thereby directly examined the processing of cancer screening results depicted in pictographs and its association with numeracy
OWNX	finally  in study  number   we explored the role of the sequence of the task numerical understanding first vs risk perception first in the context of risk communication with pictographs and numeracy
MISC	although mechanical turk has recently become popular among social scientists as a source of experimental data  doubts may linger about the quality of data provided by subjects recruited from online labor markets
MISC	mechanical turk started in  number  as a service to  crowd-source  labor intensive tasks and is now being used as a source of subjects for experimental research  citation
OWNX	in section  number   we introduce the main features of mechanical turk and demonstrate that the population of mechanical turk is at least as representative of the u s population as traditional subject pools
OWNX	further  we show that it is shifting to include more international participants
OWNX	in section  number   we review the logic underlying concerns with collecting data using mechanical turk and present the strengths and potentials of mechanical turk relative to other online and offline methods of recruiting subjects
OWNX	in section  number   we present the results of a comparative study involving classic experiments in judgment and decision-making  we found no differences in the magnitude of effects obtained using mechanical turk and using traditional subject pools
MISC	scholars in economics and psychology have created a large literature studying reward  punishment and reciprocity
MISC	labor markets constitute a popular application of this body of work  with particular emphasis on how reciprocity helps regulate workplace relationships where managers are unable to perfectly monitor workers
OWNX	we study how idiosyncratic features of the labor market compared to most scenarios in which reciprocity applies affect the nature of worker reciprocity
OWNX	in particular  we show how having an excess supply of workers simulating unemployment and managers who can observe the reciprocal behavior of workers and hire fire them on that basis simulating the reputational concerns inherent in labor market transactions profoundly alters worker reciprocity
MISC	in the absence of reputational concerns  workers tend to reward kind behavior and punish unkind behavior by managers in approximately equal measure
MISC	in the presence of reputational concerns  workers exhibit a marked increase decrease in the propensity to reward kind punish unkind behavior by managers
OWNX	we demonstrate how this is a consequence of workers and managers responding to changes in the strategic incentives to reward and punish
MISC	as far back as the hammarabian code some  number  years ago  retaliation of some form has served to organize behavior in both market and non-market situations
MISC	perhaps illustrating the importance of revenge most succinctly is the biblical injunction of exodus  number   number - number    life for life  eye for eye  tooth for tooth bruise for bruise 
MISC	for their part  scholars have explored the importance of negative actions alongside their seemingly more benign cousins  positive actions
MISC	this stylized fact is perhaps best illustrated in the words of baumeister et al citation   who provide a broad survey of several areas of study examining positive and negative reciprocity  and conclude that p  number - number   italics added   the breadth and convergence of evidence  however  across different areas were striking  which forms the most important evidence
OWNX	in no area were we able to find a consistent reversal  such that one could draw a firm conclusion that good is stronger than bad
OWNX	this failure to find any substantial contrary patterns occurred despite our own wishes and efforts
OWNX	hence  we must conclude that bad is stronger than good at a pervasive  general level
MISC	 within economics  such results have served as the classic example of loss aversion - that people are more sensitive to negative realizations than to positive realizations of uncertainty  citation  - have played an important role in policymaking  citation   and have informed mechanism design
MISC	in terms of the latter  the principal is confronted with an interesting decision problem if framing of the incentive scheme matters to agent behavior or the number of instruments available to the principal is constrained
MISC	in this manner  choosing between carrots and sticks  for example  plays an important role in the outcome  citation
MISC	more generally  scholars have frequently remarked that loss aversion represents one of the most robust general behavioral patterns in the social sciences  citation
OWNX	in this study  we explore a general  labor-market setting wherein economic theory provides predictions that positive reciprocity should be stronger than negative reciprocity
MISC	under this design  a worker that respects her initial affective reaction and punishes the employer will find herself unemployed
MISC	alternatively  a worker who is nice to the employer will be more likely to be employed in the next period
MISC	on the other hand  if the employer is nice  the worker will reciprocate strongly since in this situation not only is she employed  but also by a nice employer
OWNX	to test our theory  we design a simple controlled laboratory experiment  which yields several insights
MISC	also consonant with the literature is the fact that agents become emotionally charged when treated poorly
MISC	yet  this emotional charge does not readily transfer to actions when realistic institutional features of labor markets are in place
MISC	for example  when agents can form reputations  they respond much more acutely to positive than to negative stimuli
OWNX	the remainder of our study proceeds as follows
OWNX	section  number  contains the experimental design
OWNX	section  number  summarizes the experimental results
MISC	the increasing importance of non-coding rna in biology and medicine has led to a growing interest in the problem of rna 3-d structure prediction.
MISC	as is the case for proteins, rna 3-d structure prediction methods require two key ingredients: an accurate energy function and a conformational sampling procedure.
MISC	both are only partly solved problems.
OWNX	here, we focus on the problem of conformational sampling.
MISC	however, the discrete nature of the fragments necessitates the use of carefully tuned, unphysical energy functions, and their non-probabilistic nature impairs unbiased sampling.
OWNX	we offer a solution to the sampling problem that removes these important limitations: a probabilistic model of rna structure that allows efficient sampling of rna conformations in continuous space, and with associated probabilities.
MISC	non-coding rna is of crucial importance for the functioning of the living cell, where it plays key catalytic, regulatory and structural roles citation, citation.
MISC	in many cases, this understanding requires knowledge of rna structure in atomic detail.
MISC	many noticeable advances have been made in the area of secondary structure prediction; most recently the introduction of statistical sampling had an important impact citation citation .
MISC	in the past years, an increasing number of relevant structures have become available, and much progress has been made in the understanding of the three dimensional structure of rna.
MISC	however, routine prediction of rna 3-d structure still remains an important open problem, and with the growing gap between the number of known sequences and determined structures, the problem is becoming more and more pronounced.
MISC	the two key ingredients in algorithms for rna 3-d structure prediction, namely an accurate energy function and a conformational sampling procedure citation, are both only partly solved problems.
OWNX	here, we focus on the latter problem.
MISC	these methods have led to numerous important breakthroughs in the related fields of protein and rna 3-d structure prediction in the last ten years citation citation.
MISC	one of the problems associated with these methods is that they inherently discretize the continuous conformational space, and hence do not cover all relevant conformations citation.
MISC	this is problematic since the resolution of the conformational search procedure imposes limits on the energy function; the use of fine-grained energy terms requires continuous adjustments to the rna's dihedral degrees of freedom, which fragment assembly methods cannot provide citation.
MISC	in other words, the shortcomings of the conformational sampling method need to be counteracted by tweaking the energy function.
OWNX	for these reasons we have developed a new solution to the conformational sampling problem: a probabilistic model, called barnacle, that describes rna structure in a natural, continuous space.
MISC	barnacle makes it possible to efficiently sample 3-d conformations that are rna-like on a short length scale.
MISC	such a model can be used purely as a proposal distribution, but also as an energy term enforcing realistic local conformations.
MISC	imposing favorable long range interactions, such as hydrogen bonding between the bases, lies outside the scope of such a local model and is the task of a global energy function.
OWNX	barnacle combines a dynamic bayesian network citation, which suits the sequential nature of the rna molecule, with directional statistics, a branch of statistics that is concerned with the representation of angular data.
MISC	these many degrees of freedom combined with the limited number of experimentally determined rna structures citation make this a particularly challenging statistical task for which a very different strategy was required.
OWNX	in particular, the approach we used for proteins would in the case of rna require the use of a probability density function on the 7-dimensional hypertorus, which poses a serious statistical and computational obstacle.
OWNX	below, we describe the probabilistic model in detail, and show that it captures the crucial aspects of local rna structure.
MISC	knowledge of the free energy landscape topology is the essential key to understanding many biochemical processes.
MISC	the determination of the conformers of a protein and their basins of attraction takes a central role for studying molecular isomerization reactions.
OWNX	in this work, we present a novel framework to unveil the features of a free energy landscape answering questions such as how many meta-stable conformers there are, what the hierarchical relationship among them is, or what the structure and kinetics of the transition paths are.
MISC	exploring the landscape by molecular dynamics simulations, the microscopic data of the trajectory are encoded into a conformational markov network.
MISC	the structure of this graph reveals the regions of the conformational space corresponding to the basins of attraction.
MISC	in addition, handling the conformational markov network, relevant kinetic magnitudes as dwell times and rate constants, or hierarchical relationships among basins, completes the global picture of the landscape.
OWNX	we show the power of the analysis studying a toy model of a funnel-like potential and computing efficiently the conformers of a short peptide, dialanine, paving the way to a systematic study of the free energy landscape in large peptides.
MISC	polymers and, more specifically, proteins, show complex behavior at the cellular system level, e.g. in protein-protein interaction networks citation, and also at the individual level, where proteins show a large degree of multistability: a single protein can fold in different conformational states citation citation.
MISC	as a complex system citation, citation, the dynamics of a protein cannot be understood by studying its parts in isolation, instead, the system must be analyzed as a whole.
MISC	tools able to represent and handle the information of the entire picture of a complex system are thus necessary.
MISC	complex network theory citation, citation has proved to be a powerful tool used in seemingly different biologically-related fields such as the study of metabolic reactions, ecological and food webs, genetic regulatory systems and the study of protein dynamics citation.
MISC	in this latter context, diverse studies have analyzed the conformational space of polymers and proteins making use of network representations citation citation, where nodes account of polymer conformations.
MISC	additionally, some studies have tried to determine the common and general properties of these conformational networks citation, citation looking at magnitudes such as clustering coefficient, cyclomatic number, connectivity, etc. recently, trying to decompose the network in modules corresponding to the free energy basins, the use of community algorithms over these conformational networks have been proposed citation.
MISC	markovian state models let us treat the information of one or several trajectories of molecular dynamics as a set of conformations with certain transition probabilities among them citation, citation, citation.
MISC	therefore, the time-continuous trajectory turns into a transition matrix, offering global observables as relaxation times and modes.
MISC	in citation citation the use of markovian models is proposed with the aim of detecting fel meta-stable states.
OWNX	in this article we make a novel study of the fel capturing its mesoscopic structure and hence characterizing conformational states and the transitions between them.
OWNX	we show how to efficiently handle the graph to obtain, through its topology, the main features of the landscape: conformers and their basins of attraction, dwell times, rate constants between the conformational states detected and a coarse-grained picture of the fel.
MISC	the framework is shown and validated analyzing a synthetic funnel-like potential.
MISC	after this, the terminally blocked alanine peptide is studied unveiling the main characteristics of its fel.
MISC	a current challenge is to develop computational approaches to infer gene network regulatory relationships based on multiple types of large-scale functional genomic data.
OWNX	we find that single-layer feed-forward artificial neural network models can effectively discover gene network structure by integrating global in vivo protein:dna interaction data with genome-wide microarray rna data.
OWNX	we test this on the yeast cell cycle transcription network, which is composed of several hundred genes with phase-specific rna outputs.
MISC	comparative analysis of motif occurrences among multiple yeast species independently confirmed relationships inferred from ann weights analysis.
MISC	ann models can capitalize on properties of biological gene networks that other kinds of models do not.
MISC	a prominent feature of cell cycle anns suggested an analogous property might exist in the biological network.
MISC	hundreds of yeast rnas are expressed in a cell cycle dependent, oscillating manner.
MISC	in both budding yeast and fission yeast, these rnas cluster into four or five groups, each corresponding roughly to a phase of the cycle citation citation.
MISC	large sets of phase-specific rnas are also seen in animal and plant cells citation citation, arguing that an extensive cycling transcription network is a fundamental property of eukaryotes.
MISC	the complete composition and connectivity of the cell cycle transcription network is not yet known for any eukaryote, and many components may vary over long evolutionary distances citation citation, citation, but some specific regulators are paneukaryotic, as are some of their direct target genes.
MISC	one way to do this is to integrate multiple genome-wide data types that impinge on connection inference, including factor:dna interaction data from chromatin ip studies, rna expression patterns, and comparative genomic analysis.
MISC	this is appealing partly because these assays are genome-comprehensive and hypothesis-independent, so they can, in principle, reveal regulatory relationships not detected by classical genetics.
MISC	specifics of experimental design and methods of analysis contribute to the wide range in the number of genes designated as cycling, but there is agreement on a core set of nearly 200.
MISC	yeast molecular genetic studies have established that transcriptional regulation is critical for controlling phase-specific rna expression for some of these genes, though this does not exclude modulation and additional contributions from post-transcriptional mechanisms.
MISC	about a dozen saccharomyces transcription factors have been causally associated with direct control of cell cycle expression patterns, including repressors, activators, co-regulators, and regulators that assume both repressing and activating roles, depending on context: ace2, fkh1, fkh2, mbp1, mcm1, ndd1, stb1, swi4, swi5, swi6, yhp1, and yox1.
OWNX	these can serve as internal control true-positive connections.
MISC	a practical consideration is how well the behavior of a network is represented in critical datasets.
MISC	in this case, cells in all cell cycle phases are present in the mixed phase, exponentially growing yeast cultures used for the largest and most complete set of global protein:dna interaction data so far assembled in functional genomics citation.
MISC	these data are further supported by three smaller studies of the same basic design citation citation.
MISC	this sets the cell cycle apart from many other transcription networks whose multiple states are either partly or entirely absent from the global chip data.
MISC	equally important are rna expression data that finely parse the kinetic trajectory for every gene across the cycle of budding yeast citation, citation and also in the distantly related fission yeast, s. pombe citation citation.
MISC	the present work focuses instead on a single cellular process and its underlying gene network, which represents a natural level of organization positioned between the single gene at one extreme and the entire interlocking community of networks that govern the entire cell.
OWNX	to model regulatory factor:target gene behavior, we adapted neural networks to integrate global expression and protein:dna interaction data.
MISC	artificial neural networks are structural computational models with a long history in pattern recognition citation.
MISC	a general reason for thinking anns could be effective for this task is that they have some natural similarities with transcription networks, including the ability to create nonlinear sparse interactions between transcriptional regulators and target genes.
MISC	this is quite different from a world in which binding is reduced to a simple two-state, present/absent call.
MISC	second, anns can give weight and attention to structural features such as the persistent absence of specific factors from particular target groups of genes.
MISC	this negative image information is potentially important and not used by other methods applied to date citation, citation, citation, citation.
MISC	the inherent ability of anns to use these properties is a potential strength compared with algorithms that rest solely on positive evidence of factor:target binding or require discretization of binding measurements into a simplified bound/unbound call.
MISC	in these classical ann applications, the weights within the network are of no particular interest, as long as the trained network performs the desired classification task successfully when extrapolating to new data.
MISC	anns are used here in a substantially different way, serving as structural models citation.
MISC	the resulting ann model is then interrogated to identify the most important regulator-to-target gene associations, as reflected by ann weights.
MISC	ten of the twelve major known transcriptional regulators of cell cycle phase-specific expression ranked at the very top of the 204-regulator list in the model.
MISC	the cell cycle anns were remarkably robust to a series of in silico mutations, in which binding data for a specific factor was eliminated and a new family of ann models were generated.
MISC	additional doubly and triply mutated networks correctly identified epistasis relationships and redundancies in the biological network.
MISC	this approach was also applied to two additional, independent cell cycle expression studies to illustrate generality across data platforms, and to probe how the networks might change under distinct modes of cell synchronization.
MISC	this led us to ask if there is a corresponding bias in the biological network against binding sites for specific factors in some expression families as suggested by the ann.
OWNX	we found that this is the case, in multiple sensu stricto yeast genomes relatively closely related to saccharomyces cerevisiae, and also in the distantly related fission yeast s. pombe.
MISC	this appears to be a deeply conserved network architecture property, even though very few specific orthologous genes are involved.
MISC	furthermore, a key advantage of this pseudo-stoichiometric matrix formalism is its ability to easily integrate with existing stoichiometric matrix representations of signaling and metabolic networks.
OWNX	we analyze the fundamental subspaces of the regulatory network matrix to describe intrinsic properties of the trs.
OWNX	finally, we present novel in silico findings for the e. coli trs, including a gene expression correlation matrix delineating functional motifs; sets of gene ontologies for which regulatory rules governing gene transcription are poorly understood and which may direct further experimental characterization; and the appearance of a distributed trn structure, which is in stark contrast to the more hierarchical organization of metabolic networks.
MISC	complex regulatory networks control the transcription state of a genome and consequently the functional activity of a cell citation.
MISC	even relatively simple unicellular organisms have evolved complicated networks of regulatory interactions, termed transcriptional regulatory networks, to respond to environmental stimuli citation, citation.
MISC	external signals known to impact transcription in microorganisms include carbon source, amino acid, and electron acceptor availability, ph level, and heat and cold stress citation citation.
MISC	mapping the links between these environmental growth conditions through signaling networks and ultimately to the resulting transcriptional response is of primary interest in the study of cellular systems citation.
MISC	consequently, reconstructions of the trns of model organisms are underway citation .
MISC	to effectively describe the interconnected functions of the regulated genes and associated regulatory proteins within a given trn, we recently developed a formalism involving a regulatory network matrix called r citation.
OWNX	we illustrated how, by using the fundamental properties of linear algebra, this matrix formalism allows characterization of trs properties and facilitates in silico prediction of the transcription state of the genome under any specified set of environmental conditions.
MISC	in this way, the r matrix extends previous approaches for characterizing features of trns, including boolean networks citation, citation citation, bayesian networks citation, and stochastic equations citation.
OWNX	by representing the regulatory rules in matrix form, we can characterize the fundamental subspaces of the matrix, which in turn uniquely represent properties of the trs that the r matrix contains.
MISC	furthermore, by using a pseudo-stoichiometric approach as discussed below, the r matrix representation of a trn is consistent with, and thus easily integratable with, related approaches using stoichiometric matrices to computationally represent the reactions underlying metabolic and signaling networks citation citation .
MISC	to date, this approach for representing and analyzing trss has only been applied to relatively small systems, including the well-studied four-gene lac operon in escherichia coli as well as a small 25-gene prototypic trs citation.
MISC	although these model systems have been useful for prototyping studies of the capabilities and behavior of the r matrix, a key unanswered question is how this approach scales to larger, more complex biological systems.
OWNX	here we present first steps toward this end by assembling the r matrix for the genome-scale e. coli trn, for which regulatory relationships have been previously characterized citation and extensive experimental data are available citation, citation.
OWNX	to our knowledge, the work that we present here represents the first r matrix-based model of a genome-scale trs, and this work has enabled us to gain important insights into the behavior of the r matrix at a larger scale, challenges associated with the scale-up, as well as the underlying biology of e. coli transcriptional regulation.
OWNX	specifically, we derived r directly from a previously developed genome-scale model of e. coli in which transcriptional regulatory rules were overlaid on a constraint-based model of metabolism citation.
OWNX	to validate our r matrix analysis, we compared the expression states that we predicted for various environmental growth conditions with available gene expression data.
OWNX	we also explored the fundamental subspaces of a related matrix r representing the complete e. coli trs to describe key systemic properties, including new hypotheses about network structure.
MISC	the process of assigning a finite set of tags or labels to a collection of observations, subject to side conditions, is notable for its computational complexity.
MISC	this labeling paradigm is of theoretical and practical relevance to a wide range of biological applications, including the analysis of data from dna microarrays, metabolomics experiments, and biomolecular nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
OWNX	we present a novel algorithm, called probabilistic interaction network of evidence, that achieves robust, unsupervised probabilistic labeling of data.
OWNX	the computational core of pine uses estimates of evidence derived from empirical distributions of previously observed data, along with consistency measures, to drive a fictitious system m with hamiltonian h to a quasi-stationary state that produces probabilistic label assignments for relevant subsets of the data.
OWNX	we demonstrate the successful application of pine to a key task in protein nmr spectroscopy: that of converting peak lists extracted from various nmr experiments into assignments associated with probabilities for their correctness.
OWNX	the pine-nmr server accepts as input the sequence of the protein plus user-specified combinations of data corresponding to an extensive list of nmr experiments; it provides as output a probabilistic assignment of nmr signals to sequence-specific backbone and aliphatic side chain atoms plus a probabilistic determination of the protein secondary structure.
OWNX	pine-nmr can accommodate prior information about assignments or stable isotope labeling schemes.
MISC	pine-nmr achieves robust and consistent results that have been shown to be effective in subsequent steps of nmr structure determination.
MISC	this family includes clustering and dimensionality reduction, an approach in which the original dataset is represented by a set of typically far lower dimension.
MISC	the representative set, often the parameter vector that signifies a set of data points, can be simply the cluster mean or may include additional parameters, such as the cluster diameter.
MISC	the labeling problem is important, because it is encountered in many applications involving data analysis, particularly where prior knowledge of the probability distributions is incomplete or lacking.
MISC	a challenging instance of the labeling problem arises naturally in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which along with x-ray crystallography is one of the two major methods for determining protein structures.
MISC	although nmr spectroscopy is not as highly automated as the more mature x-ray field, it has advantages over x-ray crystallography for structural studies of small proteins that are partially disordered, exist in multiple stable conformations in solution, exhibit weak interactions with ligands, or fail to crystallize readily citation, provided that the nmr signals can be assigned to specific atoms in the covalent structure of the protein.
MISC	the labeling problem known as the assignment problem, has been one of the major bottlenecks in protein nmr spectroscopy.
MISC	protein nmr structure determination generally proceeds through a series of steps.
OWNX	the usual approach is first to collect data used in determining backbone and aliphatic side chain assignments.
OWNX	these assignments are then used to interpret data collected in order to determine interatomic or torsion angular constraints used in structure determination.
MISC	the front-end labeling process associates one or more nmr parameters with a physical entity ; the back-end labeling process associates nmr parameters with constraints that define or refine conformational states.
MISC	in reality, the distinction between front-end and back-end is artificial.
MISC	in addition, as demonstrated recently, structures of small proteins can be determined directly from assigned chemical shifts by a process that largely bypasses the back-end citation, citation.
OWNX	ideally, all available data should be used in a unified process that yields the best set of assignments and best structure consistent with experiment and with a probabilistic analysis that provides levels of confidence in the assignments and atomic coordinates.
MISC	the usual approach to the solution of the problem of assigning labels to subsets of peaks assembled from multiple sets of noisy spectra is to collect a number of multidimensional, multinuclear datasets.
MISC	after converting the time domain data to frequency domain spectra by fourier transformation, peaks are picked from each spectrum for analysis.
MISC	methods have been developed for automated peak picking or global analysis of spectra to yield models consisting of peaks with known intensity, frequency, phase, and decay rate or linewidth citation, citation.
MISC	in the ideal case, the resulting peak-lists identify combinatorial subsets of two or more covalently bonded nuclei by their respective frequencies.
MISC	these subsets must be assembled in a coherent way to best correspond to specific atoms in the amino acid sequence of the protein.
MISC	in practice, peak lists do not report on all nuclei, and noise peaks are commonplace.
MISC	a common feature among prior approaches has been to divide the assignment of labels into a sequence of discrete steps and to apply varying methods at each step.
MISC	these steps typically include an assignment step citation citation, a secondary structure determination step citation citation, and a validation step citation.
MISC	the validation step, in which a discrete reliability measure indicates the possible presence of outliers, misassignments, or abnormal backbone chemical shift values, is sometimes omitted.
MISC	other steps can be added, or steps can be split further into simpler tasks.
MISC	the specification of conformational states can be added as yet another labeling step.
MISC	the nmr assignment problem has been highly researched, and is most naturally formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem, which can be subsequently solved using a variety of algorithms.
MISC	a 2004 review listed on the order of 100 algorithms and software packages citation, and additional approaches are given in a 2008 review citation.
MISC	of these, the most established, as judged from bmrb entries that cite the assignment software packages used, are autoassign citation and garant citation .
MISC	similarly, a wide range of methods have been used to predict the protein secondary structural elements that play an important role in classifying proteins citation, citation.
OWNX	prior approaches to assigning a secondary structure label to each residue of the protein have included the method citation, the chemical shift index method citation, a database approach citation, an empirical probability-based method citation, a supervised machine learning approach citation, and a probabilistic approach that utilizes a local statistical potential to combine predictive potentials derived from the sequence and chemical shifts citation.
OWNX	the flya approach demonstrates the benefits of making use of information from each step in an iterative fashion to achieve a high number of backbone and side chain assignments.
OWNX	we reformulate the combinatorial optimization problem whereby each labeling configuration in the ensemble has an associated but unknown non-vanishing probability.
OWNX	the pine algorithm enables full integration of information from disparate steps to achieve a probabilistic analysis.
MISC	the use of probabilities provides the means for sharing and refining incomplete information among the current standard steps, or steps introduced by future developments.
OWNX	in addition, probabilistic analysis deals directly with the multiple minima problem that arises in cases where the data does not support a single optimal and self-consistent state.
MISC	a common example is a protein that populates two stable conformational states.
OWNX	the pine-nmr package described here represents a first step in approaching the goal of a full probabilistic approach to protein nmr spectroscopy.
MISC	pine-nmr accepts as input the sequence of the protein plus peak lists derived from one or more nmr experiments chosen by the user from an extensive list of possibilities.
OWNX	pine-nmr provides as output a probabilistic assignment of backbone and aliphatic side chain chemical shifts and the secondary structure of the protein.
OWNX	at the same time, it identifies, verifies, and, if needed, rectifies, problems related to chemical shift referencing or the consistency of assignments with determined secondary structure.
MISC	such extensions should lead to a rapid and fully automated approach to nmr structure determination that would yield the structure most consistent with all available data and with confidence limits on atom positions explicitly represented.
MISC	in addition to its application to nmr spectroscopy, the pine approach should be applicable to the unbiased classification of biological data in other domains of interest, such as systems biology, in which data of various types need to be integrated: genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data collected as a function of time and environmental variables.
MISC	trans/cis prolyl isomerisation is involved in several biological processes, including the development of numerous diseases.
OWNX	our results allow us to propose a novel mechanistic hypothesis, which is finally consistent with all of the available molecular biology data.
MISC	proline trans/cis isomerization takes part in several fundamental biological processes, including protein folding citation citation, immune response citation, citation, ion channel gating citation and cellular signalling citation, citation, citation.
MISC	the process, which is also associated to the development of a variety of diseases including hiv-1 infection citation, citation, carcinogenesis citation and alzheimer's citation, is catalyzed by prolyl isomerase enzymes citation, citation, citation .
MISC	the best characterized isomerization in vivo and in vitro occurs in the uncoating and recruitment of the human hiv-1 capsid protein in the virions citation, and it is catalyzed by cyclophilin a isomerase.
OWNX	at the structural level, cypa features -helices flanking a beta-barrel, while ca is made of several -helices connected by loops.
MISC	in the x-ray structure of the complex citation, the targeted proline-containing backbone unit, is accommodated in a hydrophobic pocket of cypa.
MISC	although the backbone unit is in trans conformation in the x-ray structure citation, nmr studies have shown that 45 percent of conformers are cis for ca-cypa r55a in aqueous solution citation.
MISC	the rather significant population of cis conformers could arise not only by the replacement of r55 with ala, but also by crystal packing forces, different temperature conditions, along with different hydration and ionic strength in the two experiments.
MISC	in addition, they suggest that h-bonding between the backbone unit of the targeted glycine-proline peptidyl bond and that of n102@cypa citation, citation, citation, as well as van der waals interactions between substrate and the cypa hydrophobic pocket stabilize the transition state citation, citation, citation.
MISC	these hypotheses are consistent with the decrease of k cat/k m associated with the polymorphism of cyclophilins in 102 position and in the f60a, f113a and h126q cypa mutants citation, citation.
MISC	nmr studies, along with computations, have further suggested that the motions of several cypa residues are linked to the enzymatic activity citation, citation citation.
MISC	free energy calculations characterized a network of protein vibrations in cypa that are associated with its isomerase activity: flexible loops on the surface are connected to the active site by a network of hydrogen bonds citation, citation, citation .
MISC	in spite of the great progress in describing the catalytic process, key mechanistic issues need to be addressed.
MISC	kinetic studies citation suggested that the overall process involves trans and cis forms in solution and in complex with the protein.
MISC	however, the studies so far consider mostly ts stabilization.
MISC	these studies show that residues not involved in ts stabilization in the proposed mechanisms are important for the function, as their mutations cause a decrease of k cat/k m. indeed, k cat/k m passes from 1.6 10 7 m 1 s 1 in the wild type to 1.6 10 4 m 1 s 1 by mutating the fully conserved r55 residue with ala citation.
MISC	although this mutation was proposed originally to destroy an h-bond stabilizing uniquely the ts citation, citation, such h-bond was subsequently ruled out in computational works citation, citation, citation and so far no functional role has been ascribed to r55.
MISC	in addition, the h54q mutation, along with the i57v polymorphism, causes a decrease of k cat/k m, although these residues are not involved in ts stabilization .
OWNX	we calculate the free energy associated with the isomerisation of the 6 aminoacids long substrate fragment in water and in complex with cypa.
OWNX	we use here metadynamics citation, which has already been employed to predict the energetics of protein/peptide interactions citation.
MISC	the potential used is an effective one.
MISC	this choice allows a very efficient sampling because of its relatively small computational cost.
OWNX	the accuracy of the force field for minima and transition states is assessed by comparing our results with first principle quantum chemistry calculations.
MISC	the enzyme turns out to dramatically stabilize the populations of one specific cis conformer relative to the trans ones, which instead are by far the most stable in aqueous solution.
MISC	in addition, it lowers the free energy barrier of a specific, one way isomerization from trans to cis.
OWNX	we perform a large-scale study of intrinsically disordered regions in proteins and protein complexes using a non-redundant set of hundreds of different protein complexes.
MISC	moreover, analysis of disorder in protein complexes depicts a significant fraction of intrinsically disordered regions, with up to one third of all residues being disordered.
OWNX	we find that the disorder in homodimers, especially in symmetrical homodimers, is significantly higher than in heterodimers and offer an explanation for this interesting phenomenon.
MISC	intrinsically disordered proteins have been found in a wide scope of organisms and their disorder content was shown to increase with organism complexity citation citation.
MISC	idps have certain properties and functions that distinguish them from proteins with well-defined structures.
MISC	idps have no unique three-dimensional structure in an isolated state but can fold upon binding to their interaction partners citation, citation, citation citation.
MISC	conformational changes upon binding in proteins with unstructured regions are much larger than those in structured proteins citation.
MISC	the conformations of disordered regions in a protein complex are determined not only by the amino acid sequences but also by the interacting partners citation, citation.
MISC	idps can have many different functions and can bind to many different partners using the same or different interfaces citation.
MISC	idps can accommodate larger interfaces on smaller scaffolds compared to proteins with well-defined structure citation, citation, citation.
MISC	idps typically have an amino acid composition of low aromatic content and high net charge as well as low sequence complexity and high flexibility citation, citation, citation.
MISC	intrinsic disorder provides for a rapid degradation of unfolded proteins, thereby enabling a rapid response to changes in protein concentration citation.
MISC	predictions of disorder in proteins take into account the characteristic features of unstructured proteins and have been shown to be rather successful, especially in the case of large regions.
MISC	according to the results of casp7, the best prediction groups successfully identified 50 70 percent of the disordered residues with false positive rates from 3 percent to 16 percent citation.
MISC	prediction methods aim to identify disordered regions through the analysis of amino acid sequences using mainly the physico-chemical properties of the amino acids citation, citation citation or evolutionary conservation citation, citation citation .
MISC	as protein interactions are crucial for protein function, the biological role of disordered proteins should also be studied in this context.
MISC	indeed, folding of disordered proteins into ordered structures may occur upon binding to their specific partners citation, citation, citation citation which may allow disordered regions to structurally accommodate multiple interaction partners with high specificity and low affinity citation, citation citation.
MISC	moreover, it has been shown that the binding mechanism, whether binding occurs between folded or unfolded chains, depends on the structural characteristics, interface properties, and degree of minimal frustration of monomers citation, citation.
MISC	binding through unfolded or partially unfolded intermediates can provide a kinetic advantage through the fly-casting mechanism citation.
MISC	according to this mechanism a dimensionality reduction occurs when the folding of a disordered protein is coupled with binding, thereby speeding up the search for specific targets.
MISC	a database of continuous protein fragments has been compiled from the protein data bank to include short protein chains bound to larger proteins citation, citation.
MISC	it has been argued that morfs participate in the coupling of binding and folding, a hypothesis that was supported by the analysis of the composition and predicted disorder of morf segments.
MISC	as a result of studying the subtle structural differences of the same proteins in different conditions and functional states, many so-called dual personality protein segments were found able to exist in both ordered and disordered states citation.
MISC	there is a continuous range between completely structured and completely disordered proteins in which intermediate cases are rather common citation : proteins that are disordered but compact, multi-domain proteins with disordered linkers, and ordered proteins with some local disorder.
MISC	nevertheless, the universality of this phenomenon and functional importance of many disordered regions remains unclear.
MISC	the atomic details of structures and the conserved binding mode analysis introduced earlier citation allow us to monitor changes happening on or near interaction interfaces and to infer their functional importance.
MISC	hsp90 is a molecular chaperone essential for protein folding and activation in normal homeostasis and stress response.
MISC	atp binding and hydrolysis facilitate hsp90 conformational changes required for client activation.
MISC	hsp90 plays an important role in disease states, particularly in cancer, where chaperoning of the mutated and overexpressed oncoproteins is important for function.
MISC	recent studies have illuminated mechanisms related to the chaperone function.
OWNX	here, we present a computational analysis of signal propagation and long-range communication pathways in hsp90.
OWNX	we carried out molecular dynamics simulations of the full-length hsp90 dimer, combined with essential dynamics, correlation analysis, and a signal propagation model.
MISC	all-atom md simulations with timescales of 70 ns have been performed for complexes with the natural substrates atp and adp and for the unliganded dimer.
OWNX	we elucidate the mechanisms of signal propagation and determine hot spots involved in interdomain communication pathways from the nucleotide-binding site to the c-terminal domain interface.
OWNX	a comprehensive computational analysis of the hsp90 communication pathways and dynamics at atomic resolution has revealed the role of the nucleotide in effecting conformational changes, elucidating the mechanisms of signal propagation.
MISC	functionally important residues and secondary structure elements emerge as effective mediators of communication between the nucleotide-binding site and the c-terminal interface.
OWNX	furthermore, we show that specific interdomain signal propagation pathways may be activated as a function of the ligand.
MISC	heat shock protein 90 is an essential atpase directed molecular chaperone required for folding quality control, maturation and trafficking of client proteins citation citation.
MISC	hsp90 represents a fundamental hub in protein interaction networks citation, citation, with key roles in many cellular functions.
MISC	hsp90 oversees the correct maturation, activation and trafficking among specialized cellular compartments citation of a wide range of client proteins citation, citation, citation.
MISC	the functions of clients range from signal transduction to regulatory mechanisms and immune response citation.
MISC	client proteins typically include numerous kinases, transcription factors and other proteins that serve as nodal points in integrating cellular responses to multiple signals citation.
MISC	because of this role in disease development, pharmacological suppression of hsp90 activity has become an area of very intense research, in molecular oncology in particular.
MISC	the crystal structures of larger constructs have also been reported citation, citation.
MISC	the first x-ray crystal structures of full-length hsp90 from yeast bound to the atp mimic amppnp revealed a homodimeric structure in which the individual protomers have a twisted parallel arrangement citation.
MISC	each protomer, in turn, is characterized by a modular architecture with three well-defined domains: an n-terminal regulatory domain, responsible for atp binding, a middle domain, which completes the atpase site necessary for atp hydrolysis and binds client proteins, and a c-terminal dimerization domain which is required for dimerization citation.
MISC	the same global topology is shared by the atp-bound states of the e.coli homolog htpg citation and by the endoplasmatic reticulum paralog grp94 citation.
MISC	more recent solution structure data obtained using saxs, single particle cryo-electron microscopy and modeling approaches showed that the apo-hsp90 dimer may be in equilibrium among different open, extended states, still preserving the constitutive dimerization provided by the ctds, and that nucleotide binding may shift this equilibrium towards compact conformations citation citation.
MISC	in particular, saxs data have revealed that the adp-bound compact state of htpg can be in equilibrium with an extended state, which could be significantly populated in the absence of crystal packing effects citation.
MISC	in contrast, crystal structures of amppnp and adp-bound forms of the er-paralog grp94 showed that there is relatively little difference in conformation between the two nucleotide bound states in the crystal citation, representing extended structures.
MISC	these studies have indicated that upon binding to a specific partner, functional states of hsp90 can be recruited using the intrinsic conformational flexibility of hsp90.
OWNX	the crystal structures of the full-length dimer also highlight the remarkable flexibility of the atp-lid, a segment composed of two helices and the intervening loop located immediately adjacent to the atp binding site citation.
MISC	these studies are reminiscent of the results from an h/d exchange mass spectrometry investigations on the human hsp90 in solution, which showed that the co-chaperone and inhibitor binding to the ntd can induce conformational changes at the hsp90 domain-domain interfaces citation.
MISC	moreover, frey and coworkers citation have shown that kinetic and equilibrium binding constants depend on the intrinsic conformational equilibrium of the hsp90 obtained from different species, reflecting differential affinity and reactivity towards atp.
MISC	the kinetic analysis of the atpase cycle has suggested that during the atpase cycle grp94 may be predominantly in the open state.
MISC	in contrast in the yeast hsp90 the open state is only populated to 20 percent and a closed structure is observed in the presence of nucleotides citation.
MISC	hence, conformational transitions during the atpase cycle are structurally similar for different hsp90 proteins, while the energetic balance between individual steps may be species-dependent, which is manifested in differences in the binding kinetics citation.
MISC	the most recent structural studies of the apo and nucleotide-bound conformations of the e. coli, yeast, and human hsp90 homologs have further supported the existence of a universal three-state conformational cycle for hsp90, consisting of open-apo, atp-closed and adp-compact nucleotide-stabilized states, whereby the intrinsic conformational equilibrium between these states can be highly-species dependent citation.
MISC	according to these results, the evolutionary pressure may act through thermodynamic stabilization of the functionally relevant hsp90 conformations recruited from the conformational equilibrium, to ensure the adequate response to the presence of organism-specific co-chaperones and protein clients.
MISC	importantly, atp or adp binding can shift the conformational equilibrium far away from the apo state for e. coli and yeast hsp90, whereas the conformational equilibrium for human hsp90 is largely dominated by the open form, even in the presence of the nucleotide binding.
MISC	overall, the intrinsic conformational flexibility of hsp90 is critical to the molecular chaperon cycle, including structural adaptation to diversity of co-chaperones and client proteins citation.
MISC	different steps in the cycle are accompanied by binding to different co-chaperone proteins with specific functions.
MISC	the hop co-chaperone, for instance, arrests atp hydrolysis and binds simultaneously to the hsp70 molecular chaperone, coupling the two systems.
MISC	the hop binding to hsp90 involves interactions at both m-domains and ctd domains citation, citation stabilizing a conformation that is incompetent for atp hydrolysis and n-terminal dimerization citation.
MISC	in contrast, the stress-regulated co-chaperone aha1 substantially increases atpase rates increasing hsp90 chaperone activities citation.
MISC	in the case of binding to other co-chaperones, cpr6 and sba1, it was shown that atp-binding and hydrolysis is required to ensure productive complex formation: interestingly, sba1 binds to the ntd while cpr6 binds to the ctd citation.
MISC	these observations suggest a role for the nucleotide in selecting and stabilizing different conformations of hsp90, related to specific different functions in the chaperone cycle citation .
MISC	however, there are still a number of important unresolved problems concerning the atomic resolution understanding of the interplay between ligand binding and the global functional motions of the molecular chaperone.
MISC	these simulations have clarified the role of atp-lid dynamics, differences in local conformational changes and global flexibility, as well as the functional interplay between protein rigidity and entropy of collective motions depending on the interacting binding partners.
MISC	according to this model, structural plasticity of the hsp90 ntd can be exploited by the molecular chaperone machinery to modulate enhanced structural rigidity during atp binding and increased protein flexibility as a consequence of the inhibitor binding.
MISC	citation .
OWNX	the molecular basis of signal propagation mechanisms and inter-domain communication pathways in the hsp90 as a function of binding ligands cannot be inferred directly from crystallographic studies.
OWNX	as a result, computational approaches are instrumental in revealing the atomic details of inter-domain communication pathways between the nucleotide binding site and distant ctd, which may be involved in governing the chaperone equilibrium between major conformational states.
OWNX	in this work, we have embarked on a comprehensive computational analysis of hsp90 dynamics and binding which provides important insights into our understanding of the hsp90 molecular mechanisms and function at atomic resolution.
OWNX	these results of our study suggest that the low-resolution features of communication pathways in the hsp90 complexes may be determined by the inherent topological architecture of the chaperone, yet specific signal communication pathways are likely to be selected and activated based on the nature of the binding partner.
MISC	time-dependent population firing rates for granular, supragranular, and infragranular populations in a barrel column and the thalamic population in the homologous barreloid are extracted from the high-frequency portion of the recorded extracellular signals.
MISC	the extracted firing rates of the various cortical laminar populations are found to exhibit strong temporal correlations for the present experimental paradigm, and simple feedforward population firing-rate models combined with linear or mixed linear-parabolic activation function are found to provide excellent fits to the data.
MISC	the identified thalamocortical and intracortical network models are thus found to be qualitatively very different.
MISC	while the thalamocortical circuit is optimally stimulated by rapid changes in the thalamic firing rate, the intracortical circuits are low-pass and respond most strongly to slowly varying inputs from the cortical layer-4 population.
MISC	some firing-rate network models, in particular for the early visual system, have been developed to account for particular physiological data.
MISC	however, for strongly interconnected cortical networks, few mechanistic network models directly accounting for specific neurobiological data have been identified.
MISC	instead most work has been done on generic network models and has focused on the investigation of generic features, such as the generation and stability of localized bumps, oscillatory patterns, traveling waves and pulses and other coherent structures, for reviews see ermentrout citation or coombes citation .
OWNX	our study reveals large differences in the transfer function between thalamus and layer 4 of the barrel column, compared to that between cortical layers, and thus sheds direct light on how whisker stimuli is encoded in population firing-activity in the somatosensory system.
MISC	the derivation of biologically realistic, cortical neural-network models has generally been hampered by the lack of relevant experimental data to constrain and test the models.
MISC	single electrodes can generally only measure the firing activity of individual neurons, not the joint activity of populations of cells typically predicted by population firing-rate models.
MISC	kyriazi and simons citation and pinto et al. citation, citation thus developed models for the somatosensory thalamocortical signal transformation based on pooled data from single-unit recordings from numerous animals.
MISC	by contrast, multielectrode arrays provide a convenient and powerful technology for obtaining simultaneous recordings from all layers of the cerebral cortex, at one or more cortical locations citation.
MISC	with so called laminar population analysis einevoll et al. citation jointly modeled the low-frequency and high-frequency parts of such stimulus-evoked laminar electrode data to estimate the laminar organization of cortical populations in a barrel column, time-dependent population firing rates, and the lfp signatures following firing in a particular population.
OWNX	here we use the stimulus-evoked time-dependent firing rates for the cortical populations estimated using lpa, in combination with single-electrode recordings of the firing activity in the homologous barreloid in vpm, to identify population firing-rate models.
MISC	the models are formulated as nonlinear volterra integral equations with exponentially decaying coupling kernels allowing for a mapping of the systems to sets of differential equations, the more common mathematical representation of firing-rate models citation, citation .
MISC	the population responses were found to increase monotonically both with increasing amplitude and velocity of the whisker flick citation, citation, citation.
MISC	a stimulus set varying both the whisker-flicking amplitude and the rise time was found to provide a rich variety of thalamic and cortical responses and thus to be well suited for distinguishing between candidate models.
OWNX	for this thalamocortical transfer our experimental data favors a model with fast feedforward excitation, a slower predominantly inhibitory process mediated by a combination of recurrent and feedforward interactions, and a mixed linear-parabolic activation function.
MISC	the identified thalamocortical circuits are seen to have a band-pass property, and in the frequency domain the largest responses for the layer-4 population is obtained for thalamic firing rates with frequencies around twenty hz.
MISC	very different population firing-rate models are identified for the intracortical circuits, i.e., the spread of population activity from layer 4 to supragranular and infragranular layers.
MISC	for the present experimental paradigm the extracted firing rates of the various cortical laminar populations are found to exhibit strong temporal correlations and simple feedforward models with linear or mixed linear-parabolic activation function are found to account excellently for the data.
MISC	the functional properties of the identified thalamocortical and intracortical network models are thus qualitatively very different: while the thalamocortical circuit is optimally stimulated by rapid changes in the thalamic firing rate, the intracortical circuits are low-pass and respond strongest to slowly varying inputs.
MISC	many important protein protein interactions are mediated by the binding of a short peptide stretch in one protein to a large globular segment in another.
MISC	recent efforts have provided hundreds of examples of new peptides binding to proteins for which a three-dimensional structure is available but where no structure of the protein peptide complex is known.
MISC	for peptides known to bind a particular protein, the method predicts binding sites with great accuracy, and the specificity of the approach means that it can also be used to predict whether or not a putative or predicted peptide partner will bind.
MISC	the method performed well in a benchmark and largely agreed with experimental data mapping binding sites for several recently discovered interactions mediated by peptides, including rg-rich proteins with smn domains, epstein-barr virus lmp1 with tradd domains, dbc1 with sir2, and the ago hook with argonaute piwi domain.
MISC	these interactions can vary substantially in how they are mediated.
MISC	what perhaps most often comes to mind are interactions involving large interfaces, such as those inside the hemoglobin tetramer, however, many important protein interactions, particularly those that are transient, low-affinity or related to post-translational modification events like phosphorylation, are mediated by the binding of a globular domain in one protein to a short peptide stretch in another citation.
MISC	peptide regions binding to a common protein, or domain, often conform to a sequence pattern, or linear motif that captures the key features of binding citation.
MISC	for instance, sh3 domains bind pxxp motifs, ww domains bind ppxy or pplp motifs, and sh2, 14-3-3 and ptb domains bind phosphorylated peptides citation.
MISC	since they are generally held to be more chemically tractable than interactions involving larger interfaces, protein peptide interactions also represent an important new class of drug targets, and there are a growing number of small molecules that are designed to target them citation .
MISC	the discovery of new peptides and motifs mediating interactions has been of intense interest in recent years.
MISC	several techniques have been developed to uncover new variants of peptides that bind to known partners.
MISC	for instance, phage display and peptide array technologies have been applied to uncover new peptide partners for many proteins or domains, including sh3 citation, ww citation and pdz citation domains.
MISC	the common thread to all of these approaches is that they rely on prior knowledge of the type of peptide binding to a domain and often require further knowledge of the peptide binding site on the globular protein.
MISC	they are thus generally only effective for finding new variants of known peptides, and cannot directly uncover new protein peptide interaction types.
CONT	protein protein docking is currently the only widely used technique that can be applied to this problem generally, however this approach has limited application for peptides longer than 4 residues largely owing to the high degree of flexibility that one must consider when docking a typical peptide of 5 10 residues or the need for a known peptide conformation which is only rarely available citation.
MISC	moreover, docking methods are very sensitive to conformational changes and require very high-resolution structures to perform well.
MISC	determining new protein peptide interaction types is problematic experimentally, mostly because it is difficult in advance to know the regions in larger proteins responsible for binding, necessitating painstaking experiments such as deletion mutagenesis coupled to binding assays.
MISC	to address this, several computational methods have been developed to discover new protein peptide-motif pairs using the principle of sequence over-representation in proteins with a common interacting partner citation citation.
MISC	these methods, together with much conventional work focused on understanding interactions, have identified or predicted hundreds of new peptide-motifs mediating interactions with particular protein domain families.
MISC	however, these discoveries rarely provide information about where the peptide binds the protein.
MISC	there is thus a widening gap between proteins of known structure that are known or predicted to bind to a particular peptide and available 3d complexes that would foster a deeper understanding of mechanism and afford the discovery of additional peptides.
OWNX	here we present a method that attempts to bridge this gap by predicting the binding site for peptides on protein surfaces.
MISC	three dimensional position specific scoring matrices have been used in the past to predict protein folding citation, to assess the quality of structural models citation or to predict the function of proteins based on the matches of these position specific scoring matrices to a new protein structure citation and to identify protein surface similarities citation.
OWNX	we developed statistics to determine the confidence of a prediction to estimate whether or not a putative peptide binds.
MISC	the determination of factors that influence protein conformational changes is very important for the identification of potentially amyloidogenic and disordered regions in polypeptide chains.
OWNX	in our work we introduce a new parameter, mean packing density, to detect both amyloidogenic and disordered regions in a protein sequence.
MISC	it has been shown that regions with strong expected packing density are responsible for amyloid formation.
OWNX	our findings support the concept that the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation is similar for different peptides and proteins.
OWNX	moreover, we have demonstrated that regions with weak expected packing density are responsible for the appearance of disordered regions.
OWNX	thus, we demonstrate that the expected packing density is a useful value with which one can predict both intrinsically disordered and amyloidogenic regions of a protein based on sequence alone.
OWNX	our results are important for understanding the structural characteristics of protein folding and misfolding.
MISC	amyloid fibril formation is associated with an increase of structure content, which leads to fibrillar aggregation citation.
MISC	however, it should be noted that an increased level of the beta structure is a characteristic property of several different types of protein aggregates citation, citation.
MISC	in addition to proteins observed in amyloid diseases, recent studies have shown that diverse proteins not related to any amyloid disease can aggregate into fibrils under destabilizing conditions citation citation.
MISC	normal proteins can become toxic when they undergo fibrillation citation.
MISC	there is no consensus about toxicity of the different states: small oligomers, large oligomers, protofilaments, protofibrils, filaments, mature fibrils, or amorphous aggregates.
MISC	significant advancements in recent research have led to the discovery that the toxic species in the amyloid diseases may not be the fibrils themselves, but rather the pre-fibrillar aggregates citation.
MISC	a possible mechanism for toxicity of -synuclein protofibrils has been demonstrated citation.
MISC	it has been shown that protofibrils can form elliptical pores, like bacterial toxins, which can puncture cell membranes, resulting in cell death citation.
MISC	therefore, the mechanism of amyloid formation is under intensive investigation.
MISC	recognition of the factors that influence protein conformational changes and misfolding is one of the general fundamental problems, the solution to which will help us find effective treatments for amyloid illnesses.
MISC	the experimental observation that not all proteins are amyloidogenic and that specific continuous regions of amyloid-forming proteins are more amyloidogenic than others suggests that there is a sequence propensity for amyloid formation.
MISC	moreover, the observation that some short peptides also can form amyloids implies that these segments, which usually are exposed to the environment, can nucleate the transition of native proteins into the amyloid state, and suggests that fibril formation is sequence-specific citation.
MISC	in the mechanism of amyloidogenesis for natively folded proteins such as 2-microglobulin and transthyretin, the partial unfolding observed is believed to be a prerequisite for the proteins' assembly into amyloid fibrils both in vitro and in vivo citation.
MISC	it has been suggested that residues with enhanced flexibility and solvent accessibility are important for the initiation of fibrillation citation.
MISC	thus, to understand the molecular mechanism of amyloidosis, it is necessary to find factors that induce partial unfolding of proteins and subsequent amyloid fibril formation at or near physiological conditions.
MISC	some intrinsically disordered proteins are involved in amyloid diseases.
MISC	this fact may indicate that disorder is a necessary condition for aggregation.
MISC	it has been shown that a very small change in the environment of such proteins often might cause their partial folding and aggregation citation.
MISC	knowledge of characteristics that control the process of amyloid fibril formation is important for finding effective drugs for treatment of amyloid diseases.
MISC	uversky and fink in their review citation illustrate that protein fibrillogenesis requires a partially folded conformation .
MISC	the first high-resolution crystal of an amyloid fiber formed by a sequence-designed polypeptide has been obtained citation.
MISC	recently, the atomic structure of the cross- spine citation for a seven-residue peptide segment from sup35 was determined.
MISC	it is a double sheet, in which each sheet is formed from parallel segments stacked in register.
MISC	side chains protruding from the two sheets form a dry, tightly self-complementing steric zipper that bonds the sheets.
MISC	within each sheet, every segment is bound to two neighboring segments through stacks of both backbone and side-chain hydrogen bonds.
MISC	there are several computational methods for predicting a protein's propensity for amyloid fibril formation.
MISC	but the analysis of these defects revealed that the extensive exposure of hydrogen bonds to water attack might be a necessary but not sufficient condition to imply a propensity for organized aggregation citation .
MISC	a computational algorithm has been suggested that detects the nonnative strand propensity of sequences by consideration of the relationships between protein local sequence and secondary structure in terms of tertiary contacts citation.
MISC	this algorithm detects sequences within the protein that are favorable for triggering amyloid fibril formation.
MISC	it is worthwhile to emphasize here that both algorithms for prediction of amyloidogenic properties of polypeptide chains that are considered above can be applied only to those proteins for which the three-dimensional structure is known.
MISC	based on the physico chemical properties of aggregation sequences and a computational algorithm, a model was developed for predicting the aggregation rate for a broad range of polypeptide chains citation.
MISC	the model identifies aggregation sites within a protein and predicts the parallel or antiparallel organization of sheets in a fibril.
MISC	it should be noted, however, that the overpredictions of aggregation sites were not analyzed statistically.
MISC	on the other hand, there is a method for the prediction of amyloidogenic regions from amino acid sequence alone citation.
MISC	after the experimental investigation of the amyloidogenic properties of a model six-residue peptide and its mutants, the authors obtained a six-residue amyloidogenic pattern and used this pattern for the identification of amyloidogenic fragments in proteins citation.
MISC	this amyloidogenic pattern has been used to validate the premise that the amyloidogenicity of a protein is indeed localized in short protein stretches.
MISC	recently, a new method for identifying fibril-forming segments of proteins has been suggested citation.
MISC	this method is based on the threading of six-residue peptides through the known crystal structure of an amyloid fiber citation formed by the peptide from sup35.
MISC	it should be added that molecular dynamics can yield valuable information about the structural changes that arise at the atomic level upon the formation of amyloid fibrils citation citation, while such information is difficult to obtain experimentally.
MISC	another interesting new method is based on sequence-specific interaction energies between pairs of protein fragments calculated from statistical analysis of the native folds of globular proteins citation.
MISC	this algorithm correctly predicts the positions of most aggregation-prone portions of some polypeptide chains.
MISC	the formation of a sufficient number of interactions is necessary to compensate for the loss of conformational entropy during the protein folding process.
MISC	therefore, the structural uniqueness of native proteins is a result of the balance between the conformational entropy and the energy of residue interactions.
MISC	it seems that disordered regions in a protein chain do not have a sufficient number of interactions to compensate for the loss of conformational entropy that results from the formation of a globular state.
MISC	on the other hand, a large increase in the energy of interactions will lead to a loss of the unique structure because the strengthening of contact energy will speed up folding, but it is also likely to lead to erroneous folds .
MISC	it has been suggested that the lack of a rigid globular structure under physiological conditions might represent a considerable functional advantage for intrinsically disordered proteins, as their large plasticity allows them to interact efficiently with several different targets, as compared with a folded protein with limited conformational flexibility citation citation.
MISC	it has been shown that disordered regions are involved in dna binding and other types of molecular recognition citation.
OWNX	a large portion of the sequences of intrinsically disordered proteins contain segments of low complexity and high predicted flexibility citation citation.
MISC	it also has been indicated that a combination of low overall hydrophobicity and a large net charge represent a structural feature of intrinsically disordered proteins in comparison with small globular proteins citation, citation.
CONT	there are currently several widely used methods for prediction of disordered regions: globplot citation, a simple propensity-based approach for evaluating the tendency of residues to be in a regular secondary structure; pondr vl3h citation, which is able to distinguish experimentally verified disordered proteins from globular proteins by various machine learning approaches; disopred citation, in which the definition of disorder is restrained to regions that are missing from x-ray structures but are specifically recognized by a support vector machine in the disopred model; and iupred citation, which assigns the order/disorder status to residues on the basis of their ability to form favorable pairwise contacts.
OWNX	we were the first to our knowledge who used the number of contacts per residue as a parameter to distinguish folded and intrinsically disordered proteins citation.
OWNX	we have extended our method to predict disordered regions and have made comparisons with the above-mentioned methods citation.
MISC	despite considerable efforts to understand the mechanism, it is still unclear what is responsible for amyloidogenic and disordered regions.
OWNX	we introduce a new parameter, namely mean packing density, which enables the prediction of both amyloidogenic and intrinsically disordered regions from protein sequence.
MISC	pitch is one of the most important features of natural sounds, underlying the perception of melody in music and prosody in speech.
MISC	however, the temporal dynamics of pitch processing are still poorly understood.
MISC	previous studies suggest that the auditory system uses a wide range of time scales to integrate pitch-related information and that the effective integration time is both task- and stimulus-dependent.
MISC	none of the existing models of pitch processing can account for such task- and stimulus-dependent variations in processing time scales.
MISC	the model is evaluated using a range of perceptual studies, which have not previously been accounted for by a single model, and new results from a neurophysiological experiment.
MISC	the model has features in common with a hierarchical generative process and suggests a key role for efferent connections from central to sub-cortical areas in controlling the temporal dynamics of pitch processing.
MISC	modelling the neural processing of pitch is essential for understanding the perceptual phenomenology of music and speech.
MISC	pitch, one of the most important features of auditory perception, is usually associated with periodicities in sounds citation.
MISC	hence, a number of models of pitch perception are based upon a temporal analysis of the neural activity evoked by the stimulus citation citation.
MISC	most of these models compute a form of short-term autocorrelation of the simulated auditory nerve activity using an exponentially weighted integration time window citation citation.
MISC	autocorrelation models have been able to predict the reported pitches of a wide range of complex stimuli.
MISC	however, choosing an appropriate integration time window has been problematic, and none of the previous models has been able to explain the wide range of time scales encountered in perceptual data in a unified fashion.
MISC	these data show that, in certain conditions, the auditory system is capable of integrating pitch-related information over time scales of several hundred milliseconds citation citation, while at the same time being able to follow changes in pitch or pitch strength with a resolution of only a few milliseconds citation, citation, citation citation.
MISC	the trade-off between temporal integration and resolution is not exclusive to pitch perception, but is a general characteristic of auditory temporal processing.
MISC	for instance, a long integration time of several hundred milliseconds is required to explain the way in which the detectability and perceived loudness of sounds increases with increasing sound duration citation, citation.
MISC	in contrast, much shorter integration times are necessary to explain the fact that the auditory system can resolve sound events separated by only a few milliseconds citation citation.
MISC	therefore, it appears that the integration time of auditory processing varies with the stimulus and task.
OWNX	however, to our knowledge no model has yet quantitatively explained the stimulus- and task-dependency of integration time constants.
MISC	another major challenge for pitch modelling is to relate perceptual phenomena to neurophysiological data.
MISC	within this processing hierarchy, there is an increasing dispersion in response latency, with lower pitches eliciting longer response latencies than higher pitches citation.
MISC	this suggests that the time window over which the auditory system integrates pitch-related information depends on the pitch itself.
MISC	however, no attempt has yet been made to explain this latency dispersion.
OWNX	in this study, we present a unified account of the multiple time scales involved in pitch processing.
OWNX	we suggest that top-down modulation within a hierarchical processing structure is important for explaining the stimulus-dependency of the effective integration time for extracting pitch information.
MISC	the model represents a natural extension of previous autocorrelation models of pitch in a form resembling a hierarchical generative process citation, citation, in which higher levels modulate the responses in lower levels via feedback connections.
MISC	without modification, the model can account not only for a wide range of perceptual data, but also for novel neurophysiological data on pitch processing.
MISC	-actinin has an actin binding domain and a calmodulin homology domain separated by a long rod domain.
OWNX	using molecular dynamics and normal mode analysis, we suggest that the -actinin rod domain has flexible terminal regions which can twist and extend under mechanical stress, yet has a highly rigid interior region stabilized by aromatic packing within each spectrin repeat, by electrostatic interactions between the spectrin repeats, and by strong salt bridges between its two anti-parallel monomers.
OWNX	we introduce computational methods for analyzing the torsional strain of molecules using rotating constraints.
MISC	molecular dynamics extension of the -actinin rod is also performed, demonstrating transduction of the unfolding forces across salt bridges to the associated monomer of the -actinin rod domain.
MISC	cytoskeletal microfilament networks contribute to the mechanical stability of the cell by dynamically arranging and rearranging actin filaments for reinforcement.
MISC	the dynamic arrangement of actin filament requires actin filament crosslinking molecules such as -actinin.
MISC	-actinin is a 200 kda homodimer with three major structural motifs: the actin binding domain, the calmodulin homology domain, and the central rod domain citation.
MISC	actin filaments in the parallel arrangement are very dynamic; the actin filaments move laterally and horizontally in relationship to each other, and continuously bind and unbind -actinin crosslinking molecules citation.
MISC	several cellular processes involving actin filament dynamic rearrangement and scaffolding by -actinin include: focal adhesion formation near membrane bound integrin molecules citation, cytokinesis and cytoplasmic dumping in the final stages of mitosis citation, citation, and z-disk formation and stabilization in muscle cells citation.
MISC	structure of the -actinin rod domain underlies the function of -actinin as a partially flexible actin filament crosslinker.
MISC	each central rod domain monomer is 240 long and made up of 4 spectrin repeats connected by helical linkers citation, citation.
MISC	other molecules with spectrin repeats include dystophin and utrophin.
MISC	the -actinin rod domain differs from the other spectrin family molecules by its shorter length, its more rigid helical linkers, and its dimerization citation.
MISC	the spectrin repeats structure of the rod domain contributes several vital characteristics to the -actinin rod domain: aromatic packing and hydrophobic residues within each repeat stabilize secondary structure citation ; acidic and basic surfaces on r1 and r4 confer strong dimerization interactions citation, kd of 10 pm between monomers citation ; interaction of hydrophobic residues between r2 and r3 on both monomers and electrostatic interactions produce a coiled-coil homodimer conformation with a 12 degree bend and a 90 degree left handed twist citation.
MISC	together these characteristics account for the rod domain maintaining both structural rigidity and flexibility.
MISC	the coiled-coil nature of the rod domain is an essential component of the rod domain structure.
MISC	coiled-coils are the dominant conformation for fibrous proteins citation.
MISC	most coiled-coils have a heptad conformation, with hydrophobic residues every seventh residue citation, citation.
MISC	the heptad conformation allows for hydrophobic insertion of one linker region into that of the other monomers by a knobs-into-holes mechanism citation.
MISC	coiled-coils with antiparallel dimers like the -actinin rod domain are stabilized mainly by electrostatic interactions between the monomers, and within the monomers citation.
MISC	in general the knobs-into-holes mechanism of coiled-coil conformation exists only when stabilized by electrostatic interactions citation.
MISC	the tendency of electrostatic interactions to play a key role in stabilizing coiled-coil dimers like -actinin is in contrast to globular proteins, where hydrophobic, vdw, and electrostatic interactions are equally significant to molecular stability citation.
MISC	the coiled-coil conformation of the rod domain is a significant structural feature, and the significance of electrostatic interactions to coiled-coil structure stability suggests a significant role of electrostatic interactions in mechanical properties of the -actinin rod domain.
MISC	several studies have examined the mechanical properties of other molecules with rod-like coiled-coil conformations.
MISC	these studies on dna citation citation, myosin citation citation, and keratin citation, citation together suggest the coiled-coil rod like structure contributes extensible rigidity and torsional and bending flexibility.
OWNX	the tertiary structure of dna is referred to as coiled-coil, and more commonly as a double-helix, because it consists of two intertwined -helices.
MISC	in contrast, -actinin and other fibrous proteins are referred to as coiled-coil due to intertwining in their quaternary structures.
MISC	myosin has an s2 region that functions as a lever arm in muscle sarcomeres.
MISC	removing the electrostatic interactions underlying the coiled-coil conformation of keratin significantly reduces its rigidity citation.
MISC	these studies suggest that the coiled-coil conformation in -actinin contributes extension rigidity but torsional and bending flexibility.
MISC	studies of -actinin and other spectrin repeat molecules have similarly demonstrated extension rigidity of the coiled-coil rod domain citation citation.
MISC	experimental investigation using atomic force microscopy of spectrin unfolding demonstrated that spectrin repeats unfold in a cooperative mechanism citation.
MISC	several molecular dynamics investigations further characterize the extension rigidity of the -actinin rod domain as resulting from the strength of the helical linker between the spectrin repeats, and electrostatic and hydrogen bonding within each repeat citation citation.
MISC	there has been no investigation of the bending or torsional flexibility of the -actinin rod domain or other spectrin repeats, but investigation of -actinin structure using cryoelectron microscopy has shown that there must be some structural flexibility since -actinin molecules form stable actin filaments crosslinks in a range of crosslinking angles citation.
MISC	is the flexibility of -actinin in crosslinking actin filaments due to torsional and bending flexibility of the rod domain?
MISC	normal mode analysis shows that the rod-like structure of -actinin contributes towards its bending and torsional flexibility.
OWNX	our simulations suggest that aromatic packing interactions determine the trajectory of torsion on the rod domain, and that electrostatic interaction between the monomers contributes extension rigidity to the rod domain.
MISC	the mature human brain is organized into a collection of specialized functional networks that flexibly interact to support various cognitive functions.
MISC	studies of development often attempt to identify the organizing principles that guide the maturation of these functional networks.
OWNX	in this report, we combine resting state functional connectivity mri, graph analysis, community detection, and spring-embedding visualization techniques to analyze four separate networks defined in earlier studies.
OWNX	as we have previously reported, we find, across development, a trend toward segregation between regions close in anatomical space and integration between selected regions distant in space.
MISC	the generalization of these earlier trends across multiple networks suggests that this is a general developmental principle for changes in functional connectivity that would extend to large-scale graph theoretic analyses of large-scale brain networks.
MISC	communities in children are predominantly arranged by anatomical proximity, while communities in adults predominantly reflect functional relationships, as defined from adult fmri studies.
MISC	in sum, over development, the organization of multiple functional networks shifts from a local anatomical emphasis in children to a more distributed architecture in young adults.
OWNX	further, graph metrics are similar in child and adult graphs, with both showing small-world -like properties, while community detection by modularity optimization reveals stable communities within the graphs that are clearly different between young children and young adults.
MISC	these observations suggest that early school age children and adults both have relatively efficient systems that may solve similar information processing problems in divergent ways.
MISC	the mature human brain is both structurally and functionally specialized, such that discrete areas of the cerebral cortex perform distinct types of information processing.
MISC	these areas are organized into functional networks that flexibly interact to support various cognitive functions.
MISC	studies of development often attempt to identify the organizing principles that guide the maturation of these functional networks.
MISC	citation citation .
MISC	a major portion of the work investigating the nature of functional human brain development is based on results from functional magnetic resonance imaging studies.
MISC	by examining the differences in the fmri activation profile of a particular brain region between children, adolescents, and adults, the developmental trajectory of that region's involvement in a cognitive task can be outlined citation, citation, citation citation.
OWNX	these experiments have been crucial to our current understanding of typical and atypical brain development.
MISC	in addition to fmri activation studies, the relatively new and increasingly utilized method of resting state functional connectivity mri allows for a complementary examination of the functional relationships between regions across development.
MISC	resting state fcmri is based on the discovery that spontaneous low-frequency blood oxygen level dependent signal fluctuations in sometimes distant, but functionally-related grey matter regions, show strong correlations at rest citation.
MISC	in effect, rs-fcmri evaluates regional interactions that occur when a subject is not performing an explicit task citation, citation, citation citation.
MISC	to date, rs-fcmri has been used in several domains to examine systems-level organization of motor citation, memory citation, citation, attention citation, and task control systems citation, citation, citation .
MISC	in addition, because rs-fcmri does not require active engagement in a behavioral task, it unburdens experimental design, subject compliance, and training demands.
MISC	thus, rs-fcmri is becoming a frequently used tool for examining changes in network structure in disease citation citation, in aging citation, citation, and across development citation, citation citation .
OWNX	in previous work regarding task-level control in adults, we applied rs-fcmri to a set of regions derived from an fmri meta-analysis that included studies of control-demanding tasks.
MISC	this analysis revealed that brain regions exhibiting different combinations of control signals across many tasks are grouped into distinct fronto-parietal and cingulo-opercular functional networks citation, citation.
MISC	based on functional activation profiles of these regions characterized in the previous fmri study, the fronto-parietal network appears to act on a shorter timescale, initiating and adjusting top-down control.
MISC	along with these two task control networks citation, citation, a set of cerebellar regions showing error-related activity across tasks citation formed a separate cerebellar network.
MISC	in adults, the cerebellar network is functionally connected with both the fronto-parietal and cingulo-opercular networks citation, citation.
MISC	another functional network, and one of the most prominent sets of regions to be examined with rs-fcmri, is the default mode network.
MISC	the default mode network was first characterized by a consistent decrease in activity during goal-directed tasks compared to baseline citation, citation.
MISC	resting-state fcmri analyses have repeatedly shown that these regions, along with associated medial temporal regions, are correlated at rest in adults citation, citation, citation, citation.
MISC	while the distinct function of the default mode network is often linked to internally directed mental activity citation, this notion continues to be debated citation, citation, citation citation .
MISC	tf modifications such as reversible phosphorylation and missense mutations, which can act independent of tf expression level, are overlooked by differential expression analysis.
OWNX	using bovine piedmontese myostatin mutants as proof-of-concept, we propose a new algorithm that correctly identifies the gene containing the causal mutation from microarray data alone.
MISC	the myostatin mutation releases the brakes on piedmontese muscle growth by translating a dysfunctional protein.
OWNX	compared to a less muscular non-mutant breed we find that myostatin is not differentially expressed at any of ten developmental time points.
MISC	the entirely data-driven weighting procedure emphasises regulatory movement relative to the phenotypically relevant part of the network.
MISC	in contrast to other published methods that compare co-expression networks, significance testing is not used to eliminate connections.
MISC	evolution, normal development, immune responses and aberrant processes such as diseases and cancer all involve at least some rewiring of regulatory circuits citation citation.
MISC	the key nodes in regulatory circuits are frequently transcription factors citation.
MISC	thus, there is a great deal of interest in developing methods for decoding tf changes.
MISC	furthermore, the recruitment of a tf to a promoter does not necessarily correlate with transcriptional status, so biological interpretation can be complex citation.
MISC	likely sites of key regulatory mutations can be revealed by whole genome scans but this approach requires large numbers of individuals and very dense snp panels.
MISC	even so, the exact causal gene may remain ambiguous if there are several genes near the marker.
MISC	in any case, little insight is gained into the underlying regulatory mechanisms.
MISC	to date, they all operate by integrating information from multiple levels of biological organisation particularly eqtl, protein-protein interaction and tf binding site data citation citation .
MISC	identifying regulatory change solely through contrasts in gene expression data has been elusive because tf tend to be stably expressed at baseline levels citation close to the sensitivity of standard high-throughput expression profiling platforms.
MISC	to allow reliable evaluation of such a hypothesis a well-defined experimental model system is required.
MISC	piedmontese cattle are double-muscled because they possess a genomic dna mutation in the myostatin mrna transcript citation.
OWNX	the resulting dysfunctional myostatin protein is a transcriptional regulator that releases the brakes on muscle growth reflecting the importance of tgf- signalling pathways in the determination of final muscle mass and fibre composition citation, citation.
OWNX	thus we have a system in which we know the identity of the gene containing the causal mutation, myostatin, but we cannot identify it by de of the mrna in muscle samples.
OWNX	by contrasting the muscle transcriptomes of the piedmontese and wagyu crosses across 10 developmental time points, our aim was to establish the question to which myostatin is the answer.
OWNX	in other words, what question do we need to ask of the gene expression data for it to reveal the identity of the transcriptional regulator containing the causal mutation?
OWNX	we study the evolution of cooperation under indirect reciprocity, believed to constitute the biological basis of morality.
OWNX	we employ an evolutionary game theoretical model of multilevel selection, and show that natural selection and mutation lead to the emergence of a robust and simple social norm, which we call stern-judging.
MISC	similarly for tit-for-tat and win-stay-lose-shift, the simplest ubiquitous strategies in direct reciprocity, the lack of ambiguity of stern-judging, where implacable punishment is compensated by prompt forgiving, supports the idea that simplicity is often associated with evolutionary success.
MISC	many biological systems employ cooperative interactions in their organization citation.
MISC	this contrasts with the general assumption that the strong and selfish individuals are the ones who benefit most from natural selection.
MISC	this being the case, how is it possible that unselfish behaviour has survived evolution?
MISC	adopting the terminology resulting from the seminal work of hamilton, trivers, and wilson citation citation, an act is altruistic if it confers a benefit b to another individual in spite of accruing a cost c to the altruist.
MISC	in this context, several mechanisms have been invoked to explain the evolution of altruism, but only recently an evolutionary model of indirect reciprocity has been developed by nowak and sigmund citation, which, with remarkable simplicity, addressed unique aspects of human sociality, such as trust, gossip, and reputation citation.
MISC	as a means of community enforcement, indirect reciprocity had been investigated earlier in the context of economics, notably by sugden citation and kandori citation.
MISC	more recently, many studies citation, citation, citation citation have been devoted to investigating how altruism can evolve under indirect reciprocity.
MISC	indeed, according to alexander citation, indirect reciprocity presumably provides the mechanism that distinguishes us humans from all other living species on earth.
MISC	moreover, as recently argued in citation, indirect reciprocity may have provided the selective challenge driving the cerebral expansion in human evolution.
MISC	each player can experience many rounds, but never with the same partner twice, direct retaliation being unfeasible.
MISC	by helping another individual, a given player may increase her reputation, which may change the predisposition of others to help her in future interactions.
MISC	previous studies of reputation-based models of cooperation reviewed recently citation indicate that cooperation outweighs defection whenever, among other factors, assessment of actions is based on norms that require considerable cognitive capacities citation, citation, citation, even when individuals are capable of making binary assessments only, in a world in black and white citation, as assumed in most recent studies.
MISC	furthermore, stable cooperation hinges on the availability of reliable reputation information citation.
MISC	such high cognitive capacity contrasts with technology-based interactions, such as e-trade, which also rely on reputation-based mechanisms of cooperation citation citation.
MISC	indeed, anonymous one-shot interactions between individuals loosely connected and geographically dispersed usually dominate e-trade, raising issues of trust-building and moral hazard citation.
MISC	reputation in e-trade is introduced via a feedback mechanism which announces the ratings of sellers.
MISC	despite the success and high levels of cooperation observed in e-trade, it has been found citation that publicizing a detailed account of the seller's feedback history does not improve cooperation, as compared with publicizing only the seller's most recent rating.
MISC	let us consider a world in black and white consisting of a set of tribes, such that each tribe lives under the influence of a single norm, common to all individuals.
MISC	each individual engages once in the indirect reciprocity game with all other tribe inhabitants.
MISC	reputations are public: this means that the result of every interaction is made available to everyone through the indirect observation model introduced in citation.
MISC	on the other hand, this requires a way to spread the information to the entire population.
MISC	consistently, language seems to be an important cooperation promoter citation, although recent mechanisms of reputation-spreading rely on electronic databases.
MISC	since reputations are either good or bad, there are 2 4 16 possible strategies.
MISC	on the other hand, the number of possible norms depends on their associated order.
MISC	the simplest are the so-called first-order norms, in which all that matters is the action taken by the donor.
MISC	in second-order norms, the reputation of one of the players also contributes to decide the new reputation of the donor.
OWNX	and so on, in increasing layers of complexity as shown in figure 2, which illustrates the features of third-order norms such as those we shall employ here.
MISC	any individual in the tribe shares the same norm, which in turn raises the question of how each inhabitant acquired it.
MISC	however, inasmuch as indirect reciprocity is associated with community enforcement citation, citation, one may assume, for simplicity, that norms are acquired through an educational process.
MISC	moreover, it is likely that a common norm contributes to the overall cohesiveness and identity of a tribe.
MISC	it is noteworthy, however, that if norms were different for different individuals, the indirect observation model would not be valid, as it requires trust in judgments made by co-inhabitants.
MISC	when individuals reproduce, they replace their strategy by that of another individual from the same tribe, chosen proportional to her accumulated payoff citation.
MISC	the most successful individuals in each tribe have a higher reproductive success.
MISC	since different tribes are under the influence of different norms, the overall fitness of each tribe will vary from tribe to tribe, as well as the plethora of successful strategies that thrive in each tribe.
MISC	tribes engage in pairwise conflicts with a small probability, associated with selection between tribes.
OWNX	after each conflict, the norm of the defeated tribe will change toward the norm of the victor tribe, as detailed in the methods section.
OWNX	we perform extensive computer simulations of evolutionary dynamics of sets of 64 tribes, each with 64 inhabitants.
OWNX	once a stationary regime is reached, we collect information for subsequent statistical analysis.
OWNX	we compute the frequency of occurrence of bits 1 and 0 in each of the 8-bit locations.
MISC	a bit is said to fixate if its frequency of occurrence exceeds or equals 98 percent.
OWNX	we analyze 500 simulations for the same value of b, subsequently computing the frequency of occurrence 1, 0, and x of the bits 1, 0, and x, respectively.
MISC	if 1 0 x, the final bit is 1; if 0 1 x, the final bit is 0; otherwise we assume it is indeterminate, and denote it by.
MISC	certainly, a co-evolutionary process would be more appropriate, and this will be explored in future work.
MISC	angiogenesis plays a crucial role in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and wound healing.
MISC	vascular endothelial growth factor is a critical regulator of angiogenesis.
MISC	multiple vegf receptors are expressed on endothelial cells, including signaling receptor tyrosine kinases and the nonsignaling co-receptor neuropilin-1.
OWNX	using the first molecularly detailed computational model of vegf and its receptors, we have shown previously that the vegfr neuropilin interactions explain the observed differential effects of vegf isoforms on vegf signaling in vitro, and demonstrated potent vegf inhibition by an antibody to neuropilin-1 that does not block ligand binding but blocks subsequent receptor coupling.
MISC	the model predicts that blockade of neuropilin vegfr coupling is significantly more effective than other approaches in decreasing vegf vegfr2 signaling.
MISC	in designing human therapeutics, the mechanism of attacking the target plays a significant role in the outcome: of the strategies tested here, drugs with similar properties to the neuropilin-1 antibody are predicted to be most effective.
OWNX	the tumor type and the microenvironment of the target tissue are also significant in determining therapeutic efficacy of each of the treatments studied.
MISC	angiogenesis, the growth of new blood microvessels from preexisting microvasculature, is a critical physiological process for the growth of developing organs and during wound healing, ovulation, and pregnancy.
MISC	coronary or peripheral ischemia may be relieved by inducing angiogenesis citation, citation, while diseases of hypervascularization, such as cancer or diabetic retinopathy, are targets of anti-angiogenic drugs citation, citation.
MISC	neuronal expression of angiogenic receptors citation, citation suggests that this work may also be relevant to the development nervous system.
OWNX	in this study, we predict that three methods of targeting the same molecule result in distinct therapeutic outcomes, and that one of these methods is more effective than the others.
OWNX	in addition, the microenvironment in which the drug is to act for example, the expression level of receptors in the tissue is a critical factor in the impact of the therapy.
MISC	vascular endothelial growth factor is a family of secreted glycoproteins and critical regulators of angiogenesis citation, citation.
MISC	in vitro, vegf increases endothelial cell survival, proliferation, and migration.
MISC	in vivo, it increases vascular permeability, activates endothelial cells, and acts as a chemoattractant for nascent vessel sprouts.
MISC	both isoforms bind to the vegf receptor tyrosine kinases to induce signals.
MISC	the binding sites on vegf 165 for vegfr2 and neuropilin-1 are nonoverlapping, so vegf 165 may bind both simultaneously citation.
MISC	vegf 121 can only form vegfr2 complexes directly citation.
OWNX	we showed that vegfr2 neuropilin coupling is sufficient to account for the observed differential effects of vegf isoforms on multiple cell types and that our model reproduces the distinct vegf binding and signaling effects on each of these cell types citation, citation citation.
OWNX	here, we extend that validated model of the molecular interactions of the vegf family and its receptors to predict the in vivo behavior of the system by including the ecm and basement membranes, as well as multiple cell types and geometrical parameters characteristic of the tissue.
MISC	first, a blockade of neuropilin-1 expression may be induced by use of sirna or other methods to prevent the synthesis of the protein in the cells.
MISC	second, a protein that occupies the vegf binding site on neuropilin-1 can compete with vegf 165 for binding to that receptor.
MISC	full-length plgf 2 binds neuropilin-1 and vegfr1 citation.
MISC	this protein has been used to block vegf binding to neuropilin in vitro citation, citation.
MISC	an alternative would be a neuropilin-binding fragment of vegf 165 itself citation, citation.
OWNX	third, we may block the interaction between neuropilins and the vegfrs, preventing the presentation of vegf 165 to the signaling receptor, but permitting neuropilin to sequester that isoform.
OWNX	this is the first computational model to our knowledge to include the interactions of the vegf family and their receptors explicitly and in biophysical detail.
MISC	all the parameters for the model have been obtained from previously published experimental data.
OWNX	the geometrical parameters of the tissue under investigation here are also incorporated into the model: interstitial space, tumor cell volume and surface area, microvessel volume and surface area.
MISC	the results presented here are therefore tissue-specific, but the model may be applied to other tissues.
OWNX	vegfr2 is the primary signaling receptor for vegf, and we first analyze the results of the model for a tissue in which the endothelial cells express vegfr2 and neuropilin-1, but not vegfr1; the effect of vegfr1 is considered later.
OWNX	initially, the system is in a steady state, as vegf is secreted by the parenchymal cells and internalized by the endothelial cells, resulting in a flux through the interstitial space and the ecm.
OWNX	one of three treatments is initiated at time zero and the time course of vegf binding followed for 48 hours.
MISC	vegf vegfr2 and vegf vegfr1 binding are taken as a surrogate for vegf signaling.
MISC	biophysically detailed models of single cells are difficult to fit to real data.
MISC	recent advances in imaging techniques allow simultaneous access to various intracellular variables, and these data can be used to significantly facilitate the modelling task.
OWNX	we extend previous techniques to take the noisy nature of the measurements into account.
MISC	sequential monte carlo methods, in combination with a detailed biophysical description of a cell, are used for principled, model-based smoothing of noisy recording data.
OWNX	we also provide an alternative formulation of smoothing where the neural nonlinearities are estimated in a non-parametric manner.
MISC	biophysically important parameters of detailed models are inferred automatically from noisy data via expectation-maximisation.
OWNX	overall, we find that model-based smoothing is a powerful, robust technique for smoothing of noisy biophysical data and for inference of biophysical parameters in the face of recording noise.
MISC	recent advances in imaging techniques allow measurements of time-varying biophysical quantities of interest at high spatial and temporal resolution.
MISC	for example, voltage-sensitive dye imaging allows the observation of the backpropagation of individual action potentials up the dendritic tree citation citation.
MISC	calcium imaging techniques similarly allow imaging of synaptic events in individual synapses.
MISC	such data are very well-suited to constrain biophysically detailed models of single cells.
MISC	both the dimensionality of the parameter space and the noisy and undersampled nature of the observed data renders the use of statistical techniques desirable.
OWNX	in a first step, we will do this while inferring biophysically detailed models; in a second step, by inferring non-parametric models of the cellular nonlinearities.
MISC	given the laborious nature of building biophysically detailed cellular models by hand citation citation, there has long been a strong emphasis on robust automatic methods citation citation.
MISC	the neurofitter citation package, for example, provides tight integration with a number of standard simulation tools; implements a large number of search methods; and uses a combination of a wide variety of cost functions to measure the quality of a model's fit to the data.
OWNX	these are, however, highly complex approaches that, while extremely flexible, arguably make optimal use neither of the richness of the structure present in the statistical problem nor of the richness of new data emerging from imaging techniques.
MISC	in the past, it has been shown by us and others citation, citation citation that knowledge of the true transmembrane voltage decouples a number of fundamental parameters, allowing simultaneous estimation of the spatial distribution of multiple kinetically differing conductances; of intercompartmental conductances; and of time-varying synaptic input.
MISC	importantly, this inference problem has the form of a constrained linear regression with a single, global optimum for all these parameters given the data.
MISC	none of these approaches, however, at present take the various noise sources in recording situations explicitly into account.
OWNX	here, we extend the findings from citation, applying standard inference procedures to well-founded statistical descriptions of the recording situations in the hope that this more specifically tailored approach will provide computationally cheaper, more flexible, robust solutions, and that a probabilistic approach will allow noise to be addressed in a principled manner.
OWNX	specifically, we approach the issue of noisy observations and interpolation of undersampled data first in a model-based, and then in a model-free setting.
OWNX	we start by exploring how an accurate description of a cell can be used for optimal de-noising and to infer unobserved variables, such as ca 2 concentration from voltage.
OWNX	the maximisation step here turns out to be a weighted version of our previous regression-based inference method, which assumed exact knowledge of the biophysical signals.
OWNX	the overview will be couched in terms of voltage measurements, but we later also consider measurements of calcium concentrations.
MISC	note the important factor formula which ensures that the noise variance grows linearly with time formula.
OWNX	the currents formula we will consider here are of three types:
MISC	for example, for the hodgkin and huxley k -channel, the kinetics are given by formula, withformulaand formula themselves nonlinear functions of the voltage citation and we again have an additive noise term.
MISC	similar equations can be formulated for other variables such as the intracellular free ca 2 concentration citation .
MISC	recently, though, several groups have reported that there may be an alternate strategy.
MISC	the reports show that reliable statistical models can be built without knowledge of all the interactions in a system; instead, pairwise interactions can suffice.
OWNX	our results show that, in most cases, they will not.
MISC	the reason is that there is a crossover in the predictive power of pairwise models: if the size of the subsystem is below the crossover point, then the results have no predictive power for large systems.
MISC	if the size is above the crossover point, then the results may have predictive power.
MISC	this work thus provides a general framework for determining the extent to which pairwise models can be used to predict the behavior of large biological systems.
MISC	applied to neural data, the size of most systems studied so far is below the crossover point.
